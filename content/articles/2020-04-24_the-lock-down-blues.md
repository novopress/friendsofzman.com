Since the pandemic crackdown started, the question was when would people
start to realize that this was a huge blunder. In the first weeks,
people were both scared and excited about what they were being told was
coming. On the one hand you had the rush for supplies in order to camp
at home for weeks. On the other hand, you had the excitement for an
unplanned holiday at home. A month ago, most everyone was ready for a
couple of weeks of curve bending and movie watching at home.

We are at the other end of this thing now. People have done all of the
fun stuff they can do at home. It’s just tedium now. For many the fear
of not having an income is beginning to take center stage. Small
business is getting to the point where many will have to close up shop
for good. Fear of the virus has now subsided for all but the most
hysterical and fear of ruination is now beginning to fill the void.
People are getting antsy and want to go back to their lives now. This is
not fun anymore.

The streets are starting to get more crowded now. A week ago, you could
ride around Lagos and not see a soul walking or driving. The weather has
improved, so many more people are outside. More cars are on the streets.
Most business is now thinking hard about going back to near-normal in
the near-term. They don’t want to be too far ahead of the government’s
crackdown orders, for fear of lawsuits, but they are pushing to end the
madness and return to something close to normal.

That’s the thing that no one has considered. There will be real economic
hardship this summer due to the crackdown. People will also be sharing
their crackdown stories with friends and co-workers over the coming
months. People will certainly notice that they don’t know anyone who
knows anyone that got the virus. As these antibody tests confirm that
the fatality rate was much lower than advertised, people will begin to
wonder if this was worth the consequences.

Adolf Hitler said, “You can fool all the people some of the time and
some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all
the time.” We are seeing a real-time test of that aphorism. For a while
now, our rulers have fooled most everyone with the virus panic. Some
people, like the curve-benders, will remain convinced the virus panic
was necessary. They have no choice now. The question is will the bulk of
the public conclude they were fooled into the Great Flu Panic?

This is where the aphorism breaks down. People seem to be quite happy
being fooled on a regular basis. The rulers and the media have to mix
things up, but being fooled into believing in some great threat to “who
we are” is a feature, not a bug. Then again, prior hoaxes and panics
have been cost free. People could enjoy them from the comfort of home
and still go outside and keep their job. This time, there will be a real
cost to this elaborate morality tale. Maybe this time is different.

Either way, we are about to move into a new phase of this madness. What
will be the short- and long-term consequences of the crackdown? The
stock market seems to think the V-shaped recession is the way to bet.
The political class is hoping for devastation, as they think they will
rid them of Trump. Economist can’t seem to agree on what comes next, as
this has never been tried. There’s lots of red lights flashing in the
debt markets and the supply chain. The next months will be interesting.

Maybe that will be how everyone forgets about this month of living like
lepers and treating everyone like they stink. Before people can start to
think about why they were locked in their homes, they will be directed
to the next drama, the financial and economic panic of 2020. Perhaps the
lesson here is the circus part of our bread and circuses is the
government creating increasingly reckless panics seeing if they can blow
it all up. Maybe this is all for *their* entertainment.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
