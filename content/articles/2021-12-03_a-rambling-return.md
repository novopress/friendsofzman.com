I wanted to keep the shows light this month because it is the time of
year when we should be in high spirits. This is my favorite time of
year. We have the holidays and the year is winding down. We have the
start of a new year to look forward to and the culmination of another
year. It is a good time to take stock of things, count your blessings
and gear up for what comes next. Plus, it gets dark early and the
weather is turning to winter. This is the best time of year.

With that in mind I scanned the news sites looking for material and I
was struck by a couple of things. First off, the people in charge are
miserable. Everything is going sideways for them and they have no idea
why. Reading the news items about the economy makes clear that they are
in deep denial. We have inflation, shortages and a totally screwed up
labor market. This is making their Build Back Better scheme look
dangerously ridiculous to the public.

It is not just the economy. These idiots not only created a new cold war
with the Russians but may be on the brink of a hot war. This Ukraine
fiasco is entirely the fault of official Washington. They got in bed
with the Ukrainian crooks because they liked the bribes and they picked
a fight with Putin because of Trump. Now the Russian army is on the
doorstep of Europe. The Ukrainian people deserve better, of course, but
the blame largely lies with the incompetent idiots in Washington.

Everywhere you look, things are crumbling for the regime. The best and
most amusing part of it all is that Team Biden is telling the party that
they plan to run his corpse again for president in 2024. Of course, the
party cannot push him aside because next in line is Kamala Harris, a
woman less popular than rectal cancer. The whole thing is a disaster for
the inner party and they seem to know it. Given the troubles on the
horizon, 2022 promise to be nothing but misery for them.

As I said in the show, the GOP will probably benefit, but people are
starting to smarten up a bit regarding their act. Read the comments of
their party organs and you see lots of bitterness toward the party. You
see this in daily life as well. The old red team/blue team stuff is
falling apart quickly. I have heard more than a few civic nationalist
types lament the fact that they no longer have a party. I suspect GOP
voters are going to be looking at primary challengers in many races.

It is not all puppies and kittens. When the rulers screw up the people
suffer and there is going to be plenty of suffering in 2022. Inflation
means higher interest rates and that means big trouble for the economy
and the stock market. It has been forty years since that has been
necessary. Millions of retirees are not going to be happy with how the
rulers fix the economy over the next 18 months. The short term is going
to be a difficult time for normal people.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
