I have been a reading a biography of Nikolai Bukharin, probably the
second most important Bolshevik theorists after Lenin. You cannot read
about old commies without also reading about their ideology. These guys
were consumed with politics and the disputes about politics. All of
their relationships were through politics, usually along ideological
lines. In fact, they never seemed to have genuine friendships, just
ideological allies in the many ideological disputes at the time.

The Bolsheviks were a lot like the intensely on-line people of today.
The people who make Twitter what it is are 100% committed to both their
politics and the life of politics they experience on-line. It is why
every minor disagreement becomes a great drama that always ends in
tears. Bukharin and Lenin would have big fights over what turned out to
be trivial difference in language. Of course, all of the old commies
were fond of denouncing one another as deviationists.

Another thing that shines through when reading about the old communists
is they had a Calvinist’s faith in their own destiny. The inevitable end
of capitalism was as certain to them that the sun would rising in the
morning and setting in the evening. Their only concern was in mapping
out how it would eventually meet its end. They made some very prudent
observations about what they called capitalism. In fact, they gave us
the word capitalism as a label for what they observed at the time.

The weird thing about their observations of capitalism is that you get
the sense that their good observations were accidents. They were so
obsessed with proving the inevitability of communism, they looked past
their bets observations about the present. Often, they would focus on
the nutty claims about the present, rather than the insightful one,
because the nutty claim fit their narrative. The French Revolution reads
like a new madness gripping humanity. Communism has the same feel.

The funny thing is though, all political theorists on the Left, I would
place libertarians on the Left as well, had this assumption about their
politics. Once they arrived at some sort of theoretical framework to
explain the world, they started to assume that events would naturally
arrive at some determined end point. The superiority of markets would
inevitably triumph over central planning. The moral superiority of
communism would inevitably lead to revolution and the end of capitalism.

Of course, this determinism is prominent with our rulers. They are
always reminding us that they are on the right side of history. That is
their get out of jail free card, which allows them to dismiss critics.
The communists were like this. The logic errors in Marx were dismissed
as technical issues that would work themselves out as capitalism reached
its denouement and socialism rose up as the inevitable replacement. It
was the source of their fanaticism, this certainty about what was coming
next.

Interestingly, this fixation on the inevitable future led them to do no
thinking about the details of that future. This is something we see
today. On the one hand, their sense of historical inevitability drove
them to smash the present, but it prevented them from thinking about the
details of that inevitable future. We see this today with the latest
spasms of the cultural revolution. They are sure that white people will
not be in the glorious future, but how that will work is never
considered.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
