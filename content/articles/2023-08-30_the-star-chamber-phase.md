other things. For those missing the sound of me droning on each Friday,

The term “star chamber” has fallen out of use over the last few decades,
but it was a common term used by the American Left in the 20th century.
They would use it when arguing that the courts were acting arbitrarily.
Other times they would use it in the context of public opinion when one
of their guys was in trouble. The point was that the media was being
unfair to their guy. Star chambers were bad so anything with those words
associated with it must be bad too.

The Star Chamber was a real thing. It was an English court setup in the
15th century to oversee cases involving socially and political important
people. This court was staffed with advisors to the king. This way the
judges would not be intimidated by the status of the accused. No one
knows for sure how it got the name “star chamber” but the most popular
theory says it comes from the decorations. The ceiling was painted with
gold stars on a blue background.

Of course, like all government power, it was soon abused by the people
wielding it to first attack their enemies in court and then to suppress
dissent. The main reason it was subverted into an instrument of
oppression is it lacked due process. There was no appealing the
decisions of the court and since it operated by its own rules, there
could be no appeal to a fixed set of rules. This allowed the king to use
the system to persecute his enemies and stamp out dissent.

It is why up until the last few decades, the American court system was
based on a fixed set of rules that governed all courts. This was ensured
by an appeals system that ended with the Supreme Court. Forgotten today,
the primary purpose of the Supreme Court was to make sure the court
system followed the rules, the primary source of which is the
Constitution itself. The courts being open to the public was an
additional check on abuse of the legal system by the powerful.

The reason “star chamber” has fallen out of fashion in America is the
Left has seized control of the institutions, including the centers of
cultural production. They no longer look at the abuse of power as a
problem because they have all the power so by definition all uses of
power are justified. Note that their objections to the secret courts
created after 9/11 were ceremonial and halfhearted. In reality they
welcomed this new tool they could use in pursuit of their agenda.

Note also that the only thing we know about these secret courts is they
were used against Donald Trump in the 2016 election. To date no one has
produced an example of how these courts prevented terrorism. The
documented abuses of these secret courts by the FBI have gone
unaddressed. Because the courts are secret, we have no idea what goes on
inside them, so there is no way to know they are not being used against
dissidents in the same way they were used against Trump.

Putting that aside, the court system we can see is also going through a
transformation toward the Star Chamber model. Again, Trump provides some
examples. In his Florida case the court has warned him about making
public statements. There is the threat of a gag order hanging over him.
In Washington, Jack Smith has asked the court for what amounts to a gag
order on Trump. In Georgia, Trump cancelled a press conference about the
case for fear of retribution from the court.

Since we get our information about court proceedings from the media and
the media is now an agent of the state, it is not hard to see why
proscribed people would want to have their say outside the courthouse.
The only chance for fairness in the courtroom now is for the accused to
make his appeals outside the courthouse. Naturally, the courts now wish
to stifle such conduct. If they can gag the accused, he cannot shine a
light on the abuses inside the court through appeals to the public.

This is not just a phenomenon in high profile political cases.
Increasingly, local judges and prosecutors are doing the same thing. <a
href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/05/former-florida-qb-jalen-kitna-breaks-silence-following-child-porn-case/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is a case of a famous college
football player accused of heinous crimes. If you read between the
lines, he was framed by the cops but was forced to remain quiet in order
to get out of the case. He comes from money and his father is famous,
but none of that matters in a court system that is increasingly the tool
of arbitrary state power.

The difference between the rule of law and rule by men is that the
former has a clear and precises set of rules open to the public, while
the latter is based on the momentary whims of the people who wield
power. The proliferation of laws along with a proliferation of ways to
interpret the laws has made everything illegal. No one can now
<a href="https://clarifacts.com/federal-crimes-list/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">list</a> all of the federal crimes on the books. As a
result, most people are breaking the law
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594035229/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">every day</a> of their life without knowing it.

The reason this matters is one of the predicates for social upheaval,
like civil wars and revolutions, is the collapse of trust in the law.
The Star Chamber system, for example, ended with the English Civil War.
The American Revolution was, in part, a response to the collapse of
legal authority. The American Civil War was due, in part, to a collapse
in trust by both sides in the courts fairly dealing with the slavery
issue. The legal system no longer provided a solution to disputes.

When no one trusts the law or the legal system, no one has a reason to
obey the rules, much less respect the system that creates them. Put
another way, when everyone is in violation of the law, then everyone is
motivated to live outside the law. This is the fundamental definition of
the outlaw. He is an outlaw because he rejects the system of laws and
therefore exists outside the law. This is also the starting place for
every revolutionary and revolutionary movement.

In the end, the test of a legal system is the test of a society. That
is, how much protection does it provide to those with the least power. A
society that provides only protection to the powerful is a tyranny. A
legal system that provides no protection to those without power from
those with power is also a tyranny. The Star Chamber became the symbol
of tyrannical rule because it was the instrument of tyranny, just as our
legal system is today.
