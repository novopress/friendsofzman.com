Charles Haywood of Worthy House has a <a
href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2023/10/02/on-the-principle-no-enemies-on-the-right/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> up explaining and defending his
concept of “No Enemies On The Right”, which he originally formulated as
“No Enemies To The Right” last December. He used that original phrase
when discussing the jihad led by Rod Dreher against a schoolteacher who
was accused of heresy. Dreher was
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=28818" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">doing</a> his Christian piety act to both attack someone
who could not defend himself and to curry favor with the people he
pretends to oppose.

Dreher <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/a-new-enemy-to-the-right/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">panicked</a> when Haywood used the phrase
“No Enemies To The Right” because it would be very bad for business if
people embraced it. Like everyone in for-hire conservative politics,
Dreher exists to attack people to his right. That is his reason to exist
and why rich people fund his operations. What we insist on calling the
Right in America is primarily a policing operation. They impose the
morality of the Left on the rabble that the Right is charged with
keeping at bay.

Over the last year, Haywood has defended his original argument, refining
it as necessary, in response to criticism. Haywood has no interest in
becoming the Emily Post of right-wing politics, but his continuing work
on this concept is producing something like a rulebook of right-wing
etiquette. His ten-point outline for what he means by “No Enemies On The
Right” should be viewed as a useful guide for discourse between the
various groups in dissident politics.

The slogan “No Enemies On The Right” is not new to Haywood. Those around
way back in the alt-right days, which feels like a lifetime ago now,
will recall this was a slogan with some of the more popular figures in
that space. In fact, it was the motivation for organizing the Unite The
Right rally in Charlottesville. The idea was to both bring everyone
together but also break the pattern of the Left pitting one group
against the other to enforce their moral code.

Amusingly, before the alt-right used the term, it was a popular way for
the neocons to stamp out dissent during the Bush presidency. They <a
href="https://nationalinterest.org/article/no-enemies-on-the-right-742"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> in the runup to the 2004
election that their war plans were too important to let the many lies of
the Bush administration divide the Right. Their basic argument was
“Sure, Bush is Lyndon Johnson, but the Democrats are worse, so you have
to hold your nose and vote for the guy who is the opposite of what we
promised.”

Of course, like everything political on the Right, this concept has been
lifted from the Left, which coined the term “No Enemies to the Left”
during the French Revolution for the same reason Haywood is promoting
his version today. Opposing the King and the aristocracy was too
important to let petty squabbles drive the many opponents of the regime
into the ghetto of endless quarreling. Overthrow the system first then
everyone can argue about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">what comes next</a>.

There is an obvious appeal in this age. The one thing everyone outside
the political class can agree upon is the system now only works to serve
the interest of the people at the upper reaches of the system. There is
a zero-sum game mindset in the ruling class where they assume what is
good for them is bad for the people, so what is bad for the people must
be good for them. The result is a system run by people who hate the
people over whom they rule.

The logical answer is to hate them back. Since the people have numbers,
the only way to use this advantage is to unite enough people under an
opposition banner that has as its singular goal the removal of the
ruling class. This is why this idea terrifies the house slaves of
Conservative Inc. They know exactly what this means, which is the
toppling of the people who keep them in the lifestyle they think they
deserve. From the point of view of people like Rod Dreher, it is Only
Enemies On The Right.

There is another advantage to this mode of thought. It forces clarity on
the politics of dissent that helps flush out the poseurs and profiteers.
Those committed to the larger project will refuse to condemn anyone on
their side for crimes against the regime or regime orthodoxy. At most
they remain silent. The poseurs and profiteers are always quick to point
their bony finger at someone and condemn him for violating the morality
of the opposition, like you see with Rod Dreher.

There is one major flaw with the “No Enemies On The Right” concept. It
makes it difficult to police the ranks for lunatics and crackpots.
Populist politics has always struggled with the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=26197" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">weirdo problem</a> precisely because it is unwilling to
criticize anyone willing to join the fight against the Left. You can
chant “No Enemies On The Right!” until you are blue in the face, but you
must have some way to filter out the lunatics or you end up being
defined by them.

There is also the problem of what constitutes the Right. The drug addled
Antifa marchers oppose the system, but they are not of the Right. Jimmy
Dore, the old school progressive comic, opposes the regime, but he is a
socialist. The Grey Zone people oppose the America military machine, but
they are communists. There has to be something more than opposition to
the Left or you end up putting a leash around your neck and handing the
other end to people you hate.

This leads to the third problem, which Haywood addresses in his seventh
item in his list of “Tenets of NEOTR.” Disagreement is vital for any
opposition to the regime as this is the only way to improve the
opposition. Ideas need to be debated and that often results in hurt
feelings, which leads to public disputes. Chanting “No Enemies On The
Right” in these times will just alienate the people in the dispute.
There needs to be a way to argue but in a way that keeps the focus on
the enemy.

Finally, there is no escaping the fact that this is not a new idea and
prior efforts at practicing it have failed. There is a reason it has
failed. The main reason is the people chanting it were never really
serious about it. Instead, they tended to use it as a shield to ward off
criticism. This is how we got to Charlottesville. The way forward with
this concept must be to go back and address the past failure. That means
more discussion about “No Enemies On The Right” with the aim of getting
it right.
