No one knows when slavery started, but it seems to have been a part of
human civilization from the start. There is evidence of slavery in the
earliest civilizations along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in
Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus Valley in India, and China’s
Yangtze River Valley. This suggests slavery was integral to the
establishment of large-scale settlements.

Slavery was the norm in the world until European Protestants decided it
was immoral and began to ban it. Until the Protestant nations of Europe
rose to power, slavery was tolerated by Christians. The Catholic Church
opposed the treatment of African slaves in the New World but was not
opposed to slavery. It was the Protestants who went the next step and
demanded the end of slavery.

Of course, slavery was not what modern people imagine. Slaves often had
rights and there were rules for how slaves must be treated. The very
first law codes were created to deal with the treatment of slaves. This
makes sense since if there are a lot of slaves, there is the risk of a
slave revolt, so keeping the slave classes happy was always going to be
a primary consideration for society.

This was true in the American South. Contrary to the nonsense version of
history taught in schools and popularized through movies and television,
the African slaves in North America were treated well. They were
valuable property, one of the most lucrative investments in the New
World, so slave owners took care of them. A happy slave was a productive
and profitable slave.

In fact, slaves were much more productive than the freemen. Contrary to
the cartoon version of history, the plantation owners cared more about
their slaves than the white workers on the plantation. One reason for
that is slavery as a form of labor was much more productive than paid
labor. The slave owner was more likely to have a hired man whipped than
to whip one of his slaves.

That is the show this week. It is about the economic reality of slavery
in the South leading up to the Civil War. The source for this
information is an old book titled, *Time on the Cross: The Economics of
American Negro Slavery* by the economists Robert Fogel and Stanley L.
Engerman. It is a great work of revisionist history, a skill that we
will need to hone, given that our official history is mostly nonsense.
