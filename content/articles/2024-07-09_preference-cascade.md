The regime media’s ongoing meltdown over Joe Biden’s mental decline
might be a bit of foreshadowing for what lies ahead in American society.
What was on display the night of the debate is called a preference
cascade. This is when people suddenly realize that their private doubts
or preferences are shared by everyone else. One person realizes he is
not alone in his doubts, for example, so he voices them and all of a
sudden, this private doubt sweeps the room as public doubt.

Up to that point, everyone privately assumed that everyone else held an
opinion or preference that was contrary to their private opinion or
preference. This is preference falsification, which involves the
selection of a publicly expressed preference that differs from the
privately held preference of the person. The person may disagree with
what she perceives to be the collective opinion but she keeps this
private. This is the underlying condition for the preference cascade.

Regarding Biden and the media, they were seeing what the world has been
seeing for years, but they chose to keep quiet about it. One reason is
pressure from the top of the media operations who collude with the
political elites. The bigger reason is the herd mentality of regime
media. The thing these people fear most is to be expelled from the
system, so they invest most of their energy in making sure they never
wander too far away from the rest of the herd.

On the night of the debate, as Biden stared into nothingness with his
mouth open like a nursing home patient, the conflict between the
privately held opinion of Biden’s condition and official opinion grew so
large some people snapped. This is what set off the chain reaction we
saw that night. All of a sudden, the poles have reversed and those who
doubt that it is a good idea to question Biden’s fitness keep quiet
because they assume the herd holds a contrary opinion.

This is creating an enormous problem for Team Biden. They are going from
one regime platform to the next hoping to pressure these people into
abandoning the public position on Biden’s brain condition, but that same
herd mentality is preventing them from changing opinions on the matter.
They are now playing the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/09/today-could-be-really-good-biden-or-really-bad/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">race card</a> against regime media, with
the Congressional Black Caucus leading the charge. Questioning Biden’s
fitness is now the new racism.

What the regime is slamming into is a problem of their own making.
Decades of lies about the nature of the regime were made possible by
manipulation of the public through the herd mentality of regime media.
Note how the regime worked tirelessly to remove anyone from the media
who questioned official narratives. The purge of diverse opinion from
Fox News is the most recent example. The regime built a herd and now the
herd has broken through the fence.

This may turn out to be a good analogy for society as a whole. The
two-party system that emerged from the Cold War was built around a new
consensus. The end of history was the triumph of Western democracy and
by extension, the triumph of the managerial elite that came to control
Western democracies. One party would promote a domestic agenda
shepherded by the elites, while the other party would champion an
international agenda that spread that domestic agenda globally.

The glue holding it together was both their confidence in their ability
to remake the world, but also their shared belief that the general
public was fully committed to what the elites now call democracy. For
thirty years the public has been subjected to a firehose of propaganda
about how “our democracy” works. You have to accept the results because
it is the result of democracy and no one better question “our democracy”
or you are worse than Hitler.

The truth is though, this process and slowly undermined public trust in
the institutions associated with democracy. Only kooks and simpletons
accept anything from regime media at face value. Most people think the
political parties are corrupt. If not for Trump, the Republican Party
would be facing the same fate as the Tories. Even the military has lost
the trust of the public. Recruitment is in a crisis because the people
who used to buy the flag waving no longer wave the flags of their
fathers.

In other words, we have a condition similar to that which prevailed in
the media with regards to Biden’s mental health. The gap between what
people think privately about their political system and what they will
state publicly is growing. Every fake news item about it, each dodgy
election result and the increasing despair at daily life are widening
that gap by undermining trust in the system. The conditions for a
preference cascade are just about in place, waiting for the match.

Wild fires start because no one can easily predict which spark at which
location will set the woods ablaze. The solution is to prevent the
conditions that can lead to a wildfire, rather than police the sparks.
The regime has chosen the other path. They invest their time in
preventing sparks. The reason regime media looks like a zombie horde is
anyone with a spark of curiosity was forced to hide his own misgivings
for fear of being ostracized, but that just created the conditions for
this media wildfire.

We see the same in the general public. In the fullness of time, we may
look at this ongoing populist revolt as a genuine defense of the system
by the public because they still believed in the system. The real
peasant revolt that comes next will start with the preference cascade
when everyone all at once realizes that everyone else detests their
rulers and the system that makes them possible. History says these sorts
of wildfires end only <a
