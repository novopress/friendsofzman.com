I did not cover it in the show because the story dropped overnight, but
it looks like the <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/musk-threatens-walk-away-twitter-deal"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Musk-Twitter deal</a> is in trouble. The
stated reason is Musk thinks Twitter has been faking their user numbers.
Twitter admitted initially that 5% of their users were robots, but that
always seemed like a lie. There are too many blue check journalists with
high user counts and low traffic volume. The likes to replies is also
out of order.

Years ago, a British research team estimated that Twitter controlled a
bot army of about six hundred thousand Twitter accounts. They could use
this swarm to boost favored users and rig the trending topics. Others
have made similar claims about fake users and not just about Twitter.
This [video](https://youtu.be/oVfHeWTKjag) is from almost ten years ago
and it walks through how Facebook fakes its own ad traffic.

There is an age old expression that says anything of value will be
stolen or faked and that surely applies to internet traffic. In the old
days, magazines and newspapers were subject to audits so they could not
lie about their subscriber base and sales to prospective advertisers.
The ratings book in radio was about protecting the advertisers from
fraudulent claims about the listenership.

There has never been anything like this for social media companies or
internet news sites, so fraud is rampant. The question is how rampant.
Years ago, Ann Coulter tweeted out a
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=18207" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> from this site. This was a test to see how much
traffic actually would come from Twitter. A grand total of seven hundred
clicks was the final result. Coulter supposedly has two million
followers.

It is hard to know if what Musk is doing is legitimate or simply a way
to wiggle out of what may be a bad deal. Everyone agrees he overpaid for
the company and everyone agrees that the deal has only gotten worse. His
claims about the user base could be a way to scuttle the deal entirely.
Alternatively, he could be greenmailing Twitter into agreeing to much
lower price for the company.

Regardless, it is certain that Twitter has been lying about their user
base for a long time and the degree of overstatement is much higher than
they have admitted. This is probably true of every site whose traffic is
tied to revenue. The temptation to lie is simply too great and the
morality of the people involved is too low. So much of Big Tech is a big
fraud and it starts with fake traffic numbers.
