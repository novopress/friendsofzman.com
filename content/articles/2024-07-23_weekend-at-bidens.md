Going back to when the regime selected Joe Biden to “win” the Democratic
primary and then “win” the general election, there have been jokes about
his health, making references to the movie *Weekend At Bernie’s*. Just
about every way to call someone a corpse has been used to describe Joe
Biden. In what could be final proof that we do live in a simulation, Joe
Biden is now hiding out, incommunicado, at his beach house in Delaware,
supposedly suffering from Covid.

Now, he is not entirely cut off from the world. He supposedly wrote that
letter, a scan of which was posted on Twitter, now stupidly called X, in
which he bowed out of the presidential race. Someone who sort of sounded
like Biden supposedly “called” the Harris campaign to pledge support.
Amusingly or alarmingly, depending upon your point of view, Harris
flubbed her lines and started to say it was a recording, but then caught
herself and played along until the end.

Now, the letter Biden allegedly wrote is a huge problem for a number of
reasons, not the least of which is we have no idea who wrote it. The
official version is his longtime friend “helped” him write it, but then
why was it not on White House letterhead or even the letterhead of the
campaign? Why does the signature look like it was written by another
person or possibly generated using Microsoft Paint? Resigning by scanned
letter posted on social media is also bizarre.

What the letter suggests is that Biden is either dead or in a coma or
maybe in and out of it mentally, so people around him wrote the letter
to distract people. If they had not posted this letter on Sunday, there
would be media camped out in Delaware doing what they have been told to
do, which is hound Biden out of the race. The letter was to shift the
focus from Biden onto Harris. The trouble is, everyone in Washington
seems to understand this so they started calling for proof of life.

That explains the bizarre show they put on yesterday. The whole thing
looked like a poorly done high school play. Of course, faking a voice is
now quite simple thanks to the explosion of cheap software tools.
Someone with free time was able to make this
<a href="https://gab.com/TheZBlog/posts/112827390826625943"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> that looks fairly good but
sounds even better. A professional with the right equipment would be
able to create a fake Joe Biden recording that would fool even his
family, so it is well within the realm of the possible.

In fact, all of this fakery is well within the realm of the
parsimonious. A good rule of life is that people who have lied to you
everyday up to this point are probably lying to you now and will
continue to lie to you in the future. Everything about the Biden
campaign, presidency and re-election campaign has been a lie, so it is
wise to assume that what is happening with him right now is a lie too.
What we can assume at this point is the official version of events is
false.

Of course, the counter to this is why would they do this? The whole
point of the lies to this point was to keep him in the race so the
vote-rigging machine could get him re-elected and his team could carry
on for another term. If he is unable to fill that duty, then why not
finish him off and rally around Harris? It is not as if she is a genius
who will outwit these people and install her own regime. Even in his
vegetative state, Joe Biden is smarter than Kamala Harris.

Therein lies the mystery. One clue to all of this is that Harris was
never part of the Obama crime family. When she ran in 2020, her <a
href="https://observer.com/2017/07/clinton-staff-donors-kamala-harris-2020/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">staff</a> was composed of former Clinton
people, not Obama people. Amusingly, it is just assumed that because she
is not white that she is in the Obama crime family. This is not the case
at all, and it is why the Biden people dunked on her to the media.
Putting Harris in the White House would be bad for the Biden-Obama
people who are running things.

That raises another question. Why are the people around the dead or
comatose Biden saying he endorses Harris? One reason is it would look
even weirder than any of this stuff looks if he did not endorse her.
That and an open primary could result in violent street battles in
Chicago. Both parties remain haunted by the 1968 Democratic convention
in Chicago, but especially the Democrats. Even a mild version of that
would sink the party up and down the ticket.

The other reason is that there seems to be a consensus that Harris is
simply too stupid and obnoxious to win. From the perspective of the
Obama crime family, Harris running a shabby campaign and losing to
Orange Hitler would put an end to the Clinton crime family as a viable
force in Washington. In another of life’s amusing ironies, the Clinton
wing is now seen as the old white leadership, while the Obama wing is
the new, diverse and ascendent leadership of the party.

The main problem with all of this is that at some point, Biden will have
to either make an appearance or be replaced by Harris for the remainder
of his term. At least that is what the normal rules would dictate. We
live in a bizarre age, so it is possible that the regime media simply
refuses to discuss the fact that the president has not been seen for
however long it takes to pull off this caper. They are not all that
curious at the moment when the topic is at the center of the public
stage.

It is an example of the lack of second order thinking. The people around
Biden are like conmen who lie to get out of a jam, but each lie creates
a new jam, for which they have to come up with another lie. The result
is they get carried along by their river of lies without any concept of
where it leads. That has been the history of the Biden presidency thus
far. In this case, they cannot figure out what lie to tell now, so they
remain under the cone of silence.

What we know now is Biden is either too dead or too sick to <a
href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/us-news/netanyahu-meeting-with-biden-scrapped-as-president-recovers-from-covid-reports/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">meet</a> with the Lizard King’s chief
emissary on earth. If he cannot make that meeting, then it is safe to
assume he is too sick or dead to do much of anything. This raises the
obvious question of who is making decisions in his name. You can get
away with this for a week, but any longer than that is too absurd even
in our clown times. Sometime soon, Biden must make an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXhfv4UYv2I" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">appearance</a> or step down from office.
