The week after the New Year week is always a weird one. In the dreaded
private sector, people are busy catching up on what they did not get
done over the holidays. Closing the books for the year and getting ready
for the coming year keeps people busy. For the political class, it is a
time for extra partying, as newly minted pols arrive and the old
politicians return to the Imperial Capital. The media is busy being
instructed on how to lie to the public in the coming year. The result is
a slow week or two in January.

I thought about doing an immigration show or maybe a shutdown show,
given that Trump had his big speech on Tuesday. The speech was a bit of
a flop, as far as I could tell. I looked at some twitter feeds of
immigration patriots and they were not impressed. On the other hand,
everyone was horrified by the image of Chuck and Nancy. They looked like
weird lizard people from another planet. The more the public sees those
two, the better it is for Trump in this fight. He should get them on TV
daily.

Anyway, I went in another direction, looking for stuff that was not
terribly political, at least related to current events. I do start with
a segment on Tucker’s great monologue from the start of the year, which
made so-called conservatives very sad this week. I think in the fullness
of time, we will see this as a turning point of sorts. It is a time for
choosing among the so-called conservatives and libertarians. They can
either join team anti-white or join team white. The days of ignoring
this reality of dwindling.
