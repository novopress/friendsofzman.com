Someone posted in the comments a link to an Ed Dutton <a
href="https://vdare.com/articles/andrew-tate-is-he-a-symptom-of-society-s-degeneration-into-warring-factions"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> at VDare that got me thinking
about a subject I touch on from time to time. That is, what kind of
society will be possible with the history and human capital that will be
available to us in the glorious time after this age? Whatever it is will
not be like what was done in the past, simply because the material will
be vastly different.

All discourse on what passes for the Right tends toward some version of
“all we need to do is return to…” What ends the sentence is an idealized
version of one of the big three ideologies of the past. Alternatively,
people will offer up a vision of the future without mentioning how we
get there from here. White nationalism, for example, suffers from the
same problem as libertarianism. It exists only as an idea.

This is a problem with politics that we inherited from the
Enlightenment, which is to assume you can start with a clean sheet of
paper when it comes to politics. In every other area of life, problem
solving begins with an assessment of the material at hand and the
minimum requirements of the project. This is, in fact, how human society
evolves, despite the claims of political philosophy.

This means that the place to start when thinking about the politics of
the future is the material that will be available in the future. If the
Western order does crumble, as it seems to be doing, then the question
is not what will replace the current system but what can replace it.
That means taking stock of what the population will look like
demographically and spiritually.
