We are running out of road for 2020 and it is fair to assume that most
people will be happy to close the books on a very bad year. The thing is
though, it is not unrealistic to think that maybe we will one day soon
look back on 2020 with fondness. There are a lot of very dark clouds on
the horizon. The collection of buffoons The Pretender is assembling
promises more mayhem in 2021. He has avoided nominating a tranny, but
otherwise it is a list of time serving party hacks.

No one discusses it, but there are some very bad things happening in the
economy and with more Covid restrictions this winter, next year could be
grim. [The masters of the universe](https://youtu.be/tXWzOMgUoxk) are
forging ahead with their plans to build back better, but that mostly
means the rest of us get poorer. Roughly half of small business is
described as in crisis, meaning close to failure. Throw in the mandatory
vaccines, the new tracking efforts and 2021 could turn out to be a lot
worse than 2020.

There’s also the Trump factor. The man who went to Washington and broke
a lot of things is now headed back to regular life to break a lot of
things. It is unlikely that he stays quiet in retirement, which means he
will be looking for an audience. All of those people who have been
rallying against the election fraud will probably be his first target
once he is out of office. Trump loved doing rallies, so we can expect
the MAGA rally to be a feature of 2021, whether we like it or not.

It is also clear that The Pretender will be faced with a revolt from the
Left, as the army of the woke is already making trouble. Ocasio-Cortez
smells blood, looking at the collection of geezers leading her party.
Our side jokes about them putting a pillow of Biden’s face after the
inauguration, but the Left expects it to happen. They were promised a
colored revolution and they are not getting it. Putting that genie back
in the bottle may not be as easy as the Democrats assumed.

The point is that we are about to turn the page on the craziest year
anyone can remember, but the next page could be even worse. It is sure
to be different, now that Trump has been removed from office. The people
in charge assume it will get back to normal, but that is not happening.
Joe Biden may have no trouble forgetting 2020 and the Trump era, but the
rest of us will not forget. It will inform our actions and that means it
will cast a shadow over the next chapter of decline.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
