Last week brought news that the iconic restaurant chain Red Lobster has
filed for bankruptcy protection and has started closing locations. The
chain is mostly known for being a cheap night out for people in the
suburbs and businessmen stuck near a suburban business park. The people
hired to write about business for regime media, people who know nothing
about business, have
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/20/red-lobster-bankruptcy-filed"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">rolled</a> with the usual lines about how
casual dining was devastated by the pandemic.

The joke online is that Red Lobster’s all you can eat shrimp deal cost
them millions because diversity would sit there for hours eating shrimp.
The restaurant admits it was a disaster for them, but the real reason
the chain has failed is that it was taken over by gangsters who made it
into a bust-out. The gangsters in this case are private equity investors
who bought up the chain. This bankruptcy is part of fleecing the dumb
money that still remains trapped in the enterprise.

The way these scams work is the private investors swoop in and buy a
property that is asset rich but cash poor. That is, they have things of
value, but those things are not generating enough revenue to meet
expenses. Sometimes the enterprise is profitable but needs cash to
expand or maybe reorganize itself to shed poorly performing assets and
expand into more profitable areas. Private equity comes in with
attractive terms and an army of experts to reshape the enterprise.

In reality, they usually sell the assets in deals that have the buyer
lease back the asset to the company in order to raise quick cash. Other
times the asset is pledged as collateral in a similar sort of debt
arrangement. The result is the enterprise quickly raises cash to pay the
investors with a healthy profit but is left stripped of its assets and
often holding a lot of debt. This is what happened here. The new
investors sold the real estate in lease-back deals that are now
expiring.

It is a good example of how so much of our economic output is just
moving money around in circles. It is the old
<a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/01/an_answer_to_a.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke</a> about a stranger coming into a
little town to rent a room for the night. Nothing of value has been
created by investors buying up this restaurant chain. It simply became a
vehicle for them to lure in new money to pay them a profit for their
investment, while all along knowing that the end result would be these
new investors getting a haircut in bankruptcy proceedings.

The argument in favor of this sort of dealing is that all of the parties
involved are sophisticated enough to know the risks. The real estate
investors that bought the properties and then leased them back knew the
risks or at least they should have known the risks, as it is their
business to know the risks. This is all true, but it obscures the fact
that this is not genuine economic activity. This is not how an economy
should function, but it is the core of the American economy now.

This is not without consequences. Travelers now have to check out the
type of plane they could be boarding, because Boeing planes are falling
apart. As with Red Lobster, the <a
href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/insider-explains-what-has-gone-wrong-with-boeing"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">blame</a> is placed on diversity, which
is not entirely without merit, but the real culprit is the vulture
capitalism that has come to define elite economics. Boeing is no longer
in the business of building better airplanes. It is in the business of
creating financial transactions for the benefit of the investor class.

What we see with Boeing has been happening with the military industrial
complex for the last three decades. They are no longer in the business
of building practical weapons that can be used by the American military.
Instead, they are in the business of creating complex transactions for
the benefit of insiders and investors. One result is an F-35 fleet that
looks great <a
href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/05/16/lockheed-running-out-of-parking-space-amid-f-35-delays-says-watchdog/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">parked</a> at an air field, but it is too
dangerous to fly. Meanwhile, Russia and China make weapons for war, not
investor profit.

A root of this growing problem in the American economy is the notion
that anything that can be shown to turn a profit is normatively good.
The usual suspects are going to ruin the town of Harpers Ferry with a <a
href="https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2023/01/06/hill-top-house-hotel-harpers-ferry-wv-fight/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">development project</a> that will make
them money, but come at the expense of the residents. They can do this
because they went to the state and showed it will turn a profit, so
everyone fell in line. No doubt promises of insider access to those
profits were included in the pitch.

The reason profit is a good thing in an economy is it is supposed to
spur innovation that results in new products and greater efficiency.
Profit is a means to an end, not an end in itself from a macroeconomic
perspective. When profit or the quest for profit results in planes
falling from the sky or communities being harvested for their social
capital, then profit or the quest for profit is bad for society. It is
why we used to hunt down and punish corruption and fraud. Note we no
longer do that.

An economy is about making things, fixing things, and inventing things,
which is no longer the way to get rich in America. Instead, as Peter
Theil explained in his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>, the path to wealth is finding a
way to game the system. You find a flim-flam like the Red Lobster scam
or you game government to let you <a
href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/electric-vehicles-direct-wealth-transfer-owners-gas-powered-vehicles-ev-owners-experts"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">make</a> electric cars that no one needs
or wants. The blood sucker economy is not about making things, fixing
things, and inventing things. It is about robbing the people who do
those things.
