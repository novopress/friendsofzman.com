After a week of stellar posting inspired by a trip to American
Renaissance, I thought a show on generational stuff would be a good way
to finish the week. It is also a good show to do before a summer
vacation. With two weeks left of summer, I am going to take the next two
weeks off from the show. I have some things that I want to get done
before the fall, so it means making some time in the schedule.

The post earlier in the week about the Zoomers and specifically the
Fuentes cult got me thinking about other issues related to generational
topics. Something I did not mention in my show is the fact that the
Zoomers are about to be elbowed off the stage in the next year or two by
Generation Alpha. I am told this is the label for the kids who are
currently in high school at the moment.

It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at the thought of Fuentes
and his crew suddenly finding themselves as geezers in pop culture
terms. I look forward to the Alphas calling him a Zoomer-Boomer as a way
to indicate he is an old man while they are the young happening future.
Maybe we also get an Alpha version of the groypers turning up in comment
sections to heckle the Zoomers.

Putting that aside, the Alphas will be the first diverse generation.
They will be majority-minority, so the media will love them. The face of
this generation will be a trans lesbian of color immigrant transvestite.
Nothing screams the glorious future like a young mentally unstable
genetic dead end. Maybe they should be called Omegas, as they may be the
last generation for the circus known as America.
