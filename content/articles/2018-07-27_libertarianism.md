From time to time I get serious queries about my views on
libertarianism. I take a backseat to no man in my disdain for modern
libertarians, so I think a lot of people just assume I have never
bothered to fully understand the topic. This is a popular defense from
libertarians and soccer enthusiasts. As with soccer, the primary appeal
of libertarianism is its simplicity, so this line of defense is a bit
silly. Still, I thought a fuller explanation of my views on the topic
would make for an interesting show this week, so here we are.

Now, as we see with defenders of Islam, libertarians have a habit of
strapping on roller skates whenever you begin to analyze their thing.
“That’s not the real Islam” follows every terrorist attack. “That’s not
the real libertarianism” will inevitably show up in the comments of this
podcast. I chose to rely on Hans-Hermann Hoppe for this show, as he is
the pope of the faith right now. I did draw on Rothbard a bit and Rand,
of course. I largely ignored the childish scribbling from Reason \[clown
horn\] and Cato.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
