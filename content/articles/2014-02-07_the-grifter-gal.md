The food supply in the West is surprisingly safe, given the deregulated
and decentralized nature of the system of producing food and getting it
to your table. This reality, however, comes with frequent food scares.
These cares are usually based in superstitious nonsense. Every day we
see stories about how some staple of our diet is dangerous or a story
debunking the previous scary story. Then there are the new snake oil
salesman, pitching the latest food fads and miracle diets.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> about Subway is
a good example. The chemical in this case is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azodicarbonamide"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Azodicarbonamide</a>, a food
stabilizer. There’s no science linking it to any negative health issues.
We know this because it is in all of the food in North America and
people are not falling over dead from it. Granted, there has not been a
longitudinal study on the widespread use of it, but the lack of people
dying from it is called a clue. That does not stop grifters from
claiming otherwise. In this case, it is someone named
<a href="https://foodbabe.com/team/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Vani Hari</a>.

*Vani started FoodBabe.com in April 2011 to spread information about
what is really in the American food supply. She teaches people how to
make the right purchasing decisions at the grocery store, how to live an
organic lifestyle, and how to travel healthfully around the world. The
success in her writing and investigative work can be seen in the way
food companies react to her uncanny ability to find and expose the
truth.*

Where she got the knowledge she spreads is a mystery. A search for a
more detailed biography comes up empty. It appears she was a marketing
or sales person out of college and then got into the fake nutrition
rackets. That’s not surprising. People in sales are good at finding the
pressure points of people and exploiting them. So are con-artists, which
is the entire population of the health food racket. Everyone wants to be
healthy and will set aside rationality in the quest for good health. It
is a very old story.

A feature of the female grifter these days is the weird aspirational way
they describe themselves. Maybe is the way women have always talked, but
men never had a reason to notice it. In this highly feminized culture,
women are turning up everywhere in female lead roles, which are
exaggerated versions of women. That means they talk about themselves in
weird ways and seem to care about everything a bit too much.

*My name Vani, means Voice in my native language, and I have always had
things to “Voice” throughout my life whether it be about politics, the
environment or whatever is making headlines. After suffering some
serious health issues, I became incredibly passionate about
understanding what is in food – how it is grown, what chemicals are used
in its production, and what eating food does or doesn’t do for the
body.*

Hitler became *passionate* about killing Jews and Slavs. Mao, after
coming to power, became *passionate* about killing off millions of his
people. Pol Pot was very passionate about his work. Serial killers are
passionate about their work. When the West was run by sensible men,
taming one’s passions was a virtue. Now that it is run by women, the
more passion the better, even if the person is a raving lunatic and con
artist. Perhaps that’s the other feature of girl power. Everyone becomes
a con artist.
