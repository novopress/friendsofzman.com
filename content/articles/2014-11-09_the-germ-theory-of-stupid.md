The evolutionary biologist Greg Cochran suggested that homosexuality may
be the result of an unknown pathogen. The idea that pathogens could be
the root cause of things like heart disease and insanity has been
kicking around for a while. Like a lot of speculative science, there’s
no money in it until someone finds something concrete and then there’s
the politics There’s funding available for genetic research. There’s no
money for locating the gay germ.

A virus that infects human brains and makes us more stupid has been
discovered, according to scientists in the US.

The algae virus, never before observed in healthy people, was found to
affect cognitive functions including visual processing and spatial
awareness.

Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the University of
Nebraska stumbled upon the discovery when they were undertaking an
unrelated study into throat microbes.

Surprisingly, the researchers found DNA in the throats of healthy
individuals that matched the DNA of a virus known to infect green algae.

Dr Robert Yolken, a virologist who led the original study, said: “This
is a striking example showing that the ‘innocuous’ microorganisms we
carry can affect behaviour and cognition.

“Many physiological differences between person A and person B are
encoded in the set of genes each inherits from parents, yet some of
these differences are fuelled by the various microorganisms we harbour
and the way they interact with our genes.”

Of the 90 participants in the study, 40 tested positive for the algae
virus. Those who tested positive performed worse on tests designed to
measure the speed and accuracy of visual processing. They also achieved
lower scores in tasks designed to measure attention.

Humans’ bodies contain trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Most
are harmless, but the findings of this research show that there some
microbes can have a detrimental impact on cognitive functions, while
leaving individuals healthy.

The study’s findings were published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.

I like how 40 of 90 tested positive for stupidism. At first blush is
seems like a blow to the IQ uber alles guys because we have a pretty
solid example of environmental factors altering IQ. That would support
the argument that improved environment (no stupid germs) will improve
IQ. It also means that maybe the Flynn Effect is just the result of
better hygiene, not better school. Just as better food supplied results
in taller humans, better hygiene results in smarter humans. That would,
of course, support many of the claims from the HBD crowd regarding IQ.

I would be curious about the race of the participants. If it turned out
that the 40 were all from a certain place I think I would blow a funny
fuse.
