One of the things you can count on, one of the universal constants of
American politics, is the Republicans will always find a way to save the
Democrats from whatever mess they have created for themselves. It is the
reason the Republican party exists. They are the guys at the back of the
circus parade with shovels. They scoop up what gets plopped onto the
streets by the Left. The main job of the GOP is making sure the suckers
in the suburbs never lose faith in the system.

We have an example of how this works with the Build Back Better scheme
the Democrats have been working on for six months. They don’t have the
votes to pass it on their own under the normal procedures and many of
their own members are worried that it will make them unemployed. Not
everyone in plutocracy is onboard with the Great Break the radicals have
planned. Therefore some Democratic pols have been instructed by their
owners to oppose it.

The squabbling between the far-left crazies, close to half the House
Democratic caucus at this point, and the slightly-less-crazy members has
resulted in a deadlock. The Inner Party cannot find a way to get
agreement on passing the Build Back Better bill or agreement on kicking
it down the road. Worse yet, they have to raise the debt limit to avoid
a government shutdown. They either need the Republicans to help them
raise the debt ceiling or they need a deal with the crazies.

Just as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, [here
comes](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/manchin-digs-wont-budge-15-trillion-top-line-reiterates-opposition-filibuster-carve-out)
the Republican Party to the rescue, offering to help them raise the debt
ceiling. You see, it is against conservative principles to let the
government shutdown, so the Republicans will graciously give the other
side all the time they need to hammer out their great restructuring of
American society. They are waving this around as a victory, claiming
they owned the libs or some such nonsense.

Now, none of this matters all that much as the Republican Party is just
an ornament to decorate the system. They have no power and no desire to
exercise power even if permitted to wield it. That should have been made
clear during the Bush years when they had control of both houses and the
White House for six years. Instead of doing anything they promised for
generations, they did the exact opposite. It was the least
“conservative” period since the Johnson administration.

Of course, the Obama years and the Trump years should have made clear to
even the dumbest white person on the municipal golf course that voting
for the Republicans is a statement against interest. The party got the
majority in the House after 2010 and remained rolled up in a ball until
Obama left town. When Trump arrived, they sprang into action to block
his every move. Then they threw the 2018 House elections to make sure
the Trump administration got nothing done.

That is the good news about the current circus in Washington. No one
seems to care all that much other than the crazies on the Left. Trump is
holding rallies and people are attending, but he is not talking about
the circus in DC. The <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/10/democrats-perplexing-political-miscalculation/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">mouth-breathers</a> in Conservative Inc.
have tried to get people interested in this issue, but the rest homes
have been quiet. It looks like Covid has wiped out most of their
supporters, those unwilling to wake up to the reality of the racket.

Even regime media is struggling to pretend this is interesting. They
can’t figure out how to attack the freaky left-wing Senator from
Arizona, who is one of the senators holding up the works. Kyrsten Sinema
(D-AZ) ticks many identity boxes, so they have to tread lightly with
her. Joe Manchin is just a Republican playing Democrat, so they can’t do
anything with him either. The fact is, the regime media is overrun with
kooks now, so they are not very good at selling the party message.

Prior stand-offs over the debt ceiling and the budget have been big
news, but this one has no interest, suggesting that there has been a
change in sentiment. One possible reason for that is many normal people
are now fully aware that they had been throwing their vote away on
Republicans. They may hate Biden and chant his name at public events,
but they are no longer Republican by default. They will support Trump as
a symbol of their team, but that is as far as it goes.

That could be good news. On the other hand, the lack of media hype about
this fight in Washington could be a sign the system is fully aware. That
is, they now realize they can operate in spite of public opinion. People
who gladly went along with bizarre mandates like mask wearing and
accepted the 2020 election are not going to be fertilizing the tree of
liberty anytime soon. If you have an unlimited supply of imaginary
voters and no one cares, then why pretend public opinion matters?

Both things can be true at the same time, so that may be what we are
seeing with this edition of the political drama. The old Red Team – Blue
Team politics of the last thirty years has finally run out of road. What
replaces it remains to be seen, but watching octogenarians play a
pointless game of legislative chess is no longer what engages the
general public. The supporters of Red Team may have finally wised up and
the supporters of Blue Team just want their stuff.

Either way, it is a probably good sign. The best thing that could happen
for normal Americans is that the Republican Party dissolved. Once the
fight is purely “us and them” with the latter part being the people
running the system, regardless of label, then a genuine politics is
possible. As long as normal people have the escape hatch of compromise,
they will always take it. If the disinterest in this is the prelude to
disillusionment, then things can get interesting again.
