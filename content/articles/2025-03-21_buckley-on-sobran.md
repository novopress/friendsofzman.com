Joe Sobran is arguably the first person hurled into the void in a
process that eventually was called cancel culture. His primary sins were
skepticism about Israel as our greatest ally and suspicions about the
motivations of the neocons. It was the neocons who successfully
campaigned to have Sobran branded a heretic and run out of the
conservative movement.

Looking back four decades on, you see all the ingredients for what
became a widespread form of domestic terrorism in the last decade.
Interestingly, all of it is in what Bill Buckley thought was his [best
book](https://www.amazon.com/Search-Anti-Semitism-William-F-Buckley/dp/082640619X).
It is a collection of his essays on the topic of antisemitism, as well
as his famous finking on friends like Joe Sobran and Pat Buchanan at the
request of his new benefactors.

Reading Buckley’s version of the Sobran affair, what comes through is
that all politics in a democracy are theater. Buckley felt he had to
debase himself, his friends and even his own family in order to remain
on the stage. The reason for that is the stage managers had an agenda
that agenda was anathema to the human spirit and traditions conservatism
allegedly represented.

In the show I take a much tougher tone with Buckley, but upon reflection
I do not think he was a soulless political operator. Even though he
treated Joe Sobran horribly, Sobran [thought
well](http://www.sobran.com/columns/2006/060530.shtml) of Bill Buckley
until the end. It is a good reminder that you can think well of someone
in the whole, even though they have done you wrong, in your view, over a
particular issue. Even the best men have terrible flaws.

All that said, it was Buckley’s decision to cancel Sobran that gave us
this now familiar model for controlling the public square. Even today,
public officials feel they must publicly swear loyalty to Israel for
fear of being cancelled. This noxious effluvium even hangs over the
tribe we call the left. The great terror that haunts public discourse
got started with Buckley hurling Joe Sobran into the void.
