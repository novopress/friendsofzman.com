With the infuriating madness going on in politics, I thought it was a
good idea to take a look at the general madness that is the current age.
It really is remarkable just how crazy things have gotten in a short
period of time. The other day I was picking around YouTube, watching
some old clips from 1970’s shows and I was struck by how strange and
alien it all seems. Even though I was alive then, I was too young to
notice what was happening in the world, so to my old eyes, it looks like
another country, because it is another country.

Even in my adult life, things have changed so fast that my teenage years
now feel like the past of different person from a different world. When
I was in high school, no human walking the earth thought teenagers
fumbling around in the dark was anything but normal, as long as it was a
boy and a girl, of course. Today, it is grounds to destroy a man’s life,
humiliate his family and maybe even warrant physical harm. The Anita
Hill travesty looks quite innocent now, compared to the disgusting
displays we saw this week.

More worrisome, the madness we see is almost exclusively a female
problem. The women of America have gone insane. Not all women, of
course, but a very large swath of them. Now, it is possible many are
just liars, taking advantage of the lunatics to gain attention, but that
seems worse to me. I think I’d prefer it if some women are simply
insane, infected by some unknown pathogen, rather than knowing that some
portion of our women are sociopaths. We are faced with nothing but bad
choices.

Anyway, this show is a sampling of the more popular forms of madness we
are witnessing today. Sadly, most of it is female madness. I guess the
last two segments could be argued as both male and female, but I don’t
see that as encouraging. The fact that male and female are close to
being forbidden concepts speaks to the madness of this age, more than
anything else, I think. Perhaps that is the real shame of it. The men
are no longer able to keep pace with the women in the race to the
asylum.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
