Lenin famously said there are decades in which nothing happens and then
there are weeks in which decades happen. That is the inspiration for the
show title and the show itself, which is a rundown of the events of the
last few weeks. Any of these events would probably qualify as a big deal
in isolation, especially the curious assassination attempt on Trump last
week.

The last few weeks culminating in one of the wildest conventions in a
long time has been an incredible ride, but we are just getting started.
The years long effort to keep Trump off that convention stage is not the
end of it. It is just the beginning of what lies ahead as the regime
never takes no for an answer. The ball is now back in their court, so
the next few weeks will make this last month seem normal.

The next chapter in this wild summer probably kicks off this weekend
with a renewed effort to push Biden aside. The fake news stories about
his imminent resignation were flying last night. It would take a heart
of stone to not laugh at the sight of regime members getting the fake
news treatment. Every story about Biden that contains “sources say” must
cut like a knife.

The thing to think about as we close the books on this chapter is that
none of the things that happened were predicted. Even the most
optimistic did not see the collapse of the court cases, for example.
Even the most dramatic did not imagine the events at that Trump rally
where he got the Van Gogh treatment. That means what comes next most
likely lies well outside our imagination. It is going to be wild.
