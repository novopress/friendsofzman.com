target="_blank">Karl Denninger</a> has been kicking around paleocon and
paleo-libertarian circles for a long time. He used to turn up on radio
programs hosted by old school paloes, but most of them have died off
now. Denninger is right about a lot of things, but he has a lot of weird
ideas too. You got the sense it takes a maximum effort to will himself
into a zone within striking distance of normal. At any moment, the
string could snap and he would spiral into lunacy.

<a href="http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=229297"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Example</a>.

*I’ve posted a handful of locked-comment Tickers lately (yes, I still do
add features once in a while to the software, and this is one of the
recent additions — the ability to pre-lock a submission so it’s
read-only.  Fancy that.) and have had a couple of people ask via an
invite-only BBM channel I set up “what’s dat.”*

The software he uses is awful. The comments appear way down the page, so
you would not know they exist if you did not scroll well past the post.
Denninger is terribly thin skinned so the comments are heavily regulated
and salted with his rantings about comments he does not like. His
obsessing over it is very weird. The fact that he has an invite-only
Blackberry channel is hilarious. It’s like grown men building a tree
house for his friends and no girls allowed.

The rest of the post has nothing to do with the first graph so maybe his
meds kicked in at that point. If you look at his
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Denninger"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bio on Wikipedia</a>, there is
a summary of his business career. Like Mark Cuban, Denninger got rich
from the free money era, without ever creating much of any value.
Further, his company could only exist because he got a government
contract. Now he is a retired guy ranting about the excesses of
government and the excesses of money creation.

Denninger would not be the first person driven mad by the realities and
contradictions of his own life. Denninger knows how government awards
contracts and he knows how fake money works. His insights, therefore,
are useful. On the other hand, it is hard to be a critic of those things
if you have befitted from them. It’s not impossible, but it requires a
mental discipline and degree of self-awareness that he clearly lacks.
