Here is my
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/watching-the-bums-fight/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a>. I have been doing a lot of
commentary on the various struggles within conservatism. Their struggle
is interesting as they are feeling around for an answer but first making
sure to avoid any of the right answers. It is a lot like how crime is
discussed in conservative media. They first make sure to remove all
reverences to race and then try to explain crime. The same thing happens
in these spats over how to revive the corpse of conservatism…

Here is a very <a href="https://geoworld.space/ukraine/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">useful map</a> of Ukraine. It shows the military
groupings, the various conflicts on the front and the important towns
and roads. Once you get the hand of the symbols and legends, you see
they the happy talk from the West with regards to the Ukrainian army is
nonsense. Like an amoeba surrounding and consuming one cell organisms,
the Russian army and local militias has broken up and is now consuming
the Ukrainian army operating in the Donbas.

The map also reveals the reckless stupidity of the Kiev regime. They
should have pulled out of the Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Those troops
cannot be supported and therefore have no way of surviving the Russian
advance. Instead they are left to be annihilated as another “heroic last
stand” publicity stunt. Thousands of Ukrainian lives have been lost so
that the west can own the Russians on Instagram, which should be a
special sort of war crime…

Happy Memorial Day!
