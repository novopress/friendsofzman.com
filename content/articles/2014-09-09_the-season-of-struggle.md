One of the more bizarre rituals on the Left is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">self-criticism session</a>.
The Chinese called them
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Struggle Sessions</a>. The
difference is probably cultural. Oriental societies have always
maintained a dense wall between the public life of a person and the
interior life of a person. We have the word inscrutable for a reason.

Western culture has often, but not always, sought a strong link between
the public man and his private thoughts. In the West, “what you see is
what you get” makes a lot of sense for this reason. In China, such a
concept is hilariously alien. Still, the idea of confession as a
cleanser is a universal.

The NBA is going through that now. Donald Sterling’s threat to dish dirt
on the league has frightened them into a careful re-examination of their
private musings. Given how modern management works, the league office
probably instructed each team to scour their networks for any
communications that could be upsetting to blacks. Now we have a <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GM subjected to a struggle
session</a>. His crime was the same one tripping up everyone these days.
That would be noticing.

It was Charles Murray who documented that regulations tend to come along
after the threat had dissipated. In other words, once people became
aware of some danger they adjusted their behavior. It was only after
that government came along with rules intended to mitigate the danger.
Something similar is afoot here. It seems that most people are looking
at the public hysteria over these thought crimes and wondering if the
rulers have lost their minds.

Maybe these latent struggle sessions are a response to the public’s
dwindling interest in race or maybe it a foreshadowing of what lies
ahead for all of us. Unless you have brain damage, you can’t help but
notice that life for black Americans is pretty good. If you avoid crime,
drugs and mayhem, you will have a good life. You may not get rich, but
you can have a decent middle-class life. Most of the nation’s
celebrities are black. All of the athletes are black. They live like
royalty. Evidence of real discrimination is impossible to find without a
lot of digging and imagination.
