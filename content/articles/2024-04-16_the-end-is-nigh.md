Since it became clear during the 2016 election cycle that Conservative
Inc no longer had any influence on the Dirt People, there has been an
effort to reconstitute a New Right that will fill the void left by the
now Old Right. This being the mass media age, one part of that effort is
to promote certain online personalities as spokesmen for a particular
point of view. You see an example in this
<a href="https://im1776.com/2024/04/11/rufo-vs-yarvin/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">debate</a> organized by a site called IM1776, which is
“a magazine of cultural and sociopolitical analysis.”

It should be noted that IM1776 is the product of a not-for-profit called
The Art & Literature Foundation, which appears to be the brainchild of
an Italian guy named Mark Granza, who had his political awakening in
2016. You can read a lengthy interview of him in this English language
Hungarian <a
href="https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/interview/hungary_orban_conservatism_dreher_granza_interview_left_cancel_culture/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">site</a>. For the sake of clarity, IM1776
is financially <a href="https://im1776.claremont.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">supported</a> by Claremont. It is always wise to know
how someone pays his bills before assessing his political opinions.

That aside, what you see in this back and forth is the same specter that
has haunted Western political thought since 1789. That is the specter of
ideology. Both men are in their own way ideologues. They have an image
of how society ought to be organized based on how they think men ought
to act toward one another. While their ideal society is something of an
end point, it is, in fact, the starting point for them. In other words,
they begin with the end in mind.

For Curtis Yarvin, the end is a form of monarchy not because he thinks
it is the best in the abstract sense of the best society, but that only
through an absolute ruler can the things he likes about Western society
be defended from the dark forces that seek to unsettle our cultural
norms. Rufo, on the other hand, is a natural rights republican, who
thinks the ideal society is based in individual rights. It is only
through reaffirming our natural rights that we can restore the republic.

While there is a lot of overlap between what both see as the ideal
society, they clearly have different visions for how to achieve it.
Yarvin thinks we have to wait for the great man to emerge and topple the
present order. Alternatively, the present orders collapses, and a great
man emerges. Rufo thinks the way forward is to nibble away at the civil
rights order by attacking it fruits. His current project is to hold the
diversity hires in the academy to the alleged standards of the academy.

For most people this sounds logical. You start every project with the
end in mind and you see that is the Yarvin – Rufo debate. In fact, that
is the primary appeal of both Chris Rufo and Curtis Yarvin. They hold up
this image of a possible future and if you like what you see, you
support their program. This has been how political debate has been
framed in the West since the French Revolution. You are presented with
two images of the future and asked to pick one of them.

The problem with this, the reason that ideology must always fail, is
that it never considers if the end is possible or even plausible. This
is not because the ideologue is incapable of doubting the ideology. It
is because ideology must always rest on the assumption that all
societies are intentional societies. What we see is the product of human
labor, therefore the goodness or badness of society reflects the
goodness or badness of the people who made it.

Good people not only follow a certain code, but they must constitute the
telos of the society of which they are a part. No ideology ever
concludes that the ideologue must disengage with society, other than if
it helps him engage with fellow ideologues in plotting to overthrow the
present order. Ideology assumes you must be engage in the project of
moving society toward the desired end. Otherwise, you are assumed to be
working against those who are doing so.

To think that society is anything other than the fruit of human labor
would be a nullification of ideology. If society is the product or
random chance, for example, then what we ought to do to improve society
is meaningless. It makes no difference what we think we ought to do, as
the result is just a random walk. If what we see is the best we can
muster from the material at hand, then the ideal, what we ought to seek,
is actually a hindrance to creating a harmonious society.

As an aside, this explains the rejection of biological reality. The
popularity of the trans business is one way of denying biological
reality and the limits it must place on what is possible for human
society. The New Right rejects biology as it undermines their claims
about the nature of man. As soon as you accept biological reality, most
arguments about how we ought to live become superstition. You are left
with the question of what can we do with the material at hand.

Another thing you see with all of the participants in the New Right
project is that none of them are looking forward in the sense that some
novel vision of the future is leading them to question their own
assumptions of the past. Their prize is something like what the French
philosopher Jacques Derrida called hauntology. The New Right is
sentimental for a promised future that never materialized. It is why
they focus so much on the “wrong turns” of the past.

What all this leads to is the fact that we are seeing the end of
ideology. It is easy to forget, but ideology is a relatively novel thing
in the history of man. The Franks did not have a governing ideology. The
Greeks were not ideologues. Rameses did not govern with a vision of the
future in mind. For all of human history, how we ought to organize
society was a practical question, not a moral one. Ideology is an
invention of Western man, the weeds that grew out of the rubble of the
Thirty Years War.
