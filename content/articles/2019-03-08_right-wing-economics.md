Sometimes I sit down to write a post with an idea of what I want to say,
but a third of the way through I realize I’m going to make a different
point. For me, posting is really just a form of thinking out loud.
Sometimes that means taking what started writing, saving it for later
and starting over with my new set of thoughts in mind. More than a few
posts have gone this way, shattering into two or more posts.

This rarely happens with the podcast, because I actually do some prep
for it. I start on the weekend, thinking about a theme for the week.
I’ll then come up with ideas for each segment and then a outline those.
I don’t use a script, but that outline is like a set of notes for when I
record the segment. That way I don’t meander around too much and I don’t
forget the points I wanted to make. It’s not professional, but it works
for me.

This week, I got about halfway through I realized I should have done the
show different that I set out to do it. For example, I could probably do
a whole show on taxes from the classical right-wing perspective.
Distributionism really does need a whole show on it and I could probably
do a few shows on guys like de Maistre, Belloc and Chesterton. In other
words, the topic was too big for one hour, so it is way too superficial.

The trouble is, unlike a blog post, there is a point of no return with
these things. A typical blog post consumed 30 minutes of my time. The
podcast takes about ten hours to put together each week. There’s no
turning back once I get to recording, so I had to go with what I had
planned. It’s not cats singing Jingle Bells, but it is certainly one of
the topics that will get a do-over in the future. Maybe I’ll call it a
prequel.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
