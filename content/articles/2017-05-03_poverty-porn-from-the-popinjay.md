I make no bones about that fact I don’t like Kevin Williamson, the house
rumpswab at National Review. I have no tolerance for people who put on
false fronts and Williamson’s quill pen act is as phony as a three
dollar bill. George Will did the same thing for decades, but he at least
had a first class education and did some time as a university
instructor. He was a gold-plated phony, but at least he had some
credentials. Williamson has none of that. He’s just a real life version
of <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comic Book Guy</a> from the
Simpsons.

Gratuitously mocking fat guys is not a good look so I resist the
temptation by doing what most everyone does and that’s avoid reading
National Review. It’s not that hard as the only interesting thing about
conservative commentary these days is the remarkable dullness of it.
Even the most boring people are interesting on occasion. It takes
special talent to be that ineffectual all the time. So, I was minding my
own business scanning twitter and I see this tweet from Charles Murray:

It was in response to this tweet;

Naturally, I thought it was word that Williamson had got what he has
been publicly wishing on normal Americans for the last few years.
Instead it was more <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447292/underclass-character-eviction-court-native-born-americans-entrepreneurial-immigrants"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poverty porn</a> aimed at the
pseudo-academics, who populate think tanks and opinion sites in the
Imperial Capital. It’s becoming a specialty for Williamson. He writes up
a scene from lower class white America that portrays the people as
benighted losers, who deserve the abuse heaped upon them by the good
whites in his audience. It’s a ghetto tour as morality play.

The unconcealed contempt Williamson has for the subjects of his poverty
porn is both ugly and bizarre, given his alleged background. He has
invested a lot in creating a hillbilly back story for himself, which
suggests it is probably fictional or highly exaggerated. Even if it is
accurate, his contempt for the sorts of people he claims to have grown
up around as a kid is pathological. It suggests that Kevin Michael Grace
was right when he said in
<a href="http://2kevins.com/archives/1099" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">our chat</a> a few weeks back that Williamson is filled
with self-hatred.

Self-loathing fat guy is not an interesting area of inquiry. What is
interesting is the audience. Charles Murray pimping this stuff suggests
something about Murray and his view of the current crisis in American
culture. Murray is a libertarian and like all famous libertarians, he is
a ward of the state. AEI is a tax racket, like all of the so-called
think tanks. Murray also makes big money charging taxpayers between
$20,000 and $30,000 per speech at colleges and universities. That’s not
working class wages.

Similarly, Arthur Brooks is cashing in on the college speaking rackets.
<a
href="https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/celebritytalentbios/Arthur+C.+Brooks"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He also gets between $20,000
and $30,000 per speech</a>. Brooks also pays himself $700,000 per year
out of AEI, plus expenses, of course. He also gets $100,000 a year for
other work at AEI, but that’s not defined on
<a href="http://thezman.com/blogfiles/AEI2016.pdf"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the tax filing</a>. He may not
be a <a
href="http://www.investopedia.com/news/how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-percenter</a>, but he is
close enough to see it from his perch in the Imperial Capital. Being a
libertarian lion is a lot easier when you take home close to a million a
year from a tax exempt foundation.

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t begrudge these fat-cat grifters their money.
It’s a crooked and corrupt system and they are simply working it to
their advantage. I could do without the Randian lectures about small
government and rugged individualism, but hypocrisy is a feature of the
human condition, not a bug. What’s curious to me is why these people
seem to take pleasure in the suffering of the white lower classes. The
glee with which they praise these Williamson columns suggest they get
some strange pleasure from it.

That’s thing. That column was mostly just sneering, but Williamson put a
lot of effort into letting the reader know he took pleasure in not only
evicting his wayward tenants, but also in observing the suffering of the
poor people in housing court. I grew up dirt poor, so I have no
illusions about poverty. Poor people are poor mostly because they have
low-IQ’s and poor impulse control. Progressive efforts to romanticize
poverty were always ridiculous, but that does not mean we should take
pleasure in their suffering. That’s just sick.

Regular readers of this blog will know that my view of the Official
Right and their slow-witted little brother, Official Libertarianism, is
that they trail along behind the Progressives, as they flit from one fad
to the next. Their contempt for the Dissident Right is not about
ideology. It’s that they think the scruffy trouble makers to their Right
make them look bad to their friends on the Left. It’s hard to make $30K
from college speeches when the people running the college are blaming
you for the alt-right hate-thinkers.

Maybe that’s why there is a market on the Official Right for the type of
contemptuous poverty porn Williamson is peddling. The Left has made
hatred of working class white people that shop at Walmart a centerpiece
of their identity. Hillary Clinton ran for President on a platform of
“White People Suck.” Perhaps the Official Right is just aping what they
see, but with their own spin on it.

Hating Poor Whites”</a> is probably in the works at National Review.
