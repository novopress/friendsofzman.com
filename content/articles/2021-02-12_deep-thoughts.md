This is always a funny time of year. There is the long run up to the
holidays that starts in November and concludes in January. In election
years you have that as an added bit of excitement. Then it all comes to
an end in January, the dead of winter for most of the country, and
people go on a bit of break. This year the denouement came a bit late
due to the fake election and fake inauguration. The entirely peaceful
excitement around the fake inauguration was an added bonus to the
season.

Now, we are in the dead of winter. You can see it on the streets in the
parts of the country that have winter. Here in Lagos, the streets look
like peak lockdown all of a sudden, in that there are few cars out
during the day. It has been snowing here a bit and the schools remain
closed, but it is extra quiet now. Who knows what the people are doing
when not out on the roads, but the people in charge assure us everything
is under control and we are all in this together. Trust science.

This dead spot in the calendar has always shown up on-line, as well. The
slowest traffic month every year is February, January is pretty slow
too. March is always the busiest as people seem to come back to life as
we head into spring. Humans are still hardwired to the natural rhythms
of our environment. Spring is the busiest time on the site, then things
slack off a bit for summer, as people get out and live. It ticks up for
the autumnal excitement, especially if there is an election.

This being that dull spot in the calendar, this week the show is about
some more contemplative topics. One of the things that is striking is
just how open the new ruling regime is about their hatred of white
people. Those over the age of fifty, maybe over forty, remember when
such talk was used as satire. It was ridiculous to think that white
people would be treated like second class citizens. Here we are though,
and most people are still struggling to process it.

Of course, the people on the other side of this transaction remain a
mystery to the sorts of people attracted to right-wing politics.
Right-wing people try to understand the partisan mind in the same way
they understand the normal mind. They start with the assumption that the
partisan is motivated by self-interest. The trouble is the partisan
interprets self-interest to mean their cause. Everything they are is
defined by their membership in the cause. It transcends everything, even
their life.

It is a good time to think about all this stuff. The Pretender is
staggering around drawing smiley faces on executive orders written by
his staff. The media is waging war on imaginary insurrectionist. The
health Nazis continue to play make believe over the coronavirus stuff.
Otherwise, not a lot going on, so the show this week is about some of
those topics. Since these topics require a little more thought and
analysis than a new story, just three topics this week.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
