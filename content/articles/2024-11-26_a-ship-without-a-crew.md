It appears the plan is to fill the time between now and when Donald
Trump regains the White House with stories about starting a nuclear war
with Russia. First, we got the NATO missiles strikes on Russia, then it
was the Russian use of a mystery weapon that should terrify everyone.
Instead, the response from NATO is a series of stories about doing even
dumber things than the missile strikes. It is as if Western leaders are
in a contest to see who can think of the dumbest idea possible.

So far this week we have stories leaking out from Europe that the Brits
and French are <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14122989/Britain-France-not-ruling-sending-troops-Ukraine-European-coalition-support-war-Trump-military-aid-report.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">talking</a> about sending an
“expeditionary force” to Ukraine. That was followed by <a
href="https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/11/25/nato-is-discussing-the-possibility-of-preemptive-strikes-against-russia-bauer"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">comments</a> from the head of the NATO
Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, suggesting NATO launch preemptive
strikes on Russia. All of this is taking place in the looming shadow of
a second Trump administration. The Europeans are carrying on as if
Godzilla is approaching the continent.

Of course, all these ideas are being floated by people who would urinate
themselves if faced with a physical confrontation. Keir Starmer and
Emmanuel Macron are ridiculous people who have landed in these positions
due to the collapse of their respective political classes. The rest of
the European political class is equally silly, but most lack the vanity
of these two. Most are like German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who seems to
cherish being a middling mediocrity.

The question that is never asked is how did it come to this? Surely
Britain has better men than Keir Starmer. The UK has a lot of problems,
but it still has some of the best human capital on the planet. The same
is true of France. This is a country that defined diplomacy in the West.
There must be a deep well of talent in the country, despite generations
of bad policy making. How in the world did these two feckless nitwits
end up ruling these two once great nations?

Obviously, these two men did not arrive on the scene by chance. They
were selected and groomed by the political system that rules their
countries. They made the right friends, followed the right advice and
most importantly, never asked the wrong questions about the current
narrative. In many respects, these two men were selected purely on
narrative grounds. They filled a role in the story better than the
alternatives, so they got the job and here we are on the verge of war.

It is the machine that generates the narratives that makes it possible
for so many mediocrities to bubble up to the surface of the system. For
example, the crackpot idea of an expeditionary force was not dreamed up
by Starmer or Macron. This has been floated by the best thinks tanks in
the West. Here is a <a
href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/joint-expeditionary-force-global-britain-northern-europe"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the Center for Strategic
and International Studies talking up the expeditionary force. It was
written by what the system calls an expert on the topic.

This idea is part of a larger narrative that assumes, like all
managerial class narratives, that the world can be set right if the
managerial elite simply has the will. That is the themes of this <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/25/who-is-really-escalating-the-war-in-ukraine-it-certainly-isnt-the-west"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in The Guardian by one of the
UK’s top experts on the war in Ukraine and Russia in general. It is a
completely insane post that has no bearing on objective reality, but
that is not important. What is important is it tells guys like Starmer
that the good guys have the will to make the narrative real.

That post is not written by the typical kook that fills the pages of The
Guardian, but by a fellow calling himself James Nixey. He leads the
Russia-Eurasia program at Chatham House, which is a prestigious think
tank in the UK. In other words, he is a guy people like Starmer will
call for advice on Russia. Note that Mr. Nixey is
<a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/james-nixey"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">barely qualified</a> to offer tour advice
on Russia. His entire life has been about sitting in a room somewhere
imagining what life is like outside that room.

This is a recurring theme in Western politics. From top to bottom it is
people who are very good at playing along inside imagination land and
even better at avoiding anything that resembles real life experience.
Generations ago, the Prime Minister would have served in the military
and maybe even seen war. Even the more effete politicians could rely on
a class of men who understood how the world actually worked. Today such
men are treated as skunks at a picnic.

In the fullness of time, the defining characteristic of managerialism
will be its boiling off of the capable, independent men in favor or
complaint mediocrities. Lacking genuine men of action, the compliant
mediocrities search for consensus, which becomes their authority figure
and their moral authority. It is why everything that comes from the
think tanks and media reinforces the agreed upon positions. The most
terrifying thing for a mediocre man is to stand alone against the
consensus.

The narratives we keep seeing serve to make manifest the consensus and
cast those within the consensus as the white hat in the drama. Much of
what seems to drive these mediocre men of late-stage managerialism is
moral affirmation. It is why they have all herded themselves off the
Ukraine cliff. They care only for being seen at the sincerest believer
in the prevailing narrative. For the political class, it means public
policy is always a public act of piety.

If the crew of a ship all die at once, the ship does not immediately
capsize. It will float around until it runs aground or succumbs to a big
wave. On rare occasions it makes its way to land in one piece. That is
the West right now. It is a ship bobbing around, crewed by mediocre men
who are terrified at the thought of being in charge. Instead, they
huddle together inside a consensus and ruthlessly enforce it. To
continue the metaphor, they are below decks debating the need for a
captain.
