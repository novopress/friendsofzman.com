Last year I did a show on the concept of civilizationalism, but I
thought it was a good idea to revisit the topic now that Trump is back
in town. Many of the things Trump has been saying since the election
suggest he is headed in this direction, even if he does not think much
about the concept. The tides of history are dragging him along toward
this new organizational model.

The short definition of civilizationalism is that instead of humanity
organized into countries or empires, it will be organized by
civilization. Language, culture, history, tradition, and religion are
not immutable, but they are not malleable. They evolve over long periods
of time, so they feel permanent to us. These are things that resist the
best efforts of the ideologues.

The last time I addressed this topic it was in the historical
perspective. The show this time is about the nuts and bolts of it. We
are seeing the rough contours in the world and even in the behavior of
Trump. His desire to annex Greenland and Canada is not much different
from Russia reabsorbing Ukraine into the Russian world. Canada and
Greenland are part of the American civilization.
