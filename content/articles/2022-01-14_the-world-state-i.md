One of the things that plagues opposition to the ruling regime is a
poverty of language to label what is happening. The bad guys have a
million ways to label their enemies, but the good guys are lacking a
language to categorize the other side. The paleocons got close when they
coined the term managerialism. This is both accurate and simple, but it
only describes one aspect of the current system. Managerialism is one
result of an ideology that has evolved over the last century.

When people hear the word “Marxism” or “communism” they immediately
think of a set of economic arrangements. They may not know much about
Marx or Marxism, but they know that it means the end of property and the
rule by a party of ideologues. It is a simple and effective label. The
same is true of communism or socialism. These words have connotations
that make for effective shorthand. Even capitalism, a thing that may not
actually exist, carries meaning for people.

We don’t have a label like that for the current political regime.
Liberal democracy is probably accurate, but it has positive
connotations. Democracy is supposed to be a good thing and liberal
government is peaceful and accommodating. There are examples of things
that are good separately but horrible together, like fish ice cream, but
that is not really the same thing. When people in the public square use
the term liberal democracy, they tend to use it in a positive way.

This conundrum is the inspiration for the show. Instead of trying to
come up with a clever label for the current political order, maybe the
better starting place is to just describe some of the big attributes.
After all, the word “Marxism” did not come into use until the thing
itself existed in some form. Once we can come up with a description for
what we are experiencing, then maybe a label comes into focus. At the
minimum, it starts the process of thinking about it beyond platitudes.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
