Loretta Lynn died this week. She was 90 years old, so she had a long
run, if not necessarily a good run. Like many of the country stars of
her era, her personal life was often complicated. Most were people who
lived hard lives and their music was often about the consequences of
living a hard life. Of course, their audience was mostly people who also
had complicated lives.

It is trite to say upon the passing of an icon that they are not making
them like that anymore, but in the case of these old country stars it is
true. They really are products of a bygone era. Pop music stars of all
genres are now manufactured products, created by a system that selects
for stability and predictability. The days of the gonzo rock star or
wild living country star are long gone.

In the case of Loretta Lynn, she is also the last of the alternative
feminists that flourished in the country scene into the 1970’s. We think
of feminism as the increasingly deranged nonsense that comes from the
harpies on the college campus, but for a long time there was an
alternative to the left-wing feminism. This alternative conception of
the strong women turned up in classic country songs.

Probably the closest thing today to that old right-wing image of the
strong female is the trad-wife business, but that is more of an internet
meme. It is also more about what it opposes than what it proposes. Like
so much of what passes for right-wing now, it is mostly a reaction to
the excesses of the culture wreckers. Perhaps in time it will mature
into a genuine alternative to the lunacy of feminism.

Of course, when one of these old legends dies, and there are not many of
them left at this point, it is a reminder that they came from a world
that has been entirely replaced by something different. The world that
produced someone like Loretta Lynn is gone and the audience she appealed
to is also gone. There was a clean break somewhere in the last few
generations and that old world is fading away.

It is most obvious in the case of someone like Loretta Lynn. She grew up
in what we call grinding poverty. Fifty years ago, everyone knew someone
who came from such conditions because we still had lots of genuine poor
people. A young person today will expect to live their whole life never
having met a poor person. That is poor as in no food poor, not as in not
the newest gaming console poor.

It is not an accident that the collapse of authenticity and realism in
the popular culture tracks with the elimination of want. Those old
country stars like Lynn could sing about the troubles of the human
condition because they lived them and more important, their audience was
living them. In a world where the hardest choices are on the menu,
people are not interested in the human condition.
