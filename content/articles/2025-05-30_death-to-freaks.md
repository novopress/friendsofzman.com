While everyone is enjoying a bit of a respite from the crazies flying
their freak flags in our faces, it is important to remember that they
have not gone away. Like cicadas, they have merely gone into
hibernation. There they will rest up and conjure some new versions of
their egalitarian lunacy. A decade from now they will spring forth and
start the cycle of madness over again.

In the interim, the people who orchestrated the freakshow will be busy
gnawing away at the fibers of society in an effort to prevent
regeneration. They can still use Trump to generate support and get money
from soulless oligarchs, who think underwriting this stuff will bring
them peace. The lawfare we see against the Trump admin is a good example
of what will be the norm now.

The crazies will also refit their image by disposing of the old freaks
and finding new freaks to be the face of their craziness. Expect new
faces in the media saying the same old things but with new language.
Just as the New Democrat was the old crazies in new baby boomer
wrappers, the next round of freaks will be the same freaks but dressed
up in the garb of the new generation of millennials.

That is the show this week. It is a vacation week for many and a slow
week in general, so I am trying to keep in light. Even though it is fun
to mock these people now that the tide has turned against them, it is
important to remember that the freaks never change, and they never quit.
The coming peace in the culture war is a false dawn. True peace only
comes when freaks are permanently forced to the margins.
