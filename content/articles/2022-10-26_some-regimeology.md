<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-fog-of-regime-ology/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Regimeology</a> is a concept that needs
much broader interest, as it is becoming an essential tool to
understanding the current age. As the regime blacks out its windows and
boards up the exits, the only way to understand what is happening inside
the black box that is the ruling elite is to analyze the actions and
media statements to then tease out some explanation for what we can
observe. Like Kremlinology, it is the only tool we have to understand
what is happening inside the system.

We have something new to analyze. The so-called progressive caucus sent
a letter to the White House and the senior members of the inner party
suggesting they were not onboard with the Ukraine war. They were careful
to not break with official dogma on the war, but they were signaling to
their supporters that they may at some point begin to question Ukraine
policy. It was a very tepid bit of pushback, but they made the letter
public so their fans could see it.

The reason they did this is the antiwar left is freaking out about the
war and the fact that no one in the party they support is opposing it.
The Bernie Sanders wing is supposed to be opposed to these wars and the
machine behind them. Yet in this case they are silently nodding along
with the warmongers. A group of antiwar people ambushed Sandy Cortez at
an event where she was spouting neocon lines about the war and the
resulting video was a huge embarrassment for her.

It was a nice little peak inside how the regime uses the far left to
manipulate the various tribes that make up the Democratic coalition.
They let these people speak against regime policy as a pressure release,
but the unwritten rule is they can never threaten to block regime
policy. It is the same theater the outer party uses to keep
conservatives showing up to the polls. The guys at Trump rallies wearing
tricorn hats are not the only chumps exploited by this system.

The interesting bit here is how quickly the hammer came down. The Biden
White House and senior party members held an emergency meeting and then
threatened the progressive caucus with death if they did not recant. We
do not know the exact nature of the threats, but the speed with which
the apostates recanted and their groveling tone suggest <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/25/house-progressives-russia-diplomacy-00063338"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">genuine fear</a>. Whatever was said to
them was serious enough to have them groveling in public within hours.

Just in case anyone missed the point, the regime then <a
href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/25/2022/bernie-sanders-the-house-progressive-caucus-ukraine-letter-was-wrong"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">sent</a> Bernie Sanders out to chastise
the progressives for being wrong. Sanders has spent his life railing
against the military industrial complex. He has opposed every military
action, even those sponsored by his party. Now he sounds like Bill
Kristol after a few too many drinks. Bernie is not just supporting the
war; he is supporting the war dogma behind it. He felt he needed to get
that out into the public domain.

The old internet meme about knowing who is in charge by thinking about
who you are not allowed to criticize works here. If you want to know
what it is important to the regime, think about what cannot be
questioned. It is clear that they will tolerate no dissent on Ukraine
policy, not even from the people they use to manipulate the left-wing
activist class. In other words, they are willing to lose the support of
their activist base in order to defend their Ukraine policy.

This is why the outer party has been silent on the war. There is no
support for the Ukraine war policy, so the opposition party should be
waving this around as part of the argument against their opponents. Most
Americans would like to see a negotiated settlement to a problem they do
not think is our problem. Despite the overwhelming support for a
moderate position, everyone in the outer party is just as extreme as
everyone in the inner party.

The question is why has the ruling class pushed all of their chips into
the middle of the table on this issue? Objectively it is a bad bet.
Ukraine is a backward and deeply corrupt country with no real chance of
winning this war. The only reason it has gone this far is some version
of why Bolshevism succeeded. The old line was that communism was the
result of Jewish brains, Latvian swords and Russian stupidity. This war
is the product of neocon paranoia, American arms and Russian stupidity.

That may be one clue as to why Washington is obsessed with this war. It
is the last stand for the post-Cold War consensus and the neocon place
within it. A settlement with the Russians on Ukraine would lead to a
settlement on many other issues, like the wars against Syria and Iran.
If you can make a deal with the Russians in one area, then there is no
reason to not make a deal in other areas. In other words, the neocons
need Russia as the eternal enemy in order to exist.

Another possible reason is the general paranoia of the aging leadership.
Old people in power naturally get suspicious of the next generation.
Look around Washington and across the board you see ossified geezers
locked in place. Rather than the paranoia of one or two fossils it is a
culture of paranoia among a gerontocracy. The Ukraine war just happens
to be the issue through which they are exercising their intolerance of
dissent, but it could be any issue.

Of course, there is always graft. Hundreds of billions are flowing into
what is now a giant money laundering operation. This is the bust out of
all bust outs and every serious player in Washington is getting a taste.
The only place more dangerous than the area between a principled
conservative and money is the area between a committed progressive and
the same pile of money. As the saying goes, never mess with a man’s
money or his women. Got that Jack?

Regardless, it suggests that the regime sees this war as one they cannot
afford to lose, much in the same way Washington viewed Vietnam fifty
years ago. Back then, that worthless backwater was the hill to die on
for reasons no one could explain, but no one was allowed to question
until it was too late. It is ironic that a generation that was born in
the protests against the Vietnam war is closing the show by making the
same errors policy makers made with regards to Vietnam policy.
