One of the truths of democratic politics is that enemies tend to be
forever, while friends tend to be temporary. The reason is politics is
personal. When someone does something to harm you in politics, you take
it personally. You remember it long after the harm has been forgotten.
When someone does you a favor, in contrast, it tends to be
transactional, as the person doing the favor is acting from
self-interest. Favors are impersonal, while harms are always personal.

This is something Kevin McCarthy is learning right now. His climb to the
speaker’s chair has been sidetracked by a small group of malcontents.
They oppose him becoming the next Speaker of the House because they do
not like him. More important, they think he is a shameless liar, so they
do not trust him. The reason they think this is that Kevin McCarthy is a
shameless liar. To get where he is he had to knife people in the back,
because he has no other qualifications for the job.

It will never be said publicly, but his role in knifing Congressman
Steve King in the back, at the behest of the donor class, burned up his
capital. If he is willing to work with the New York Times to ruin a
Steve King, how can anyone in the caucus be sure he will not do the same
trick to them? Politics is a sleazy business, but the reason to be in a
party is to have the protection of the party. McCarthy broke an
important rule so he is a man with few friends, only money to spread
around.

Another truth of politics is that when you take a shot at the king you
better not miss, which is where the anti-McCarthy forces are right now.
They have to hang together or they will hang alone. Just in case that is
not clear, the self-aggrandizing sociopath from Texas, Dan Crenshaw,
gave one of his [typical
tantrums](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dan-crenshaw-calls-anti-mccarthy-republicans-enemies-in-fiery-interview/ar-AA15WekO)
to the press, calling the holdouts forever enemies of the uniparty. In
Hell right now, Stalin is slapping John McCain on the back why saying,
“That’s your boy!”

The unspoken truth of this fiasco is that this would not be possible if
the FBI had allowed the Republicans to sweep the midterms. If it had
been a red wave, McCarthy would have had no trouble getting the votes
from all of those newly minted House members excited to be in
Washington. Instead, the FBI only allowed the GOP to gain a small
majority to keep up appearances. That gives this small band of holdouts
the chance to throw a wrench in the works of the uniparty.

This brings up the question that no one in the media dares ask. That is,
why is it just fifteen members of the party opposing this oleaginous
snake? For a long time, we have been told that most of the party is
conservative, but the leadership is the problem, always cutting deals
with the Democrats. If the conservatives could get control of the
leadership, then things would change. It turns out that conservatives
are as rare as hen’s teeth in the Republican Party.

The truth is, George Washington was right. No man is so virtuous as to
resist the highest bidder and that is axiomatically true in politics.
Marjorie Taylor Greene switched teams for the promise of some
legitimacy. The party promised to let he pretend to be a serious person
in exchange for her support of the uniparty. It turns out that those
stories about old Marge being a cheap date were true. It is a good
reminder that character is your best guide, even in the sleazy world of
politics.

Of course, this whole affair is shining light on a truth about our
politics. Democracy is just a show to conceal the real power in society.
The holdouts know that they will get nothing from this, even if McCarthy
steps aside. The guy who takes his place will be dancing the tune the
donors call. Again, for the holdouts, this is not really about
principle. They just hate Kevin McCarthy so they are taking their shot.
In the end they know the Speaker will be a puppet of the donors.

This affair also suggests that the donors and their puppets in the two
parties are tiring of the game of make believe. Once it was clear that
the people are too docile to push back against things like lockdowns and
mask wearing, no one in charge had any reason to worry about fooling the
people with the democracy show. They can have this embarrassing food
fight in public, because who cares about the public? Certainly, no one
in either party or the pirates that control them.

It is why the right way to view it is as just another carny act on the
stage that is liberal democratic politics. It is all sound and fury
signifying nothing, but there is no harm in enjoying the suffering of
the people made to perform on the stage. Given the age in which we live,
expect the holdouts to be bought off or threatened by the FBI and this
whole thing comes to end today. McCarthy is human filth, but he does
what he is told, so the donors will probably save him.

Even so, there is a lesson for dissidents. Politics is always about
friends and enemies, not abstract ideas. The goal is to increase your
pool of friends, while limiting the pool of enemies you create in the
process. Politics is always personal. Those who go out of their way to
create drama and stir up conflict are always bad for your politics, so
the best course is to avoid those people. You may not always be able to
count on your friends, but you can always count on your enemies.
