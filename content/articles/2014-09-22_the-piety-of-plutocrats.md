Steve Sailer has lately been plucking hilarious examples of
self-beclownment from the NYTimes and arguing it is deliberate. I’m not
sure if he is right, but it would be nice if it is deliberate. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stories like this</a> suggest
otherwise.

*John D. Rockefeller built a vast fortune on oil. Now his heirs are
abandoning fossil fuels.*

*The family whose legendary wealth flowed from Standard Oil is planning
to announce on Monday that its $860 million philanthropic organization,
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is joining the divestment movement that
began a couple years ago on college campuses.*

*The announcement, timed to precede Tuesday’s opening of the United
Nations climate change summit meeting in New York City, is part of a
broader and accelerating initiative.*

The picture above the text is dripping with sanctimonious self-regard.
These people arranged for the profile on a left-wing platform so they
could advertise their virtue before a major left-wing gathering. The
breathless prose in the saccharine you get a cavity reading it. The key
bits are right there in the beginning. It is a “movement” and that means
it has religious overtones. Religions are just a type of mass movement.
The fact that it started on college campuses is a big deal to the Cult.
That means it is innocent and pure, according to the mythology of their
faith.

*In recent years, 180 institutions — including philanthropies, religious
organizations, pension funds and local governments — as well as hundreds
of wealthy individual investors have pledged to sell assets tied to
fossil fuel companies from their portfolios and to invest in cleaner
alternatives. In all, the groups have pledged to divest assets worth
more than $50 billion from portfolios, and the individuals more than $1
billion, according to Arabella Advisors, a firm that consults with
philanthropists and investors to use their resources to achieve social
goals.*

*The people who are selling shares of energy stocks are well aware that
their actions are unlikely to have an immediate impact on the companies,
given their enormous market capitalizations and cash flow.*

The money involved here is not even a rounding error. That’s not the
point. They really don’t want to have any impact on these firms. The
whole point of this is to bask in the warm glow of the self-satisfaction
that comes from a public act of piety. In another age, these idiots
would have donated a bull to the festival to be slaughtered at the
temple.
