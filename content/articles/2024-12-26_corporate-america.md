Just in time for Christmas, the “tech bros”, who jumped on the Trump
bandwagon last summer, launched a campaign on Twitter in favor of
infinite Indian migration, for all the long ago debunked economic
reasons. The trigger for this was Trump naming
<a href="https://x.com/sriramk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">someone</a> calling himself Sriram Krishnan to an
advisory board. This person was a Kamala supporter, in addition to being
a strong advocate for bringing all his countryman to live in your
neighborhood.

It is unlikely that Trump thought much about Sriram Krishnan before
naming him to this advisory board, as it is not an important post. It
looks like he took the recommendation of David Sacks, who is running a
technology advisory board for Trump. David Sack is an open borders
fanatic for all the expected reasons. He spent Christmas day trying to
justify Sriram Krishnan’s appointment as “America First”, while also
defending unlimited immigration from India.

It was not just David Sacks trying to subvert the meaning of American
First. Elon Musk took time away from not celebrating Christmas to push
the idea of unlimited immigration from India as well. Like all the tech
bros, nation wreckers and open society types, his claim rests on the
obvious lie that India is full of future Einsteins that America must
recruit in order to win. What we win by turning your neighborhood into a
New Delhi slum is never explained, because it is a lie.

This episode is a good reminder that modern America is cursed with one
of the worst economic elites in human history. Most of what they do adds
nothing to the country or the stock of human capital. Silicon Valley is
now just financial flim-flams and financial legerdemain masquerading as
a tech sector. Like the Wall Street economy, the Silicon Valley economy
is just a skim, not a lot different than how the mafia operated Las
Vegas or the Teamsters Union back in the 1970’s.

The main difference between the mafia and the current oligarchs is the
mafia knew it was the mafia, while the current oligarchs think they are
some weird combination of religious leader and entrepreneurial genius.
Elon Musk is Valentine Michael Smith from the Heinlein novel, *Stranger
in a Strange Land*. Instead of promising sexual liberation, he is
selling motorized doorstops and trips to Mars. The original Valentine
Smith came from Mars and this one wants to return.

It is easy to hate the oligarchs as sociopathic greed heads, but they
are a symptom of a deeper problem with post-Cold War America. The reason
these guys exist is that after the Cold War, America fell into an old
bad habit of seeing itself as nothing more than an economic zone to be
exploited. This is a current in American history that goes back to the
colonies, when the New World was nothing more than an untapped economic
zone to be exploited by who got to it first.

This is something Tocqueville observed in his travels around America.
There has never been an enduring sense of American identity, other than
the idea that making money is the heart of American liberty. The way to
avoid the exploitative relationships common in the old world is to
maintain a free economy so that anyone can get rich. The concept of
“Fuck You Money” is based in this belief. You can get rich enough to not
fear coercion from the government or the other rich people.

One main reason people admire Musk is he is the ultimate example of the
guy who has achieved “Fuck You Money” status. He is the world’s richest
man and the world’s biggest shit poster online. Instead of bending the
knee to the Indians running Twitter, he bought the platform for probably
two or three times its value. In reality, Musk paid $44 billion for what
amounts to a poorly coded message board. He overpaid for it because he
has “Fuck You Money”.

Many in the MAGA movement slobber over Musk because of this, but there
is an evil that lies behind all of it. Oligarchs like Musk do not see
America as their home, but as a company they just acquired. The
triumphalism of the tech bros is that they now think with Trump in the
White House, they can do what Musk did with Twitter, to the whole
country and reorganize it for their purposes. They are the board that
took the company called America private and now plan to reorganize it.

This is the next turn of the wheel in the managerial revolution that
kicked off a century ago with the rise of the American empire. The large
shareholders have become disenchanted with management, so they are
shaking things up. The trouble is the shareholders are not American in
any meaningful sense. If they think
<a href="https://x.com/sriramk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this
guy</a> is as American as those with just one passport, then their
definition of citizen is no different from their definition of employee.

It is tempting to call this feudalism, mostly because feudalism has an
odor about it, but the feudal elite actually had a bond with the
peasants. The feudal order started with the reciprocal relationships
between the elites, but it also included vertical relations that bound
the top to the bottom. The king had a duty to his people. In this age,
the oligarch has no duty to his employees. They are mere economic units
to be exploited in order to fulfil his obligations to his fellow
shareholders.

What we are seeing is an effort to transform the fundamental relations
between the citizens and the state, but also among the citizens
themselves. Your duty to your neighbor is now the same as your duty to
Apu in IT, who was just flown in from Bangalore to replace your
neighbor. Everyone is now supposed to see themselves as employees of
America Inc., which is now run by people who view you as an expense to
be reduced and a liability to be eliminated.

It is not a big leap from using the income statement to justify
unlimited Indian immigration to using it to justify involuntary suicide
or the deportation of citizens who are no longer working out for
American Inc. If economics trump the moral arguments against
immigration, then there are no moral arguments that can trump economics
when it comes to anything else. Once citizenship is defined as
employment, everything and everyone is a slave to the bottom line.

The flaw in this is no rational man will sacrifice for his CEO. The
transactional relationship between employer and employee cannot work for
a society, because of the fundamental compact at the heart of every
human society. The people tolerate and even sacrifice for the elites in
a human society, because those elites provide protection through the
mechanism of government. If those elites are no longer willing to
provide protection, then the reason to tolerate them evaporates.

Perhaps this is the sign that we are fully in late-stage managerialism.
The economic elites sense America Inc. is faltering, so they step in to
force a change in management, without understanding the root cause of
the problem. They view Trump as a turnaround specialist who can reverse
the fortunes of the enterprise, while maintaining the transactional
relationship between themselves and the people. In the end it must fail
because American is not a corporation. It is a people.
