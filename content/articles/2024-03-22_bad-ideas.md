Intellectual history is generally the study of good ideas or what we
currently think are good ideas, but it is the bad ideas that have the
most impact. The use of slave labor in the New World, for example,
seemed like a good idea at the time but has proven to be a terrible
burden on us. If the slavers knew that their descendants would be
tormented by the consequences of slavery, would they still have done it?

Of course, the life of a bad idea is the result of the people choosing
to embrace the bad idea, often when it is obviously a bad idea. Much of
what Marx had to say about economics, even in the context of his age,
was obvious nonsense. Further, people knew enough about the human
condition to know that communism could never possibly work, but
intellectuals chose to embrace it anyway.

Put another way, stupid ideas need a special sort of stupid person.
Orwell famously wrote, “One has to belong to the intelligentsia to
believe things like that; no ordinary man could be such a fool.” Orwell
was addressing the educated opinion in England at the time that Germany
would win the war. The basic concept is something of a universal, as we
see today with our “expert” class.

Even so, ideas matter and this age is haunted by bad ideas that should
have been relegated to the dustbin of history. That is the show this
week. It is a breezy survey of some of the bad ideas that still vex us.
It is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but the things that came to
mind when I cooked up the idea for a show. Feel free to add your
favorite stupid ideas to the list.
