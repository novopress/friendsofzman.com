If you are one of the many schemers in Washington, or you dream of
becoming a schemer in Washington, this is a troubling time. By now Trump
should be in exile, having had to quit the presidential race due to his
many legal troubles and the collapse in his support due to those legal
troubles. A more acceptable candidate was supposed to have emerged and
pushed Trump out of the race. This was the narrative the schemers in
Washington have lived by for over a year.

In what is becoming a regular feature of our politics, the narrative did
not turn out as written and the scramble is on for a narrative update.
There are still the court cases in Georgia, New York, Florida and
Washington. The last two are in Federal court, but the Mark Steyn case
tells us that we may all be dead before they get going. The Georgia case
may fall apart due to racism. Apparently, racism made the DA turn the
case into a chance to give her lover public money.

Of course, the big hole plowed through the narrative was the first two
contests of the primary season, where Trump won easily. By the time Iowa
came around all but three non-Trump candidates had quit the race. After
Iowa it was the neocon offering, but she was trounced in New Hampshire,
thus leaving Trump as the presumptive nominee, assuming nothing untoward
happens this spring or summer. Few in Washington expected this to be the
state of affairs at this point.

This is what makes the Texas border showdown an interesting thing. All
of a sudden, we get word that Mitch McConnell is telling his party that
the politics of immigration have flipped and they need to rally to Trump
on the issue. Then Greg Abbott finds his inner confederate and defies
the Feds with regards to the razor wire he had installed in a public
park that sits along the border. Finally, we have every Republican
governor rallying to his side in this fight with the Feds.

The first thing to consider here is that the Republican Party is the
party of scheming perfidious finks, so whatever they are doing is not on
the level. This is a party that selects for people who live to fink.
They should just rename the party to “The Fink Party” but that would be
a degree of candor no fink could muster. That also means that their
sudden embrace of immigration and Trump’s position on it is not on the
level. They are up to shenanigans because it is their nature.

One angle is that they suddenly realize that immigration is important to
the voters despite the best effort of regime media to anathematize the
issue. Voters in Iowa and New Hampshire listed immigration as a top
concern. This never happens. Voters always put economic concerns at the
top, because people are practical. This means immigration has leaked
into the domain of the practical. All of a sudden, the Republicans have
to pretend to care about immigration.

There may be something more perfidious afoot. Those court cases are
still ongoing and one of them is scheduled to start in March. That means
Trump is still in legal jeopardy and could be removed from the ticket.
The issue is timing. They could not conjure an alternative in the
primaries, so maybe they are looking to get a replacement ready, perhaps
as his running mate. In other words, maybe word went out that there is a
casting call for who will be Trump’s future replacement.

From the scheming weasel point of view, this is a good save to the
official narrative that had Trump dropping out by the end of 2023. He
cruises along winning delegates, picks a regime approved running mate
and then is convicted in the summer. The party then does some hand
ringing and decides to expel him from the party and tab his running mate
as the party nominee. “We really hate to do this but with Trump facing
jail time, we have to go with his top choice to replace him.”

It sounds like 4-D chess, but these are people who traffic in finkery.
Shenanigans are like water to a fish or oxygen to a human. We know the
collection of flunkies who ran in the primary did so becasue they were
told Trump would be removed. They admitted as much during the debates.
It is not unreasonable to think word has gone out to the governors that
there will be a new casting call for players in the updated version of
the Never Trump narrative that remains a hit in Washington.

Then you have the fact that what Texas is doing is mostly a show. This
area they are walling off from the Feds is a tiny portion of the border.
The park itself remains wide open to the Feds. If they wanted to do it,
they could take down the razor wire, but thus far they have not done it.
As for the states voicing support and sending national guard units, this
is a cost-free gesture. They risk nothing in doing it, as even the
national party thinks it is okay to sound butch on immigration.

One other factor suggests there are shenanigans afoot. There was the
rumor that Trump might consider Haley as a running mate. This seems to
have come from Washington and probably has a kernel of truth to it. The
party may be offering to support Trump in his legal and political
fights, if he agrees to a running mate that is on good terms with the
regime. There has no doubt been discussions about this between the party
and the Trump campaign.

All that said, Trump has proven to be one of the most resilient and
lucky political figures to come around in generations. He is probably
shrewd enough to avoid picking a running mate that could be his
replacement. That just means the shenanigans will take another turn this
spring. The regime hates Trump with the intensity of a thousand suns so
they will never relent. What the first month of the political year tells
us is that 2024 will be the year of the fink.
