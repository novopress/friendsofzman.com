For as long as I have been alive, I’ve felt different. It was one of
those things I only noticed when the other kids did not notice it. Their
lack of noticing is what make it so clear to me. I could never come up
with the right words so I kept my thoughts bottled up, knowing that no
one would notice, hoping I could ignore it. The other kids did not
notice it because I’m invisible. That’s right. I’m one of millions of
Americans who are invisible.

The opaque community takes their opacity for granted. They just think
the fact that they reflect light is normal, while not reflecting light
is strange or weird. They just take it for granted that others can see
them so they pretend to see us. This attempt to normalize the invisible
by insisting we can be seen has gone on for too long. It is time for the
invisible community to be seen, so to speak. We have be living without
shadows for too long!

This is nonsense, of course, but is it any more ridiculous than men in
sundresses demanding the rest of us pretend they are girls? Bruce Jenner
is not a female. He is a male. He can dress up as a girl and have
himself mutilated so he looks like a girl, but he is a man. Humans come
in one of two sexes, male and female. This is a matter of genetics.

The veracity of my claims to invisibility are just easily tested. You
could hold up a mirror and see if I have a visible reflection. If so,
then I am not invisible. Alternatively, you could put a light on one
side of me and check to see if the light passes through me. If I blocked
the light, then I am opaque. This is basic physics and a debatable
topic.

The question is why are we forced to indulge the lunacy of one denial of
reality, but not other forms of reality denying? One reason is that
burly men in sundresses appeals to the flat earth society types, who
insist humans are born as amorphous blobs. Claims to invisibility don’t
further the cause of the blank slate. That and forcing the rest of us to
ignore the invisible would be counterproductive for attention seekers.

There’s also the fact that the lunatics promoting this stuff truly
believe it horrifies the sane, normal people out in squaresville. A big
part of radicalism from the French Revolution to the present, is the
desire to be shocking and outrageous. Radicalism, political or cultural,
is mostly a temper tantrum by people who can accept the world as it is.
Just as a spoiled child throws tantrums in public, the radical seeks to
offend those they see as normal.

Then there is the Theodore Dalrymple observation from years ago:

> “In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the
> purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not
> to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded

> they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are
> forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their
> sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is…in some small way to
> become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded,
> and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.
> I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect

That’s the lesson from
<a href="http://www.thegetrealmom.com/blog/womensrestroom"
target="_blank">this story</a> about a good, progressive mother of small
children, having to stand silently as a burly man, claiming to be a
women, uses the lady’s room at Disneyland.

> So yes… there were women and small children using the restroom and

A society in which no one knows the rules, except the rulers, is a
society that cannot self-organize. It must fall into
authoritarianism. In fact, it must embrace authoritarianism, because
there must be order. Even the madness of North Korea beats anarchy,
where it is a war of all against all. To no small degree, the people
pushing the denial of biological reality are doing so in order to expand
their authority over the rest of us.

There’s another angle here though, one that is not reductionist.
Progressives have been in control of America since the Civil War. The
great industrial wars of the early 20th century, then the long Cold War,
worked to restrain some of the worst impulses that are let loose when a
person or group has unchecked power. Those restraints are gone so all of
the reckless tendencies of Progressives can be indulged, seemingly
without consequence.

In other words, this reality denying madness we see going on with
Progressives, has a late phase degeneracy vibe to it. Most of this
nonsense is happening in well insulated compounds like the college
campus. The Progs have total control so all of their worst instincts are
free to run riot. It’s not some new phase in the long civil war, but the
final burst of maniacal lunacy before there is the knock on the door and
reality bursts in.
