Andrew Tate is a former professional kickboxer who transformed himself
into an internet personality by mixing ghetto culture with manosphere
memes. He offered courses to young males in the art of being a pickup
artist. He gained widespread attention after his banning from social
media platforms. He is currently in a Romanian prison awaiting trial for
a number of sex crimes. Despite his predicament, he remains
[boastful](https://www.the-sun.com/news/7083101/andrew-tate-tristan-hospital-jail/)
about his abilities and what lies ahead for him.

Tate’s penchant for display items and cartoonish misogyny have not only
made him famous, but it has also put the spotlight on the internet
manosphere. Tate is viewed as the extreme expression of a lifestyle that
is free of all cultural coercion. It is not that the pickup artist lives
solely to sate his appetites. It is that he rejects all of the
conventions of society with regards to how a man should live. By
conventions, they always mean the highly feminized rules and the modern
West.

It is more than a bit ironic that the people who have been gnawing away
at conventional sex roles in order to liberate women are now up in arms
over men doing the same thing, but for the purpose of liberating men. It
also speaks to the feminization of Western societies that the people
seeking liberation from cultural norms are young males hoping to prey on
women raised on feminism. Women were liberated so that liberated males
can treat them like prostitutes.

To further add to the irony, much of the modern left-wing liberation
movement is about freeing nonwhites from cultural coercion. You see,
according to woke theory, nonwhites can never truly be free until they
eradicate white power structures. These are defined as the norms of
Western society. Of course, one of those norms used to be how males
should behave toward females. It looks like the woke would like to keep
some of the old white power structure they claim to oppose.

That gets to the heart of the matter. Andrew Tate is not a man. He is a
caricature of what it means to be a man. He is what second wave feminist
called a chauvinist, a male who defines himself by minimizing women.
Back in the heyday of second wave feminism, such men existed mostly in
the agitated imaginations of recently divorced women, but now thanks to
the miracle of the internet, they are legion. Feminism literally created
what it claimed to oppose.

The reason these internet personalities specializing in the art of
exploiting women have grown in number is they appeal to the young male’s
natural rebelliousness. Those old white power structures used to have
systems for young males to “sow their wild oats” and then settle into
the normal routine of being a responsible man. Those have been wrecked
by feminism. It turns out that there is little point in being a
responsible man when the women are not good at being women.

In fairness, feminism would never have gone anywhere if ruling class
males had done their duty and maintained the old ways. The bourgeois
society that arose in the 20th century, especially in America, brought
bourgeois degeneracy with it. Over the course of the 20th century,
America and then the West has come to be defined by the coffee house
radical seeking new ways to stand out from tradition and custom.
Feminism and the pickup artist are two manifestations of this process.

Interestingly, both Andrew Tate and his woke feminist critics are right.
From his perspective, the hedonistic lifestyle built around the
exploitation of liberated women is completely rational. If modern
society has no rewards for playing the traditional male role, if in fact
it punishes those who play that role, then logic says the male should
reject that role and seek profit where he can find it. Biologically that
means getting as much high status stuff and as many females as possible.

The woke feminists are also correct in pointing out that males living
outside the feminist cultural norms are a direct threat to their
existence. Modern bourgeois society depends upon males playing the
traditional roles in key areas, while the ruling class free rides off of
their efforts. It is a parasitic relationship that can only work if the
males among the Dirt People play along with it. The lifestyle of Andrew
Tate threatens the balance between the host and the parasite.

Of course, no society can survive if the males are like Andrew Tate and
the females are like his woke feminist critics. To be a man is to be
trusted by other men to keep safe that which is important to men. Andrew
Tate cannot be trusted around your women or your belongings, so he is
not a man. In a crisis, the first thing that happens is the men in
charge kill the guys like Andrew Tate. It is addition by subtraction.
Not having to worry about him leaves time for important matters.

Similarly, the woke feminists will disappear in a crisis. In fact, all
forms of feminism will disappear as soon as things get serious again.
For starters, the men in charge will have no patience for it. Like
Andrew Tate, some nag complaining about the unfairness of biology is an
unnecessary distraction. The responsible females will quickly move in to
put a muzzle on these women. When the crisis comes, look for mobs of
middle-aged mothers reviving the ducking stool.

In the end, Andrew Tate and his woke feminist antagonists are both
products of the carny morality that springs from bourgeois society. Free
to indulge in their worst instincts, a bourgeois ruling class will do
their worst and then seek to normalize it among the people over whom the
rule. Like the people who live the life of excess, a society ruled this
way ends in physical and mental despair. Like the man of excess, a
society of excess eventually needs an intervention.
