this week will naturally be about the installation of The Pretender onto
the throne. I also have

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the military begins the process of installing The Pretender as the
figurative leader of the American Empire, it is a good time to take
stock of what has happened over the last five years. From the
perspective of political psychology, the world all of us inhabit today
is a vastly different one from the world of 2015. This includes the
dissident right, which has been transformed by the Trump experience. In
the before times, politics was all shades of gray, while today it is in
black and white.

An obvious example is Conservative Inc. The Obama years were tough for
those rackets, as it became clear to many conservative people that these
guys cared more about how the Left thought of them than in advancing
their issues. Compounding it was the refusal to address the failures of
the Bush years. Even so, they really thought they could keep peddling
hyper-violent Progressivism to conservatives, as long as they decorated
it with pictures of Reagan.

That racket smashed onto the rocks of the Trump experience. Traffic for
the old school neocon sites collapsed. The Weekly Standard folded. These
people revealed themselves to be a blend of old school confidence men
and petulant, nasty liars who hate the people they claim to represent.
They still have an audience of chumps unable to smarten up, but
otherwise Conservative Inc. has no audience. They exist because the Left
thinks they are useful for now.

Further to that point, Libertarian Inc., a subsidiary of Conservative
Inc., has also been exposed as a long con. The stripping of our ancient
liberties by global enterprise should have been a great cause for
libertarians. After all, systematically stripping people of their
ability to exist is pretty much what libertarians claim to oppose, but
the major organs were silent. A combination of graft and perfidy kept
them focused on echoing Progressive talking points about the evil Donald
Trump.

This has revealed something else. The dissident right is not ready to be
the Dissident Right, despite the growing numbers. This is a problem that
dates to the 1980’s when Conservative Inc. started to purge dissenters
from their ranks. Instead of working to build new structures outside of
and opposed to official structures, dissidents kept trying to get back
inside the official tent. The result has been a ragtag army living on
the land outside the walls of the city. It remains so.

Probably the biggest change, one we see evolving in front of our eyes as
the military is called in to install The Pretender, is that the parties
are a fiction. Until very recent, most dissidents thought the way
forward was to work through the two-party system and get “our guys” into
office. Again, this dates to the 1980’s. Buchanan tried and failed to
unseat the neocon Bush. Perot tried and failed with his third-party to
cleanse the land of the neocons. Trump tried and failed to reform the
Republican Party.

The reason all these efforts failed is the party system is a fiction.
The core of each party holds the same opinions on the important issues.
They are bankrolled by the same collection of billionaires and
international interests. The parties have tentacles that reach into
various camps, but the main body of the system serves the people who
bankroll American politics. A politician with close ties to the CCP can
maintain his seat because the Chinese are a major backer of both
parties.

This is the big change for dissidents. Trump was the last opportunity to
keep dissidents engaged in the fiction of democracy. His own perfidy and
his treatment by the political class has disabused dissidents of their
faith in the system. The people in the streets at the Epiphany Uprising
were not there because they still believe in the Republican Party,
Donald Trump, or the system itself. They were there, being cheered by
tens of millions from home, because dissidents lost their faith in the
system.

Further to that, it is finally dawning on dissidents that what motivates
the Cloud People is not what motivates the Dirt People. For generations,
the Right insisted that the Left is driven by the same logic as everyone
else. This was always false, and part of the long con played on the
public. This is, in part, why conservatives lost every battle in the
culture war. The people on the other side of the barricades, celebrating
their victory over us, are not us and they do not think like us.

This is probably the most important lesson of the last five years that
is finally sinking into the thick skulls of the dissident right. The
Cloud People are not motivated by greed or a lust for power. They have
those things. They are motivated by a sense of identity that starts with
a hatred of the Dirt People. Their sense of self begins with not being
anything like the people over whom they rule. This is why they hated
Trump. He was an intruder from the other side injected into their world.

While many are disappointed with the Trump years and Donald Trump the
man, the last five years have been a clarifying experience. The anger,
emotion, disappointment, frustration, even the violence, are the result
of a fog lifting. Five years ago, most people were sure about politics.
Now that the fog has lifted, people are looking around and seeing it was
always a big lie. The people who perpetrated these lies are on the other
side of those barricades, giving the rest of us the finger.
