The show is back this week and fair warning, it is not a great show.
Like a lot of people, I am now in summer mode. Last summer was cancelled
by our rulers and their Chinese handlers, so I am looking forward to
having summer this year. I am not a summer person, but I do like the
slower pace. Here in Lagos, the masks are dropping and the bareface is
running free again, so it is feeling very summery all of a sudden. Even
the homicide rate has got back to normal. Past normal actually.

It has been interesting watching the struggle for normalcy. At the
stores, about 60% of people still wears masks, depending upon where you
go. The ghetto was hit and miss on the masks all along, but the
beautiful people places were energetically compliant with the masking
and distancing. That is where you see the strongest resistance to the
dropping of the masks. I suspect the mask could become a piety symbol
for these people, which would be a good result of the Covid panic.

The workplace is where things are getting weird already. I was on a call
with a client the other day and they are still doing the work at home
thing. The boss wants everyone back, but he has been getting a ton of
resistance. The plan is everyone has until the fall to get back to the
office. I know a couple of women who are quitting rather than go back to
the office, as they like being home with the kids. They realized that
extra stuff and having a career was not a good trade-off.

In my office building, I would say close to half the tenants will not
renew. Some went out of business, but others figured out that they could
save the rent and let their people work from home, so that is the plan.
There is a lot of vacant office space in this part of the world, so
commercial real estate is heading for a long recession. That is a
cyclical business anyway, so it probably does not matter. A few years
ago, we were the only tenant in our building for a few months.

It is easy to see why the Covidians are fighting the return to normalcy.
There will be no way to do pull this stuff again after people drop the
masks and go back to living relatively normal lives again. They can
scream themselves hoarse about variants and new waves, but there is no
going back to masks now. The fact that Florida exists has discredited
this forever. The Covidians will have to find a new reason to justify
tormenting the public so they can feel like heroes.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
