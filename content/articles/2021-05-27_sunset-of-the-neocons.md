One of the more interesting developments of the last half dozen years is
the collapse of the old neoconservative order. By the Bush years it was
no longer possible to question the presence of these people at the heart
of conservativism, but a little over a decade on and the neocons are
happy to exclude themselves from the Right. More important, they seem to
be unambitiously antiwhite now. That was always the subtext of paleocon
criticism of them, but now they are happy to confirm it.

It is as if someone blew a whistle that only the neocons could hear, and
they abandoned their former friends on the Right. Look around
conservative media and it has been like a weird form of the rapture. One
by one they have disappeared from Fox News, National Review, and other
conservative outlets. They have quietly tapped into hidden wealth to
start up new outlets like the Bulwark and the Dispatch. Others have
moved onto the pages of far-left scandal sheets like the New York Times.

The thing is this departure has not just been a change of direction for
them or an adaptation to new reality. These new sites are not an effort
to build a better mouse trap or find new intellectual freedom. In fact,
they are not trying to influence right-wing discourse at all. Instead,
they are at war with their former friends, desperately trying to prevent
anything like a right-wing from emerging from the tumult. They are
anti-Trump, anti-populist and most important, anti-white.

Again, this was always the claim from critics. The first generation of
neocons started out in life as Trotskyites and transformed into
conservatives when the Left started saying nice things about their
ancient enemies. There was also the Israel question. The Left was siding
with nonwhites, like Palestinians, while the Buckley crowd was happy to
side with the Israelis. The neocon phenomenon was a marriage of
convenience for the first generation and has suddenly become
inconvenient.

Neoconservatism has not collapsed, of course, as they are like a drug
resistant virus or an invasive species. Short of a nuclear holocaust,
there appears to be no way to eradicate them. Given the track record of
the neocons, they should have gone to the trash heap of history a long
time ago. They are responsible for the worst presidency in modern
American history. Somehow, as if by magic, they have found new hosts and
carry on as if everyone else is to blame for their failures.

What is most amazing about all of this is the mask dropping. Back in the
Trump years, Jonah Goldberg amplified every left-wing criticism of
Trump. He was also enthusiastic about calling Trump voters every
left-wing epithet he could remember from his days working for Ben
Wattenberg, the old Bolshevik TV presenter. Bill Kristol, of course,
sounded like one of screeching harpies from the Daily Beast. His bizarre
outbursts and predictions suggested he was having a psychotic break.

It was not just an over-reaction to Trump. The mean old orange man is
gone and there is no rapprochement between the neocons and their former
friends. If anything, the neocons are getting more aggressive. This <a
href="https://cathy.arcdigital.media/p/cancel-culture-hypocrisy-and-double"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from Cathy Young is a good
recent example of the neocon war on the conservatives. She manages to
weave together the familiar paranoid delusions about antisemitism with
left-wing conspiracy theories into an indictment of conservatives as
hypocrites.

It was not so long ago that Cathy Young pitched herself as a
right-libertarian, posting at Reason, National Review, the Federalist
and so forth. Everything about her was a fraud, including her name, but
she was able to fool Conservative Inc. The fact that she warms herself
on a large rock every morning should have tipped them off, but
conservatives are not known for noticing these things. Still, her
shifting into an antiwhite bigot at war with conservatives is a telling
transformation.

The question that naturally arises is why have they suddenly abandoned
the old host, despite not having a new host? Perhaps the assumption is
that after a clear separation they will be welcomed by the Left. This is
something a pupa stage for them. The next stage is the imago when they
will mature into left-wing warmongers. Many of them do still pose as
conservatives at left-wing tabloids like the Washington Post. Jennifer
Ruben and Brett Stephens are two examples.

Of course, there is the possibility that intellectual decline has hit
them hard. Read the first generation neocons and there is no missing
their intellect. These were smart and shrewd men with the animal cunning
of revolutionaries. Their descendants, in contrast, are obnoxiously
dull-witted. Bill Kristol spent his life as a freeloader, cashing in on
his father’s reputation. Jonah Goldberg made armpit noises as the house
jester for National Review, before declaring himself an intellectual.

This is something that cannot be dismissed. David French is the house
intellectual at Goldberg’s Dispatch. Tucker Carlson nailed it when he
said, “David French is a buffoon, one of the least impressive people
I’ve ever met. Only in nonprofit conservatism could he have a paying
job.” This is true across the neocon spectrum. Recall this is a crew
that seriously considered running <a
href="https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/mcmullinevan8-8-16abcnews.jpg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Evan McMullen</a> for president. For
those in need of some clown horn, here is <a
href="https://reason.com/2016/10/14/evan-mcmullin-could-tip-the-election-so/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">more</a> on that topic.

The other possibility is that neoconservatism was always a long con, but
it has finally run out of road. The disastrous Bush years brought this
reality to the fore and the neocons had no willingness or ability to
answer for it. Eric Hoffer pointed out that mass movements in America
end up as a racket, a cult, or a corporation. In the case of the neocons
it is just a racket now. They are happy to run the pro-Israel racket as
long as it keeps them in the lifestyle they believe they deserve.

Regardless of the the causes, the slow death of neoconservatism is a net
positive for right-thinking people. The reason conservatism was a
disaster is it cloaked anti-Western sentiment in liberal principle. The
neocons were always the quintessential wolf in sheep’s clothing, so
their departure offers clarity. That is, the people on the Right can now
think in terms of their own interests, rather than the interests of
esoteric principles or carefully cultivated and ennobled outsiders.
