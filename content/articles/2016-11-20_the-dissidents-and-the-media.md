Back in the 80’s, one of the more irritating things about following
politics was watching stupid Republicans walk onto liberal news programs
and get ambushed. It was if they were just made aware of the fact that
the Left never plays fair. It was not just Republican politicians.
Conservative chatters would also fall into these traps. It was very
frustrating until I figured out that it was all a show. The
“conservative” was hired to play a role in the drama. George Will, in
private, thought you people were gross and disgusting.

This model persisted through the 90’s and it was only when Fox News came
on-line did we see some fair treatment of people outside the Progressive
orbit. Even there, the obsession with being fair often resulted in being
stupid. Exactly no one gives a crap what Juan Williams has to say about
anything. Yet, FNC felt they needed to decorate the set with him. Even
so, it was just one outlet among many so the prevailing model was a
Progressive gang-up on anyone not professing the One True Faith.

What made it most infuriating is that so-called conservatives would go
on moonbat networks and do taped shows. The producers would then cut up
the recording to make the conservative sound nutty or unresponsive. When
confronted, the so-called conservative would admit to knowing it was a
setup, but they would say they did it to try and change minds. In
reality they were just taking the check. The boys and girls from
Official Conservatism™ on the payroll of PBS and CNN were taking a dive
on purpose so they could get paid.

It’s why the Tea Party was doomed from the start. When guys like Dick
Army got involved, you knew it as a con. More important, the organizers
were clawing each other’s eyes out trying to get on TV. These were not
people motivated by a cause. They were motivated by the desire to be
famous and hang around green rooms with the Lefties they saw on
television. Those are people easy to corrupt so it was just a matter of
*when*, not *if*, they sold out their people, which most promptly did
for short money.

What has always been encouraging about Trump is he seems to get this. He
has done almost no taped interviews and he avoided private interviews
with news sites like the NYTimes and Washington Post. In the former
case, he knew they would edit the hell out of his interview because he
saw it first hand doing his TV shows. In the latter case, he knew these
people were not honest. They lie on spec and giving them a private
interview would only enable them make up fake news about Trump.

Trump’s live events were big enough to require coverage, but he put the
media in pens so they could not pretend to be talking to Nazis and
Klansmen in the crowd. The only thing they could do was show the video
and moan about it. You also note that Trump uses lots of hand gestures
when speaking. He never used to do this, but I suspect he started doing
it because it makes editing impossible. As you can see in this Breitbart
story, editing is now the main tool of the media.

In other words, live interview make it hard to fake the interview. In
the Reagan years, the press complained that Reagan sat for few taped
interviews and he preferred giving speeches to be covered live. Trump
seems to have learned this and taken it to another level with the use of
social media. What he was able to do is keep the media on the wrong
foot, always playing defense, even when they thought they had him, like
with the fake bimbo stories. By being unpredictable, he was impossible
to script.

It’s a good lesson for the Dissidents doing interviews on Lefty media.
Avoid anything that is taped and only do live interviews. Supporting
media that supports you has a corollary. Don’t support media that is at
war with you. If you are at an event, just ignore the people with
cameras and microphones. When you see people claiming to be prominent
members of the alt-right, for example, begging to be on CNN or FNC, it
is a safe bet that they are just in it for the money and you would be
wise to tune them out and drop them from your rotation.
