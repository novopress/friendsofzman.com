How best to govern a diverse population is a part of the subtext of
public political debates in America, mostly because no one is permitted
to debate the orthodoxy on immigration, so America gets more diverse
every day. This is treated as a novelty that only the best minds in the
managerial elite can tackle. In reality, humans have been dealing with
diversity since the first human settlements. It turns out that there are
only five solutions to the problem posed by diversity.

The most common way of dealing with the problem of diversity is also the
oldest way of dealing with diversity. That is for the dominant tribe to
subjugate or even eradicate the alien tribes from their land. The people
of one place finally get the upper hand over the people adjacent to them
and wipe them out. Alternatively, the main identity group in the newly
formed society compels the minorities to adopt their identity. Wiping
out diversity is the oldest cure for diversity.

The trouble is it rarely works, especially when you are dealing with
large numbers of people in tight communities. The Israelis are trying to
drive off the Arabs in Gaza, even going so far as to deliberately
massacre civilians, but they are no closer to pushing out the Arabs than
when they started their genocidal campaign against them. Even with
modern tools, it is extremely hard to remove a large population. It is
possible, but in this age, even the Israelis cannot get away with it.

That leaves the four more civilized options. One is to simply keep the
various identity groups apart to reduce friction. This was common in the
northern cities of the United States into the 20th century. The old
neighborhood system that is romanticized today used to be rigorously
policed by the authorities to make sure blacks were not going into
Italian areas and vice-versa. Keeping the peace meant keeping the groups
as separate as possible from one another.

In the South there was a soft version of segregation. Diversity
primarily meant blacks, who were systematically segregated from whites
in largely symbolic ways. Blacks and whites could share public spaces,
but had to maintain separation, even if it were mostly symbolic like
riding in the back of the bus. This performative segregation was to
reinforce the notion that the two races could never mix. Segregation
became a habit of mind, rather than physical separation.

Both of those effective and popular systems were overthrown by the
managerial elite in favor of the chaos of the present. This system does
not have a catchy name, like segregation or Jim Crow, but
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=8318" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">proportionalism</a> will do. The system of rights that
had been the basis of America society was abandoned in favor of
egalitarian ideals to which the elites make exceptions in order to
achieve what they arbitrarily see as a proportional outcome among the
various tribes of America.

The growing tyranny that must come from such a system is what is driving
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/JX8c3nf37xA" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">academic debates</a> about the civil rights revolution
and the <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">rear guard action</a> to hold the line against DIE
programs in the institutions. Of course, the people responsible for this
disaster are not interested in altering course. They are especially
uninterested in the fourth option which is to not manage the diversity
at all. This was the way America managed diversity through most of the
19th century.

A good example of this is in this interesting <a
href="https://lawliberty.org/book-review/cultivating-the-american-life/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about an old house by one of the
professors in that linked video. He bought an old farmhouse and got
curious about its history, so he did the research. It turns out that his
house has a diverse history that reflects the way diversity was managed
in early America. Basically, people were left to sort themselves out as
best they could, which generally meant peaceful separation when peaceful
cohabitation was not possible.

As pointed out in that post, who people are, in terms of their primary
identity, is how they live, and no amount of downward force can change
it. This is why the path of proportionalism as practiced by our tyrants
must lead to that first and oldest option for dealing with diversity.
They are trying to wipe out whiteness, by which they mean white people,
through a campaign of cultural genocide, along with the importation of
nonwhites in numbers no society can sustain.

The trouble is that wiping out even a small minority is difficult.
Purging America of “whiteness” when most of the population is white and
determined to live as they prefer, in the teeth of the cultural pogroms,
is impossible. This brings us to the irreconcilable contradiction that
lies at the heart of the current crisis. For the ruling elite to remain
the currently constructed ruling elite they must continue with
proportionalism, even though it must fail and lead to their eventual
overthrow.

What all of this points to is both a solution to the current tyrannical
regime and the challenge of diversity. Because whites will remain the
largest population and will increase their self-segregation in response
to their shrinking majority and the cultural assault on them from the
elites, the racial tyranny must collapse. Put another way, the old
solution of self-sorting, the habit of frontier America, will be the
rocks upon which the racial tyrants will be destroyed.

This may seem overly optimistic, but the reality is the current regime
is fighting human nature, which is undefeated in fights of this sort.
Ideology, and the racialized politics of this age are ideological, is
hostile to human nature. Communism did not fail due to technical errors.
It failed because it was inhuman. The same is true of the racial
ideology of the managerial class. Peaceful separation is the natural
state of Americans, and it will be it natural order again.
