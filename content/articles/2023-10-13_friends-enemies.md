This past week has been an interesting display of mask dropping by many
people who have been courting nationalist and populist audiences. As
soon as word got out about the Hamas attack, these people immediately
reverted to their nature. Social media was like a time machine, taking
everyone back to the heady days when it was okay to express some
strictly approved hate to the other.

It has been a good example of how people with an agenda can wear your
politics like a costume if it furthers their cause. Ben Shapiro will
tell you whatever you want to hear as long as you unquestionably support
Zionism. Maybe you get some positive noises from his big megaphones, but
in the end, his cause will always come before anything he has to tell
you in order to get you to support his cause.

Does it help our side if a duplicitous reptile like Ben Shapiro voices
opposition to the Left on some issues, but then comes out guns blazing,
pointed mostly at our side, when he wants unconditional support for his
people? It is not an easy answer. There is no doubt that his operation
did some good work on the tranny business, but now he is demanding all
that be put aside for another war on behalf of his people.

The Charles Haywood formula would suggest it is best to ignore Shapiro
right now, rather than publicly oppose him. No enemies on the right, as
Haywood states it, means everyone focus on the main quest, not the side
quests. On the other hand, is Ben Shapiro really on the Right? Does he
honestly oppose the Left on the things that matter to the genuine
opposition? That is an important question.

That is the gist of the show this week. I wrote about this, and I got
some interesting feedback, so I thought I would expand on it in the
show. Partisanship is not something that comes easy to the Right. There
is a natural empiricism to any politics that opposes what we call the
Left. That works against partisanship, which often demands accepting the
inaccurate in pursuit of larger goals.
