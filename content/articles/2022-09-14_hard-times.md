**Note:** The comments have been getting bombed by Ukrainian bots, which
is why moderation has been so immoderate. This was part of the public
relations campaign around the recent offensive. It is slowly abating,
but for now moderation will remain tight to prevent a flood of nutty
comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The American stock exchanges dropped sharply yesterday when it was
announced that the inflation reduction act had not reduced inflation.
The consumer price index came in higher than expected. This triggered
the robots to sell on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep
tightening the money supply. The DOW dropped 3.94% bringing the decline
for the year to 14.4%. Luckily, they have changed the definition of a
bear market so this is still a bull market.

The inflation report was all bad news. Gasoline prices declined ten
percent, but all other energy increased for the period. That probably
means two things. One is the gas price decline is due to less driving.
In other words, people are adjusting their spending because inflation is
not starting to take a bite out of their budgets. Instead of a weekend
car trip, people are staying home. According to
[AAA](https://gasprices.aaa.com/declining-gas-demand-and-oil-prices-push-national-average-down-again/),
over all sales of gasoline declined in August to levels last seen during
the lockdowns.

Another piece of the gasoline puzzle is the dumping of cheap crude on
the domestic refineries by the Biden administration. They panicked when
gasoline hit five bucks a gallon nationally so they started releasing
crude from the SPR. This drives down the price of gasoline a little. The
taps run dry at the end of next month, just before the election, so
prices will tick back up. In other words, some of the bad news has been
pushed out to after the November elections.

The reaction to the inflation report is a good example of how the people
in charge believe their own narratives. The never ending debate on this
side of the great divide is whether they believe their nonsense. When it
comes to the economy, they can talk themselves into anything. They had
Biden out bragging about the good economy just when the report was
released, on their assumption that it would be the proof they needed to
go along with his speech. Whoops.

This also ties in nicely with the orchestrated media campaign in August
claiming that Joe Biden was leading his party to victory in November.
They rolled out a bunch of polls along with pleasing narratives about
specific races. Of course, they claimed that abortion was killing the
Republicans with voters. The narrative said the economy was catching
fire, inflation was falling and this would result in the most popular
man in history leading his party to a smashing success.

Putting that aside, inflation is the second worst thing that can happen
in an economy, the worst being deflation. There is a debate about where
the sweet spot is with prices, but everyone agrees that anything outside
the two percent range is bad. The Fed targets two percent inflation. The
sound money guys think a two percent decline in prices is the right
target. Right now inflation is at eight percent using the current model
and double that using the [old
model](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts).

That last bit is key. We have been lying to ourselves about inflation
since the 1990’s and it is obvious when you look at old bills. Pull out
a cable bill from ten years ago and you see the difference. Food is
probably twice what it was ten years ago. Ten years ago, people were
complaining about two dollar home heating oil. In places with real
winter, oil contracts are around five bucks a gallon now. This has been
over a period when they say inflation was around two percent.

The subtext to this is the politics. The reckless behavior of the ruling
class made people angry enough to vote for Trump when times were good.
When people are worried about [buying
food](https://apnews.com/article/hungerfoodbanksinflation-4fd5d6fb5879eaecc3000fe2b73df006),
they tend to get a bit cranky. This hits the middle-class even more as
they are riddled with angst. Poor people accept that they may have to
stand in line for food, but middle-class people loath the idea of it. It
is why we hide food banks from the middle-class, so they are not freaked
out about it.

A suddenly panicked middle-class, still not happy about the 2020
election or the behavior of the elites, might start looking around for
something a bit stronger than Trump and his one-liners. Whether that is
happening or not does not matter, as the regime will assume it is
happening. That is why the administration is sending goons out to rough
up political opponents. Just as they were sure inflation was a social
construct, they are sure the invisible Hitler army is angry over
inflation.

This is probably why Russia and China are so confident about their
prospects in this global economic war. They look at Europe and see an
economic and political circus that is about to get very bad. In the
United States, all the signs point to the last days of an empire in
decline. Realistically, they are not wrong. America has been broken for
a long time and now it is going broke. That is why countries like India
and Saudi Arabia are not siding with the empire in the war against
Russia.

Putting that aside, the news is all bad right now as far as the economy.
The Federal Reserve has no choice but to keep raising rates. They should
have moved faster and earlier, but Powell is doing his Arthur Burns
impression. He was the Fed chief in the 1970’s who dithered while
inflation raged. Powell seems to be finding his inner Volcker so that
means tight money and that means recession. Just how deep is the only
question that matters at this point.
