It’s easy to dismiss the warnings about what’s coming, lots of people
do, arguing that only the wildly pessimistic think we’re headed for
serious trouble. <a

pessimistic about what’s coming.

The assertion that an image caused this lunatic to have a seizure is so
ridiculous, that it is impossible to assume the authorities believe it.
Even if such a thing were remotely possible, it means we will need to
build a lot of new prisons. If posting certain images is not a criminal
act solely because someone claims harm, this ends with everyone accusing
everyone of a criminal act. The fact is, the FBI is just harassing this
guy because they want to send a message. That message is you better get
permission before you speak.
