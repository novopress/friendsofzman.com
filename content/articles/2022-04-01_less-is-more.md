The show this week is a follow up to the show last week. The original
idea was to cover all of this in one show, but that would take more than
an hour. I decided to split it up and do the second half in response to
the expected complaints to the first part. We live in a post-liberal
age, so we have to start thinking that way. First, we consider the
liberal arguments about rights or political ideas and then look at it in
the context of the present age and the history that led us to this
point.

This really is the dissident project. Criticizing the current order is
important and necessary, but there has to be an alternative. That does
not mean we spend our days working on 25-point plans for after the
revolution. Instead, we need to think about why the liberal order failed
and then imagine how it could have been designed to withstand the
assaults that caused the failure. The fact is the people who undermined
the liberal order did so using specific tactics and strategies.

Of course, this leads to the question of what is possible in this age. A
topic that will come up more and more in dissident circles is what kind
of society is possible in a majority-minority world? What kind of
America is possible in a multi-polar world where the state is limited by
how much it can tax the people? That is a vastly different world from
where we are now. Few people alive have lived in an America with a
ruling class constrained by the limits of taxation.

The answer may be that no coherent society is possible on a continent
full of people with radically different cultural perspectives. It is
hard for most people to imagine, but the end of the Global American
Empire could turn out to be a North America fragmented like post-Roman
Spain. Sudden poverty and the collapse of legitimate authority could
shatter the continent. The result could be a great reordering around the
general features that define the current population.

It is a big topic, but the place to start is the small items. Speech is
a good topic because it touches on all of these items. It is also why
the subversives have always focused on speech as their lever to unsettle
society. Once you start to declare certain things off-limits you
inevitably are determining who decides. This is where the bad guys
inserted themselves into the bloodstream of American society. They
became the deciders and the results show that to be the great American
mistake.
