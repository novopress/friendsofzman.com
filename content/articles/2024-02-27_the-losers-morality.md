sure, but a reality of life these days.

On Sunday, a US Air Force member named Aaron Bushnell set himself on
fire outside the Israel embassy to protest the war in Gaza. This being
the modern age, he live steamed the act on Twitch. According to the
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68405119"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>, he had e-mailed a message to the
Antifa media operators with whom he was associated. “Today, I am
planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of
the Palestinian people,” the email read, warning it would be “highly
disturbing”.

The video is disturbing for a number of reasons, the most obvious of
which it shows a man burning to death, which is one of the most horrific
ways to die. It also shows uniformed police doing nothing but pointing
their guns at the man as he burned to death, because that is the only
thing they know how to do now. Finally, someone rushed up with a fire
extinguisher to put out the flames, but the cops still stood there ready
to shoot the poor man if they could find a reason to do it.

The point of this act was to get attention to the cause, which is the
Israeli war on the Palestinian settlements in Gaza. Antifa, with whom
Mr. Bushnell was associated, is anti-Israel, so they have taken up the
cause of Gaza. Despite claiming to be antifascist, the anarchist
subculture is surprisingly antisemitic, something that gets left out of
the reporting by the media. It is a good example of how the Washington
regime will align with anyone, no matter how bizarre, if it suits their
needs.

The logic behind this protest is that it so shocks the sensibilities
that no one can ignore it, thus attention is brought to the cause. There
is no disputing this. Before Aaron Bushnell self-immolated, no one other
than his family and friends had any reason to know his name, but now he
is global news. To a lesser degree, his reasons for doing what he did
are also global news. For the anti-Israel movement around the world,
Aaron Bushnell is now a martyr and hero for the cause.

That is where things get complicated. For those already in the pro-Gaza
camp, Mr. Bushnell’s actions are noble because they elicit pity. Michael
Tracy <a href="https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1762326606108836308"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">tried</a> unsuccessfully to make this
point on Twitter. You are supposed to see the act, feel pity for the man
suffering and then think about his reasoning. Presumably, once you
understand his reasoning, you will not only embrace his reasoning, but
embrace the moral claims that he is making with regards to Israel.

Of course, you could just as easily look at his act, feel pity for the
man and then conclude he must be insane. After all, reason tells us that
all living creators seek to preserve their lives by any means necessary.
This we can observe in nature and within ourselves as living things.
Therefore, a human seeking to die is probably suffering from mental
defect and needs protection from himself. Perhaps his cause is just as
crazy as the man killing himself in the name of the cause.

There is something else. Why should the moral claims of a loser, a
failure, a maniac, have greater appeal than the moral claims of the
people supporting the stronger party in the Gaza conflict? In other
words, why do the losers have a claim on our sympathy rather than the
winners? Why should our sympathy have any role in determining the
morality of the two parties in the conflict? Why are both sides
appealing to our pity and sympathy rather than some other emotion?

In no other area of life is this logic applied. In a war the winners are
celebrated and the losers are punished, usually by their own people.
When the Ukraine army falls apart, the political leaders of Ukraine will
flee for their lives. The leaders of NATO countries will be mocked and
scorned by their own people. We see the same in sports competition,
where the winners are feted and the losers and excoriated. Why in this
case should the morality be turned on its head?

The truth is, it is not turned on its head. The reason this sort of
protest, and most protests, fail to sway the public is they appeal to a
loser’s morality. The protestors are saying, in effect, that they cannot
win the debate with the public and they cannot win the argument with the
rulers. They are powerless, so no one addresses their concerns, which
leaves them with nothing by an appeal to your sympathy. This always
fails as people naturally support the winner and reject the loser.

This is why most of the commentary online about the self-immolation of
Aaron Bushnell was mocking and joking. Even in that Michael Tracey
thread the replies are sarcastic, despite his obvious appeal to pity. It
turns out that appeals to pity only work on those who see themselves as
pitiful. To everyone else, they just reinforce the notion that the
losers deserve to lose, which is why they act like losers. For most
people, Bushnell’s act proves his cause is not worth considering.

It is an important point about politics. Democratic politics are theater
and self-pity makes for bad box office. Successful political movements
project strength and confidence, not weakness and self-pity. That means
all public displays, including protests, should project strength and
confidence. Aaron Bushnell would have served his cause better if he went
about punching Israelis in the nose. At least then he would have been
seen as a threat and people will respect a man who is a threat.
