When one era ends and another begins is always a hot topic for
historians and academics, because history does not make it easy. The old
staggers on for a long time, despite it having become pointless or
exhausted. The new is not always ready to take center stage, so it is
never clear as to when it started. It is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sorites Paradox</a>. Just as
we know there is a point where grains of sand eventually become a heap,
we know one epoch gives way to another, but exactly when is impossible
to say.

Of course, while you are in such a transition period, it is even more
difficult to know when the old has finally receded into the past and
when the new has begun. History is full of false starts and false
transitions. Ideologues are always sure the great transition is right
around the corner. For the people living through a transition, it just
feels like a “great muddling through” for those aware of what’s
happening. For the rest it is just the way things are, as they try to
not to think about such things.

Whether we are in such a great transition is hard to know for certain,
but people who think of such things are thinking about it. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This paper</a> on how NATO can
adapt to the populist era is such an example. It is written by
<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Jeff Giesea</a>, someone who has been on the edges of
populist politics in America. The focus on the paper in how NATO can
adapt to the rise of populism in Europe in order to maintain itself and
address some of the issues that give rise to populist movements.

NATO is a great example of why marking the end of one period and the
start of the next is so difficult, especially for the people living
through it. The senior administrative staff in NATO probably started
their careers in the Cold War. Many of the senior political leaders in
the West are still people who came of age in that era. NATO has already
outlived the Cold War and now may be outliving the age of globalism. It
is a legacy institution that still staggers on for no obvious reason.

That’s why they invest time and money thinking about how the institution
can adapt to the new age, whatever one calls it. What started as a
temporary alliance among Western nations to guard against Soviet
aggression in Europe, is now a permanent part of the European landscape.
It’s like a union job or a government contract. No one wants to see it
end. The Red Army is long gone, but NATO remains ready for them if they
ever reappear on the European Plain.

It is a good example of the problems of post-nationalism. NATO was
always a national entity, designed to defend nations. In a world without
borders, having a military organization built for defending borders
makes little sense. Critics of the organization always point to the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but the bigger problem for NATO is that it
is rooted in the concept of sovereign nations. Each member contributes
men, material, bases and money to maintain a joint military force.

In a world where European countries don’t have control of control over
their own budgets and cannot mint their own coins, how can they possibly
have an active voice in a military alliance? Italy, for example, has to
get permission from Brussels to operate a new landfill or power plant.
The EU regulates the acceptable size of bananas and how much can be
spent on picking up dog droppings. Globalism reduced nations to
dependents with no agency of their own.

NATO also underscores a hidden truth about globalism and that is it only
exists because the American empire exists. NATO exist because America
keeps it going. If America ever started acting like a real country
again, it would abandon legacy entities like NATO, as they serve no
national interest. The same is true about globalism. The EU has been
allowed to flourish, because it enjoys American protection. Take that
protection away and Europe returns to a continent of nations.

It’s also an example of how the people muddling through a transition
period may be all wrong about what they are noticing. The conventional
wisdom says the world is transitioning from nationalism to
post-nationalism. Global entities will supplant nation states and global
corporations will manage the global economy. These populist uprisings we
see in the West are just rearguard actions by those who will not be part
of the glorious multicultural global paradise that is tomorrow.

In reality, we may be living through the opposite. The Cold War era may
have been the globalist era, dominated by two great democratic empires.
On the one side was the democracy of communism. On the other was the
democracy of natural rights. First the Soviet Empire collapsed and now
the American Empire is receding. The flurry of cosmopolitan globalism is
not a rearguard action, but more like the scavengers profiting from the
end of that great epoch in Western history.

What is called populism today is simply the West waking up from the long
slumber that was the great battle between two empires. Generations of
Europeans sublimating national interests for a common defense are now
waking up from that period to assert those interests again. In the US,
regional and now racial interests that have long been suppressed are
bubbling up to the surface. Just as NATO is an entity from a bygone era,
cosmopolitan globalism is the echo of a bygone age.
