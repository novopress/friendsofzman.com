One of the things I think will be very interesting to watch over the
next decade is the breakup of the cable monopolies. By that I mean the
end of forced subsidies through the cable bill. I doubt we ever see
multiple cable outfits servicing the same area. What we wil see in most
areas is at least one satellite operator, a cable provider, a fiber
company and a wireless company offering combinations of voice and data.
TV will be offered as a part of the data package as just another
internet service. Consumers will shop the providers based on their
needs. Metered service will become common.

As is always the case, some areas will have several choices, while
others have one or two options. A big city like New York will not have
DirecTV, but Boise Idaho will not have fiber or cellular. More
important, the content  will be unbundled from the pipe. Instead of
paying Comcast $120 a month for TV and Internet, you will pay Comcast
$50 a month and buy the content you  want from a broker or the
originator.

The content providers are fighting this hammer and tong. The reason is
they are currently making hundreds of billions from people who don’t
want their product. Take a look at ESPN. They make $9 billion a year in
revenue. Two thirds of that is from subscriber fees. Most estimates say
that roughly 20% of households watch ESPN. Yet, 100% pay $8/mo to ESPN
as it is part of the basic cable package. As soon as those folks get the
chance to cut their bill by $70 a year, they will take it.  [This

goes into the details.

Of course, those billions coming out of cable bills into the channel
operators like ESPN, Yes, NESN and FoxSportsNet will force them to
change their business models. They will recoup some through other means
like higher fees, but most of it will come through downsizing. Part of
it means lower fees content suppliers, like sports leagues and
syndication companies. It also means smaller players will have great
access to customer and thus create alternative media. Live streaming
will be the next big thing.
