One of the transcendent features of left-wing people, regardless of time
and place, is their complete lack of self-awareness. The great blind
spot for all left-wing people is the reflection in the mirror. They are
incapable of seeing themselves other than as the hero in a great
struggle. This
[story](https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2022/03/19/how-vaccination-status-might-predict-views-on-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine.html)
out of Canada about the correlation between Covid-loving and
Putin-hating is a great example. The Left thinks it confirms their
righteous hatred of their enemy, but it merely confirms their lack of
self-awareness.

According to the story, “Unvaccinated Canadians are about 12 times more
likely than those who received three doses to believe Vladimir Putin’s
invasion of Ukraine was justified, according to a new survey by national
polling firm EKOS.” Now, polling is a dodgy business, so this could be a
fake poll designed to titillate the far-left. The fact that such a
scenario is possible, however, is more proof of the general thesis about
the far-left’s lack of self-awareness.

There are two ideas advanced in the coverage of this poll. One is that
the unvaccinated are immoral, so it stands to reason that they support
the evil Hitler guy.  The Left all over the West has been fixated on the
vaccine as a moral signifier. They rushed to be the first to prove their
piety within the Covid cult and they rushed to condemn the vaccine
skeptics as ignorant hooligans. The Left would have embraced face
tattoos for the vaccinated if it was an option.

That was something else that turned up in places with vaccine mandates.
There was some suggestion that the unvaccinated be forced to wear
armbands, but there were two problems with that plan. One is the obvious
link to some unfortunate events that occurred in the last century. The
other is the Left instinctively feared the armband would become a moral
signifier for their enemies. The unvaccinated would use it to show they
are the star-bellied sneetches of this age.

The other idea advanced in the story is the claim that the people who
did not want the vaccine are now pushing “Russian disinformation” about
the war. The whole disinformation meme has two aspects for the
hive-minded. One is the moral claim, but the other is ignorance. You
see, those who are not repeating the latest talking points from the hive
leaders are stupid and ignorant, which is why they succumb to the 
disinformation campaigns from the current devils.

Again, the poll and the media coverage have that just-so-story feel that
is popular with the far-left, so skepticism is the right position here.
The polling companies are extremely cynical, as befits people who make a
living serving sociopaths. They are perfectly willing and able to feed
nonsense to the true believers, because that is how they make a lot of
money. The customer is always right and their customers are the weird
identity cult that has gripped the managerial class. Here is an example.

“I saw it almost immediately, within days of the invasion, people
supporting it and some quite stridently,” said Timothy Caulfield, a
Canada Research Chair in health law and policy at the University of
Alberta who has studied the rise and spread of conspiracy theories. “It
was pro-Russia, pro-Putin, it was the same kind of dogmatic language you
heard from the anti-vaxxers about the alleged harms associated with
vaccines. And it was almost immediate and it was from the same crowd.”

This is a guy who rushed to get the Ukraine lapel pin and immediately
started saying “Keev” instead of “Kiev” while not being able to locate
Ukraine on a map. One day, normal people are seeing their favorite news
presenters discussing the latest pop stars and the next day those news
presenters are part of a chorus singing the praises of a place called
Ukraine. What we have seen from the managerial class over Ukraine is the
definition of dogmatic.

Of course, this is that lack of self-awareness we expect from the Left.
People engage in left-wing politics for the same reason they join UFO
cults. They hate themselves so they look to swap their hated sense of
self for the identity of a group. The primary driver is self-loathing.
In the case of the managerial class, the perceived status that is
awarded to the believer is an important bonus. The true believer loses
herself in the identity of the group and gets likes from higher status
people.

There is another factor to the appeal of this stuff. People attracted to
left-wing politics tend to have disorderly minds and the simplicity of
left-wing political framing provides needed structure. It is why it is
not unusual to see a highly-credentialed left-wing person who is useless
independently. They took to the structure of school, because they needed
it. They did not learn anything they could apply on their own, because
that was never the point of education for them.

Now as far as the unvaccinated, the unclean and the pro-Putin stuff,
this is a lot like other bogeymen that have haunted the Left. Few people
in the West are genuinely pro-Putin or pro-Russian with regards to the
war in Ukraine. There are those prudently skeptical of the chanting from
the usual suspects and those opposed to getting involved in the war.
Some on-line are mocking the dogmatism of the Left with over-the-top,
cartoonish Russia support.

This is reflected in the poll. Seventy percent of the unvaccinated were
honest enough to say they do not have an opinion on Ukraine. Only five
percent of the true believers offered no opinion. These are the same
people who thought ornamental face gear scared away Covid spirits. They
still think closing bars and restaurants magically prevents Covid. They
are the people who believe what they are told and faithfully point and
hiss at those who are not easily convinced.

Note that the poll compares the self-described unvaccinated with those
who are maximally vaccinated. The fact that they left out the
reluctantly vaccinated and the compulsory vaccinated is telling. Most
likely those results did not fit the narrative the poll is intended to
support. Most people took the vaccine out of necessity, their doctor
recommended it or they hoped it would put the charade to an end. The
genuinely enthusiastic for vaccines are a small subset of the
population.

The reaction by the Left to the war in Ukraine is another reminder that
it is impossible to constructively engage with true believers. Deeply
religious people can usually understand why you do not share their
faith. They are faithful, but they are not unaware of themselves. The
Left is a different breed of believer. They do no seek salvation from
the world. They seek salvation from themselves. This is why they obsess
over the latest enemies of their cause. That is their salvation.
