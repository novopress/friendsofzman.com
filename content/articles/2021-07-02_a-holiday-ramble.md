It is Fourth of July here in the empire and our rulers will be out
congratulating themselves on their wonderfulness. The late Washington
columnist Robert Novak used to say that he “loved his country but hated
his government.” That was my sentiment for a long time as well. The
orchestrated celebrations with politicians and other state actors always
made me wince, but I could still feel the stir when hearing myths about
the founding or stories about certain patriots from our history.

That last part has faded for the most part. If we take Ben Shapiro at
his word, patriotism just means a love of ideas. If that is true, then
there is no reason to have an emotional bond to the state or the history
that created the state. The celebrations and flag waving around holidays
like Independence Day are wildly out of line with his conception of
patriotism. Instead, your emotional bond should be to your people, not
the conditions in which they temporarily find themselves.

It is ironic how many on the Right now hold the same view of patriotism
that the Left used to hold a generation ago. Just a few decades ago it
was the Left that said patriotism was a con to keep people from noticing
what was happening. In the Bush years, they said
<a href="https://archive.is/fmg2L" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">dissent was the highest form of patriotism</a>. Today,
they put dissenters in prison on trumped up charges. They <a
href="https://www.revolver.news/2021/06/stewart-rhodes-oath-keepers-missing-link-fbi-unindicted-co-conspirator/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">orchestrate elaborate plots</a> to frame
people for schemes that were cooked up by state actors.

I talked about that Revolver story in the show. It reminds me of the old
gag about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. “People would stop
believing these conspiracy theories about Clinton if they stopped being
true.” It is increasingly looking like the so-called insurrection was
another hoax. Protestors did clash with cops, and they did barge into
the capitol, but it was at the direction of state actors. That does not
absolve them of what they did, if any of it was criminal, but it stinks,
nonetheless.

It is not just the issue of patriotism. Look at how attitudes have
shifted on the issue of corporate power. A generation ago the Left was
the alleged enemy of big business, while the Right offered a limited
defense. Bill Buckley famously said that “the problem with socialism is
socialism, but the problem with capitalism is capitalists.” The roles
are reversed now. The Left, which has now absorbed the Buckley Right
entirely, loves big business and they use it as a <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2021/07/01/manchin-when-corporate-america-pushes-back-the-legislatures-will-do-the-right-thing-on-voting-laws/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">weapon</a> against the Right.

We have traveled far since the heyday of Conservative Inc. There you
have a sitting senator asking corporate America to crush the democratic
process. No one thinks it is odd that a Democrat is the one doing it.
The entirety of corporate America is now far Left by the reckoning of
the day. The same is true of sports leagues, which are happy to punish
locals for getting too uppity with their masters. This Independence Day,
I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/95ND_fwX2fM" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Jeremiah Johnson</a> in the final scene of the movie.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
