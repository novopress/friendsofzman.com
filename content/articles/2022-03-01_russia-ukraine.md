One of the interesting sidelights to the crisis in Ukraine is the
hyper-reaction of the American media. It has been a blend of foaming at
the mouth jingoism, unhinged hysteria and absolute nonsense. Since the
rest of the English-speaking world follows the lead of the American
media, the world has been flooded with what probably sounds like a tidal
wave of craziness. The start of actual fighting in Ukraine has made the
situation worse in the information space.

As is so often the case, the one place you must avoid if you want to
know what is happening in Europe right now is the American media. They
have fallen for at least one Sam Hyde gag. They have been caught using
old pictures from different events and screenshots from movies. They
seem to be willing to believe the most outlandish nonsense about both
sides. Of course, the Ukrainians are the Spartans at Thermopylae and the
Russians are bloodthirsty Nazis.

What we know so far is that there has been some contact between
Ukrainian forces and Russian forces. We also know the Russians are now
staged in-country, outside various cities and strategically important
spots. We also know that the Ukrainians have been willing to talk, after
initially refusing peace talks. The first round happened a couple of
days ago and another round is scheduled this week. We also have not seen
much in the way of reliable footage indicating heavy combat.

Taken as a whole, with the understanding that lots of pieces of the
puzzle are missing, the most likely situation right now is not much is
happening. The Russians swept in but stopped short of going into major
cites. They have most certainly occupied the disputed provinces in the
east and have liquidated the Ukrainian irregulars. Otherwise, the lack
of images is the result of two armies in a stand-off as the political
and psychological war rages around them.

For their part, the Ukrainians have no reason to engage the Russian army
directly, as they would eventually lose. It may take a few weeks, but
the outcome is certain and the price to the civilian population would be
high. They have the backing of the West to a point and the longer their
army is in the field and functioning, they have a chance to cut a deal
with the Russians. For Zelensky, his army and his cities are chips he
will play over the next weeks to make a deal for himself.

Interestingly, the Russians may have a similar calculus. As long as
their army is camped outside Kiev, they have options they did not have
last week. For example, they can settle the question of the eastern
provinces now. The facts on the ground matter and those two provinces no
longer belong to Ukraine. They can also force NATO to discuss their
security concerns in a serious way. The longer their army is in the
field the more willing the West is to cut a deal with them.

That is where the Ukrainian and Russian similarities end. Zelensky
agreed to talks because he knows the other option is he becomes a CNN
anchor. If the press reports were true and the heroic Ukrainian army was
fighting the Reds to a standstill, his position would be simple. Russia
leaves or else. He is at the table to buy time and avoid being run out
of his own country. He is looking for a face-saving deal that leaves him
in power and in good standing with the West.

The Russians want what they have plus two more things. They have the
provinces and they are not going back to Ukrainians control. What they
want from the peace talks is agreement from Zelensky on this fact. That
becomes an endorsement of the deal and thus strips the West of claims to
the contrary. They also want an end to discussions about Ukraine joining
NATO or the EU. If this comes from the Western puppet government, it
basically comes from Washington.

A wildcard in all of this is time. It is assumed the Russians wanted to
quickly knock out the Ukrainians, but that appears to be false. They
want a deal with *this* Ukrainian government, not one they install. That
means they came into this with a much longer timeline than has been
suggested. How long they are willing or able to keep their army in the
field is unknown, but it is probably months, maybe longer. All we know
is we do not know their timeline for ending this.

For now, the Ukrainians have all the time in the world. The West is
waving around their flag on social media and promising support. They
know this is mostly public relations and that eventually, the West will
move into other issues. For now, they have no reason to cut a deal with
the Russians. They have every reason to stall for time and hope some
miracle happens that causes the Russians to change their position. Like
the Russians, they have months, maybe longer to wait.

Another wildcard in all of this is economics. Ukraine and Russia ship a
lot of food and energy to the MENA countries. The reason that region was
convulsed by revolts ten years ago was food and fuel prices spiked. In a
world already suffering double-digit retail inflation and supply chain
problems, another factor driving up prices for essentials could create
massive headaches for everyone. It is not as if the Western countries
are in peace and harmony right now either.

That brings in the other wildcard. Another wave of migrants from the
south could easily swamp Europe this spring. What keeps the waves of
migrants from flooding Europe are countries like Syria and Turkey. The
former is a Russian client state and the later has a lot of axes to
grind with the Europeans. Turkey has been in economic crisis for months,
so opening up the migrant valve could be a useful way to lower the
temperature domestically, especially if there are food shortages.

What all of this means is this conflict could stagger on for a long time
before the parties decided they have to settle things. It also means the
geniuses in Washington who instigated this did not anticipate any of
what is happening. That will surely cause problems in trying to reach a
deal. They have backed themselves into a corner and cannot sign off on
any deal right now. That will drag out whatever negotiations are
happening between Ukraine and Russia.
