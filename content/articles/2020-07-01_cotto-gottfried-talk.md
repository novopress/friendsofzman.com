In an effort to enjoy a little time off this week, the regularly
scheduled post will be replaced with a prerecorded item. A re-run, of
sorts. My conversation with Joe Cotto and professor Paul Gottfried is up
on YouTube. It was probably my favorite one of these I have done. Paul
is a brilliant guy, of course, but the topics were just about ideal for
the both of us, so it made for a good show. Some technical glitches
slowed things down a bit, but even with those, I think it came out
pretty well. Enjoy.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
