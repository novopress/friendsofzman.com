Throughout the Cold War years, it was a standard claim from the people
called the left in America that the intelligence services manipulated
domestic politics. This did not come from the mainstream left, but the
fringier left-wing activists. For its part, the right in all its forms
simply ignored the claims. Eventually, the mainstream right became the
primary defenders of the intelligence agencies. They were viewed as the
first line of defense in the Cold War and thus were lionized.

Of course, the claims about the intel agencies were not without some
merit. In the late 1960’s a communist student publication called
*Ramparts* reported that the National Student Association, which was a
federation of student governments, was funded and controlled by the CIA.
Later it was revealed by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Church Committee</a> that many newspapers were
cooperating with the CIA. Operation Mockingbird was one of the CIA
programs used to manipulate the media.

The Church Committee is an interesting bit of history as it might be the
last time Congress did anything useful in terms of oversight. The final
report was massive and you can still <a
href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/resources/intelligence-related-commissions"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">access</a> it on the Senate website. One
reform that resulted from this event was the establishment of the
permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which has been
thoroughly captured by the CIA. Members of this committee participated
in the Russian collusion hoax, for example.

Putting that aside, the headline item at the time was that the
intelligence agencies were spying on Americans, experimenting on
Americans, and manipulating the media by placing assets at media
companies. In the fullness of time, the important revelation was that
this practice was thoroughly normalized in the agencies. The intel
agencies saw nothing wrong with what they were doing. That means we can
assume they continued doing it despite the revelations.

Again, the Russian collusion hoax is a good starting point. If the intel
agencies were comfortable in trying to overturn the 2016 presidential
election, then it is safe to assume this behavior is normalized inside
these agencies. That returns us to the Church Committee and the scale of
operations fifty years ago. In the analog days, the intel agencies were
comfortable with subverting newspapers, so what sorts of things will
they be comfortable doing in the digital age?

For example, would the intel agencies pay social media influencers? If
they were paying student groups in the 1960’s how opposed would they be
to paying social media characters to push certain themes? It is not as
if anyone bothers to look into the background of bigfoot influencers.
These characters seem to appear from nowhere, gain a big audience and
join the ranks of influencers. Inserting intel agents into this space is
a low-cost, high reward activity.

Look at someone like Michael Tracey, who is a bigfoot influencer on
Twitter with over a quarter million followers. According to Twitter,
about 15% of their users have more than one thousand followers. Only one
percent of American users have more than three thousand followers. That
means someone with a quarter million followers is in a ridiculously
small club of users. This assumes the follower counts are accurate and
the followers are not purchased from a bot farm.

Michael Tracey has no job and no obvious source of income. He lives in
New York City, one of the most expensive places in America. He regularly
travels the world to pester government officials at press gatherings.
His Substack mostly gathers dust, in terms of readership, and he never
posts monetized content on Twitter. Maybe he has a rabbi that
underwrites his activity, which is not unusual, but maybe that rabbi is
tied to one of the intel agencies, which would not be unusual either.

Note that Tracey spends most of time doing FUD-packing. FUD stands for
Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Right now, he is flaming the Trump world
right now with claims that Trump is responsible for the war funding
bills. It is a weird claim, but coming from a major account it does seep
into the public consciousness. This is new for him, as he usually spends
his time attacking progressives. In fact, he built his following on the
right by FUD-packing the people on the left.

Now, Michael Tracey is probably on the level, but there is no way of
knowing it, which is the point of this example. In a world where people
are more likely to get their information from anonymous and unexamined
characters on social media, how hard would it be for the intel agencies
to manipulate this system? Build up a network of influential FUD-packers
and you can control the unhappy portion of both political parties by
saturating them with misery.

Here is something else to consider. These days, the intel agencies do
not have to actually buy the FUD-packer. They can simply manipulate him
though the various donations options most people have these days. When
they like the FUD-packing from an influencer, they can send a bunch of
small donations. They can also use their bot farms to boost that guy’s
FUD-packing. In other words, a FUD-packer could be compromised without
even knowing it.

The point of thinking about FUD-packing is that we live in an age where
it is much easier for the intel agencies to do what they habitually were
doing fifty years ago, so it is wise to assume it is as common now as it
was back then. The digital information space is now a wilderness of
mirrors manipulated by people who are drawn to the work because they
love FUD-packing. As a result, our information space is a FUD-packers
ball where nothing should be taken at face value.
