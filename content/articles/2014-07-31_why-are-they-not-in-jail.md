rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to this story</a>,
the CIA has been illegally wiretapping the Senate.

*The Central Intelligence Agency improperly and covertly hacked into
computers used by Senate staffers to investigate the spy agency’s
Bush-era interrogation practices, according to an internal
investigation.*

*CIA Director John Brennan has determined that employees “acted in a
manner inconsistent with the common understanding” brokered between the
CIA and its Senate overseers, according to agency spokesman Dean Boyd.*

*The stunning admission follows a <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scathing, 40-minute speech</a>
Senate Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein gave from the Senate
floor back in March, in which she accused the CIA of covertly removing
key documents from her panel’s computers during its review of the
government’s torture, detention and rendition policies during the Bush
presidency. The powerful California Democrat lacerated the CIA and
charged them with possibly violating the Constitution.*

Why was this announcement not accompanied by reports of CIA employees
being led out in chains to be processed for trial? One of the greatest
dangers to a self-governing republic is a rogue spy agency using
confidential material against the people’s representatives. That’s why
every sane country has laws prohibiting it. We also used to hang people
for this sort of stuff. The unwillingness of the Congress to tackle this
problem will come back to haunt them in the future.
