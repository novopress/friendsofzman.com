Without much fanfare and no coverage in Western media, one of the most
important agreements of the 20th century was allowed to expire last
week. That agreement is the deal made between the United States and
Saudi Arabia in 1974 that established what has been known ever since as
the petro-dollar. Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively
in U.S. dollars and invest its surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury
bonds while the U.S. provided military protection to the kingdom.

The importance of this deal cannot be overstated. The demand for dollars
has kept the currency strong and thus kept imports cheap. It also
allowed the Federal Reserve to “export excess dollars” to developing
countries with a need for dollars. The institutional demand for
treasuries as a result of this agreement allowed for the low interest
rate environment we have seen for decades. This has made it possible for
the United States to build up massive debts both publicly and privately.

Another way to think about this deal is by pricing energy in dollars,
the dollar became the default global currency because the dollar was a
proxy for energy units. This made the Saudis the head of the mint and
the Federal Reserve the global bank. The Saudis could control the flow
of energy units around the world, a very profitable position, and the
United States could skim from every transaction denominated in dollars,
which was every transaction across national borders.

The reason for the lack of coverage of this historic event is two-fold.
One is the mass media is now populated by zombies with no agency of
their own, so until the regime hands them copy, they have nothing to
say. The other is the financial world has no idea where this is going.
Five years ago, no one imagined this deal would be allowed to expire,
but years of mismanagement by the Biden administration has made a hash
of things all over the world.

There is speculation that the Saudis are simply bargaining hard knowing
that the Biden admin is desperate. Anthony Blinken is supposedly
prepared to offer the Saudis a generous nuclear package, in addition to
more military support, in order to continue the relationship, but of
course it comes with a catch. The Saudis will have to normalize
relations with Israel, something they are loath to do. There is no
upside to them making a deal with a regime that routinely slaughters
Arabs.

Now, the expiry of this deal does not mean much at the present. Half a
century of pricing everything important in dollars will not be unraveled
quickly. Tens of trillions in assets are priced in dollars, so the
dollar remains the default currency, but it does open the door to
alternatives. The Saudis will now accept other currencies for their
energy products, which means OPEC will follow their lead. China can now
buy oil in yuan, rather than swap yuan for dollars.

In the short-term this will not change much of anything, but over time
it will result in a decrease in the demand for dollars. For example, if
you trade with China for manufactured goods, it makes sense to trade in
the yuan for energy products as it simplifies trade with China. The same
is true for the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, and the Brazilian real.
Of course, it also means bypassing the American controlled banking
system for settling these transactions.

The next shoe to drop in this process is a settlement system that
operates outside the control of Washington. Project mBridge is a scheme
for creating a digital currency to facilitate cross border transactions.
The Saudis have recently joined this project, which is mainly supported
by China. The Russians have recently shown interest in the project,
despite years of resistance. The trade war launched by Washington has
changed opinion in Moscow about dealing with the West.

That is another aspect to this. The Russian economy not only absorbed
the sanctions blow, but it has also grown faster than the Western
economies. Russia now has the fourth largest economy in the world.
Sanctions forced the Russians to do thigs like replace the retail credit
card system with their own system. They cleaned up their banking system
to root out fraud and corruption. It was an inadvertent test case for
creating financial systems outside of Western control.

Again, none of this signal the collapse of the dollar. The people
screaming such things have no idea how the world actually works. What we
are seeing is the slow decline of the American financial order. The
countries that make things, fix things, dig things from the ground and
invent things are starting to see that they do not need the countries
that merely count things. This is especially true when the people doing
the counting have a history of stealing from their customers.

What comes next is the slow decline in the demand for dollars and euros,
which will make inflation a feature of Western economies. It will also
mean the slow rise in borrowing rates in the West. If the rest of the
world needs fewer dollars and euros it means they need fewer bonds
denominated in dollars and euros. That leaves Western governments with
the choice of cutting spending or printing money, which is the same
thing but only less honest.

None of this was inevitable. After the Cold War, the United States could
have remained the world’s banker and honest broker. Instead, the
economic elites of America allowed the world’s most dishonest people to
gain control of foreign policy. They used that power to launch a decades
long crusade against their ancient enemies and in the process, they
squandered the good name of the American people and destroyed global
trust in the United States. Decline is now what must follow.
