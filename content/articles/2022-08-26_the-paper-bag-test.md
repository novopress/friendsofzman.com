**Note:** Since Friday is usually podcast day and there is no podcast
this week, I thought it would be good to spring something from the
behind the green door. For those with a paywall account, this is a
repeat. For the vast majority here, this is entirely new since you have
failed to sign up for a paywall account. Perhaps seeing the error of
your ways, you will reconsider your decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here in Greater Lagos, there are several grocery chains. The small
moonbat community is serviced by Whole Foods, of course. They empty
their wallets buying exploitation-free artisanal pickles. A step below
that is Wegmans, which targets the same sort of shopper, but a click
down the socioeconomic ladder. The Wegman’s customer lives in a nice
suburb and supports *most* of the current fads.

The next step down is Giant, which is owned by the colossal Dutch
conglomerate Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. They also operate other
regional brands such as Stop &amp; Shop and Food Lion. Interestingly,
the Food Lions in Lagos are positioned near ghettos, so their customer
base is the polar opposite of Whole Foods. In the South, Food Lion is
the standard suburban grocery store.

After that comes the specialty shops and local players. Aldi has started
to turn up, offering a warehouse experience for food shopping. In
Europe, an Aldi is like a big convenience store. They are not as big as
an American grocery store, but they serve the same function. The ones I
have experienced in America are a cross between Dollar Tree and
Walmart’s food area.

The point is we have a lot of options. I tend to go to the Wegman’s near
my office because of quality and selection. It is a little more
expensive than the Giant, which is across the street, but the trade-off
is worth it to me. The staff is also nicer than the people who work at
Giant. For some reason, the people who work at the Giant stores near me
are surly and unpleasant.

Starting on August 1st, Wegman’s has stopped using plastic bags. I found
this out the hard way when I hit the checkout. I use the self-checkout.
All of the plastic bag holders were empty. I asked the clerk, thinking
it may be some weird shortage issue and instead I got a lecture about
the environment from a moron. Interestingly, she said it was a new law
in the county, which I know is a lie.

That says the lecture was part of her training. She was forced to
memorize the official answer by store management, which she repeated
when people bitched about the new plastic bag policy. Put another way,
this means the company knew their customers would hate it and they knew
the policy was not defensible on its own terms, so they had to produce a
justification.

The main reason grocery stores switched to plastic bags was that they
are superior to the old paper bags. Plastic bags let you carry more
stuff. They rarely rip. They also make useful gloves for picking up
after the dog. Paper bags rip and they really show their stuff when it
rains. Carrying your stuff to the car on a rainy day is an exercise in
frustration with paper bags.

Of course, the cranks behind these schemes will counter that you can
always use the grimy canvas sacks that have become one of their totems.
They apparently believe that if there is a climate rapture while they
are shopping, Gaia will be able to home in on their grimy canvas sacks.
Gaia also commands them to impose their weird morality on the rest of
us, so you better fall in line bigot.

What makes the Wegman’s scheme more ridiculous is the fact that they are
now charging for the paper bags. Each one is a nickel. There is a
ceremonial reconciliation at the end of the checkout. This is another
one those clues that the scheme is driven by something other than
business interests. The people behind it want you to know that they are
compelling you to obey Gaia.

It was clear that the law of unintended consequences is kicking in.
Because packing paper sacks is a hassle, fewer people were in the
self-checkout. The lines for regular checkout were longer. This means
the store will be faced with staffing up or losing business due to
people not wanting to wait all day to checkout. It also means more
customer hassles to be addressed by the staff.

The most obvious result will be many people going across the street to
the Giant, which is there to sell food, not preach the gospel of Gaia.
No doubt the people at Wegman’s will see this as a triumph. They have
finally purged those hidden fascists prowling the cereal aisle of their
stores. It is the price they are willing to pay for the war on white
supremacy and climate change or whatever.

The whole thing is another example of how this stuff works like a
religion. The people who produced this crackpot idea are not doing it to
make money. They are not doing it to curry favor with a specific
audience. It is a public act of piety. This is all about proving their
faith because they really do believe this stuff. Rational arguments to
the contrary are just seen as proof of their eternal goodness.

It is one thing, but multiply this by hundreds of examples and it is not
hard to see why everyone is so salty. We live in a world where a small
cadre of lunatics are trying to impose their beliefs on the rest of us.
Not only are those beliefs insane, but they keep changing almost as if
the point of the religion is to be a nuisance. The Church of the Public
Nuisance now controls public life.
