While most see the collapse of Syria as just another Middle East country
thrown into chaos by the American government, it is a good lesson in the
dangers that come when a distinct minority rules over the majority. The
ISIS rebels get the credit, but the real blame lies with the way in
which the Syria state was structured. Until now, Syria was ruled by one
of the many minorities in the region. That minority is a mysterious
ethnoreligious group called the Alawites.

The place to start is with the people. Syria has some of the oldest
communities in the world, dating back to the ancient world. Maaloula, a
village in western Syria, is one of the last remaining places where
Aramaic is spoken. There are Christian communities that date back to
Rome. Of course, Islam has been in the area now called Syria since the
time of Mohamed. There is also the ethnoreligious group called the
Alawites, which split from Shia Islam at some unknown point in the past.

The origins and identity of the Alawites are a mystery. There are
roughly four million of them in the region. Their legends say they are
descendants of the followers of the eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari. The
reason he is called the eleventh Iman is because he was one of the
twelve imams who claimed to be the spiritual and biological successors
of the Mohamed. These are the founders of Shia Islam. Exactly how they
became this distinct subgroup within Islam remains a mystery.

Now, Shia Islam is itself a minority within Islam. Roughly ten percent
of all Muslim belong to a sect within the Shia designation. The vast
majority of Muslims, especially in the Arab world, are Sunnis.
Unsurprisingly, the relations between the Sunnis and Shia have never
been good. One result of this enmity between the two camps is that the
Sunnis, who make up seventy percent of Syria, claim the Alawites are not
just heretics and non-believers, but not even Arabs.

That last claim is not without some merit. There has been a great deal
of effort to gloss over the ethnic realities in that part of the world.
Western experts are sure that there is no such thing as biological
reality, so differences in people, even genetic differences, are
explained as cultural differences. The locals, however, understand that
the Levant has been the land of invaders, and they left behind more than
just their buildings and some of their cultural practices.

That aside, the Alawites have been a highly clannish and resourceful
group, often creating problems for the local rulers. The Ottomans tried
to suppress them on multiple occasions, but also found them useful in
roles requiring skill, like tax farming and managing the empire’s
finances. When the Europeans came to dominate the region in the 19th
century, the Alawites proved useful to their new rulers. It turns out
that every ruler needs smart and clever people.

It is this ability to run complex systems that eventually allowed the
Alawites to take control of Syria. That and their clannishness. Under
the French, the Alawites played a key role, which gave them access to
power and resources. After independence, their resourcefulness and
understanding of the systems left by the Europeans allowed Hafez
al-Assad and his Ba’ath Party to seize power. The Alawites, despite
their numbers, were smarter than their rivals.

As an aside, one of the many claims about the Alawites by the Muslim
majority is that they supported Israeli independence and had a long
working relationship with the Jews in the region. This is generally
considered a smear, but it is clear that the Alawites were willing to
work with other minority groups in the region. The Assad family famously
protected the Christian communities in Syria, for example. Minorities
have a funny habit of sticking together against the majority.

That aside, a country run by a distinct and distrusted minority is never
going to be stable, especially when the minority is tiny. This is why
the Assad government had been ruthless at times when dealing with the
Sunni majority. To keep the peace, the government had to make clear to
anyone thinking otherwise that the government would use maximum force to
maintain the peace. Minority rule is always made worse by the tactics
necessary to maintain it.

Of course, the Assad led Syria had been useful to the West for a long
time, so they got the support they needed to maintain themselves. Until
now, it had been assumed that chaos in Syria would be bad for the region
and bad for Israel. As a rule, confident countries seek stability in
their diplomacy. Now that the official policy of the United States is to
spread chaos around the world, Assad was an easy target for the now
familiar regime change operation.

Regime change was possible in Syria because it was a minority government
ruling a hostile majority. Western sanctions starved Syria of the cash
it needed to bribe enough of the majority into supporting them. Turkish
and American terror groups operating within Syria put constant pressure
on the government. The reason Assad fell so quickly to this hodgepodge
of ISIS radicals is the Alawite system collapsed. The ISIS mob was
simply the straw that broke the camel’s back.

This is what makes Syria a timeless lesson. No society run by a distinct
minority can be stable, as the majority will always distrust that
minority. Even when minority rule results in good times, as in the case
of colonial Africa, the majority will find reasons to resent that
minority. In fact, the good times allows that resentment to slowly build
under the surface of apparent tranquility. As soon as bad times come,
the majority revolts and the laws of large numbers takes its course.

Syria is why the Israelis have no interest in ruling over Arabs. They
could take control of Gaza and the West Bank, for example, but they
would be viewed as a minority ruling a hostile majority, so expulsion is
their preferred option. In the oldest part of the world, the people
still understand the oldest lessons. One of those is that a minority
ruling a majority must always be a temporary condition. In the end,
numbers always matter more than even human capital. The majority wins in
the end.
