A recurring plot line in modern life is the famous person being exposed
for some sort of fraud about themselves or their work. For example, the
notorious race hustler Robin DiAngelo was found to have <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/books/robin-diangelo-white-fragility-accusation-plagiarism.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">ripped off</a> black writers for her PhD
thesis. It seems that the only reason we hear about people in academia
is when they have been exposed for having broken the rules of the
academy. Christopher Rufo has turned this into a cottage industry in
service to his campaign for a color-blind America.

We are seeing this in the election campaign. Tim Walz is a serial
exaggerator. It seems that all of the important parts of his life story
have been enhanced in ways to make him seem like a hero in various
narratives. He exaggerated his military service, so he pretends to be a
war hero and preach against guns. He likes to call himself “an old
football coach” but he never really coached football. He likes to pose
as Elmer Fudd, but people who know about such things see that it is just
a pose.

Walz is not the first guy to enhance his resume. In fact, it is now the
way things are done by the beautiful people. The current governor of
Maryland, a guy some think could be president one day, has a stolen
valor <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/books/robin-diangelo-white-fragility-accusation-plagiarism.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">problem</a>. Note that like Walz, his
story about himself is not an outright lie, but more like an
exaggeration, in the way a good storyteller fictionalizes events in
order to make the tale interesting. For most of our public figures,
their life story is “inspired by real events.”

The main reason they do this is they usually get away with it. No one in
the media will ask Tim Walz tough questions about his biography. When
J.D. Vance pointed out the exaggerations, the media attacked him for
questioning the patriotism of Tim Walz, which is such an outlandish
thing to say it should be followed with lightning bolts striking the
people saying it. Even so, fudging the resume has become the thing
people do if they want to make it to the big stage of life.

Part of this is due to the shift from authenticity to <a
href="https://www.thecourieronline.co.uk/our-age-of-profilicity-interview-with-hans-georg-moeller-full-version/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">prolificity</a>. In the prior age,
morality required a person to live an authentic life and present their
life honestly. You were a bad person if you faked your resume or faked
your public persona. Increasingly, the path to success is in creating a
public image that is pleasing to the crowd and disconnected from
physical reality. The reimagination of Kamala Harris is an effort to
formalize this in the first fully online election campaign.

Another possible cause is the fact that public life has come to be
dominated by actors hired by the economic elites to play various roles
in public life. The days of a man getting rich and then going to
Washington to represent his community or rising up in state politics are
long gone. Rich people hire people to play the role of politicians, and
they hire people to pressure and influence them in what has become the
theater of democracy, a spectacle staged for our entertainment.

For Tim Walz, the most important thing about his otherwise mundane life
was getting into the circus of politics. To do that he figured out how
to take the facts of his life, reimagine them so they fit the character
of a woke prairie populist. This act has taken him from community
theater to the biggest stage in the circus. The reason he exaggerated
the resume was that the act required it. If the act needed him to become
a transvestite, he would do it. There is no dignity in show biz.

This is also why our politics are supercilious and narcissistic. Actors
have always been known as supercilious and narcissistic because even the
lowest member of the show has had to overcome a lot to get on stage.
Often, they have had to degrade themselves in order to get a break. This
is possible because they are sure they are the person they imagine on
the stage, wowing the crowd. The actor always has an exaggerated sense
of self and when it works, they are filled with confidence.

It is why we have Kamala Harris a click away from becoming the first
halfwit hapa to become president. There is nothing authentic about
Harris, not even her DNA, so she could be viewed as the logical end
point of a process that has sought to strip all reality from politics
and replace it with emotive narratives. Her campaign is running on “good
vibes” because a world detached from reality has only emotion. Kamala
Harris is the ideal candidate for a world that can only exist in our
imagination.

It is also why we get people like Amanda Gorman, the official poet of
the United States, whose poetry is nothing more than
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ055ilIiN4" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">emotive nonsense</a>. As John Derbyshire <a
href="https://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/RadioDerb/2021-10-01.html#06b"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">observed</a>, it fails to qualify as
poetry. It is why an incoherent simpleton like Kanye West can pretend to
be a genius musician, despite lacking a shred of musical ability. Our
public life is overrun with carnies who think they are the role they
play. The result is a public life not detached from reality, but at war
with the concept of reality.

It is tempting to assume this cannot last, but reason says it should
never have reached this point, so maybe it can last. The idea that
reality may possibly be a figment of our imagination has been with
mankind for as long as we know. Perhaps the long arc of humanity ends
with proving this correct. The escape from the human condition is the
embrace of the collective theater of the mind where all things are
possible. Alternatively, maybe the machine just <a
href="https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS188/PDF_files/Machine_stops.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stops</a> and then the theater goes dark.
