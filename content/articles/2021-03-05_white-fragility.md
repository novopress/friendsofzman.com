One of the strange things about living through a particular time is that
things that define that age in the moment just seem to pop up from
nothing. For example, one day two men getting married is a punchline to
a joke. The next day you are in human resources signing your termination
papers for mocking homosexual marriage. One day men in drag are
something you recall your parents laughing at and the next day your
kid’s teacher is in a frock demanding you call him “they” for some
reason.

The reason these things feel like they have sprung from nowhere is most
people are normal, living normal lives. They are too busy living those
normal lives to look into who is plotting what over in the shadows of
the managerial class. Most of us live outside the world of elite
opinion, so we cannot see it evolving and embracing the latest boutique
opinions to wear around like amulets. By the time we notice, the
finished product has been imposed onto the culture.

That is what’s useful about looking into the people profiting from the
new moral panic of whiteness and its related items, like white
supremacy. Russ Travers is Mumbly Joe’s new antiwhite crusader. Before
he was an antiwhite crusader, he was an anti-Muslim crusader in the now
largely defunct War on Terror™. He got canned last spring as the Trump
administration tried to purge these people from the system. He claims it
was due to his demand to go after whites, instead of Muslims.

Of course, what was really going on is this guy was getting off the
anti-Muslim bus and jumping on the anti-white bus. He saw that the
former was a dying racket, but the former offered an ambitious career
man like him many new opportunities. Rather than try his luck in the
dreaded private sector, which is worse than death, he quickly became an
evangelist against white supremacist terror. Again, yesterday the great
threat was Islam and today the great threat is you. Just like that.

In reality, this antiwhite pogrom was in the works for years. You see
that in the resume of Robin DiAngelo, the authoress of the book *White
Fragility*. She started out trying to grift on the feminism stuff, but
that was an overserved market, so she tried getting into the diversity
rackets, but then she stumbled into the gold mine. She could be a life
coach to guilty white liberals, in major corporations and government,
helping them confront their white privilege and implicit racism.

Does Mx DiAngelo believe the nonsense she promotes? Probably not. Conmen
believe in one thing. “You can’t cheat an honest man; never give a
sucker an even break or smarten up a chump.” What she believes does not
matter. It is what the chumps she is fleecing believe that matters. The
managerial class, which has the money and power, believes white people
are the problem, so grifters like Robin DiAngelo are there to tell them
they are right. Russ Travers will protect them.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
