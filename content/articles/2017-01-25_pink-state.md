O’Sullivan’s First Law states that any organization or enterprise that
is not expressly right wing will become left wing over time. The law is
named after British journalist and former National Review editor John
O’Sullivan. This is especially ironic as O’Sullivan was forced to
abandon most of his right wing positions in order to avoid being purged
from National Review. Diseases are often named after a famous victim,
but this is the first time the victim named his disease before he
contracted it.

Red State is a website that was originally started as sort of a
“conservative” alternative to the left-wing blogosphere. I put quotes
there because Red State’s brand of conservatism has always been the
housebroken type of stuff popular on the Bush wing of the GOP. Like a
lot of so-called conservatives in the Bush years, Red State was
basically just a cheering section for the Republicans. Whatever Team
Bush proposed, Red State branded as “Reaganesque” and “principled
conservatism”, especially if it meant killing Muslims.

That probably sounds harsh, but I’m just getting started. Serial
plagiarist Ben Domenech, pen for hire Joshua Trevino and the portly
proselytizer Erick Erickson saw an opportunity to promote themselves,
and maybe lever their popularity with conservative voters, into the
careers they thought they deserved. The whole point of Red State was to
ball-gargle the establishment, hoping to turn their obsequious
rumpswabbery into a Jonah Goldberg lifestyle. The three of them are
emblematic of what went wrong with conservatism.

Anyway, this all came to mind because of <a

target="_blank">this post on Red State</a> that looks like it should be
on the

target="_blank">The fat dope</a> who posted that nonsense is a good
example of the sort of people who infiltrate the organizations that are
not “expressly right wing” and turn them into left wing organizations.
His primary motivation is signalling his fidelity to the One True Faith
by pointing at the nearest heretic and yelling “witch.”  Fatty was
probably dressed as a vagina down at the Women’s Waddle in Washington.
That’s because “principled conservatism” means locking arms with
liberals to oppose Trump.

Anyway, you see all the cons used by social justice warriors in that
post. There’s guilt by association, the use of the transitive property
to link the targeted enemy to some imagined evil and, of course, the
demand that the target abandon their position or face being branded a
heretic. In this case, it means the very sensible and respectable Mark
Krikorian must denounce people he does not know or he and his issues are
ruled out of bounds for decent people. Fatty does not have an argument
to make. He just wants to curry favor with his fellow lunatics by
accusing someone of heresy.

Like all of the sites in the cuck-o-sphere, Red State has seen its
traffic collapse over the last year. That’s because they were never
expressly conservative. They were always just to the right of the
Official Left. As progressives rocketed off into identity politics, all
of these guys tagged along behind them, convinced that being a little
less enthusiastic for the latest liberal fads was enough to make them
“conservative” and keep the good times rolling. As a result, they
claim anyone not falling for their act is a Nazi.

Red State becoming Pink State is no surprise as it was never expressly
right wing, rather it was just a marketing vehicle for the people who
started it. All of them have moved on as the enterprise served its
purpose. Now it is being overrun by rotund rodents like Neil Stevens,
launching purity campaigns against everyone to their right. It’s a good
lesson for those inclined to support the emerging voices out of the
Dissident Right. Not all of them are in it for the right reasons so
taking any of them at face value is not a good idea.
