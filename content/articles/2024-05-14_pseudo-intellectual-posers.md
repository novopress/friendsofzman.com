An aspect of modern politics that does not get discussed is that it is
less about the practical things politics is supposed to address and
mostly about esoteric and abstract ideas that have meaning only because
we pretend so. Look at the current crop of campaign ads and the
candidates may as well be running against the bogeyman or in favor of
the good juju. Without the party labels, it would be impossible to know
anything about the candidates.

This was not always the case. The old joke about politics was that every
candidate ran around promising two cars in every garage and a chicken in
every pot. The point was they all had plans about how to increase
material prosperity. Even though no politician speaks to anything
specific these days, the economy remains the top issue with voters
because the prevailing assumption inherited from the past is that
politics is supposed to be about practical things like fixing potholes.

One reason for the shift in political rhetoric is that the public square
has become the domain of clever midwits playing word games with one
another. Public discourse is now controlled by credentialed experts who
have no idea how anything works, other than the complex game of
relationships that defines the managerial class. That means they are
good at constructing complicated intellectual structures that are useful
in rhetorical jousting but have no connection to reality.

One result of this is that mainstream politics rests on the false
choice. The “sides” in any debate struggle with one another to see who
can impose their false dichotomy on the debate in order to gain the
moral high ground. One way this is done is to conjure a nightmare
scenario from the other side’s proposal and then claim the choice is
between that nightmare and present reality. Alternatively, they will
conjure a glorious fantasy out of their ideas and compare that to
present reality.

A good example of how this works is this
<a href="https://lawliberty.org/unanchored-in-el-salvador/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> at the libertarian site Lawn &
Liberty that wags the bony finger at people on the right who have
praised the crime policies of Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele. Crime
has plummeted in El Salvador since they began rounding up the gangs and
putting them in isolation. The government has effectively cut the gangs
out of society and placed them in a facility from which there is no
communication to the outside world.

What the writer of that post is doing is pretending that it is possible
to build a civil libertarian paradise in El Salvador. That is the ideal
against which he is measuring the highly effective policies of Bukele.
This is the false dichotomy. On the one hand we have the rough, but
effective justice used by the government to address the crime problem
and on the other hand we have this magical reality where there is no
crime and no rough justice to deal with crime.

This line gets at the problem. “It’s easy to see why so many on the
right have become enamored with Bukele. They too lack basic respect for
rules and institutions. They, like him, are largely unanchored by any
coherent set of ideas or philosophy.” It is the old joke about
libertarians saying, “Sure, the policy works in the real world but does
to work in theory?” The writer cares more about his precious
abstractions than about the thousands of lives saved by these policies.

What is not so obvious is that his definition of “coherent set of ideas
or philosophy” is normative one. Bukele has a coherent set of ideas. It
starts with doing what works to solve the crime problem. He identified
the problem, evaluated various ways to address the problem and settled
on that which creates the best result. That is about as coherent as one
can get from public policy, but because it violates the writers sense of
moral justice, he flings his poo at the policies.

This false choice modeling of modern political rhetoric gets to another
reality that lies at the heart of our politics. All of it is
progressive. The various camps, conservative, libertarian, liberal, and
so on are all operating within the larger progressive framework which is
built on the assumption that the future must be a glorious one as we in
the present are compelled to work toward that glorious future. G.
Patrick Lynch, the author of that piece, is no different than
Ocasio-Cortez in this regard.

The reason that many Americans, mostly those who used to identify as
conservative or right-wing, admire what Bukele is doing is the
practicality of it. Our political space is littered with discount
preachers like G. Patrick Lynch, waving their bony fingers at us while
listing off our sins. The stage is packed with dreamers who conjured
creative visions of a glorious future that work only in the minds of the
dreamer. What we lack are men willing to use the state to solve actual
problems.

In the end, the reason that things seem to be coming apart is that our
politics are dominated by bourgeois posers who have no practical
knowledge, so they spend their days conjuring clever word games to play
with one another. The point is never to solve a problem, but to
establish one side or the other has the king of the moral high ground,
which exists only in their imaginations. The moral high ground is just a
place in the stands, far away from the action.
