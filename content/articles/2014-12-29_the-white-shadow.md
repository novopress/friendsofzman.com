Back in the 1970’s there was a TV drama called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Shadow" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">The White Shadow</a>. It was a classic white man’s
burden story popular in that era. The white man would learn the wonders
of diversity, while helping the minorities rise from the ghetto to
something better. Back then it was what passed for cutting edge. It was
also fairly dull and no one watched it. Finally after three seasons the
network threw in the towel.

Today, of course, the white man would be routinely humiliated in each
episode in an attempt to atone for his whiteness. The difference is it
would not be a TV show but real life. According to America’s newspaper
of record, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">the White Shadow is suing the New York
City schools</a> for discrimination.

*A Bronx teacher says being a white man at his mostly black and Latino
middle school has made him a target for unfair treatment — including
being denied a key to the restroom for three years.*

*Paugh William Shadow of upstate Port Jervis charges he was
discriminated against as a white man at MS 391, according to a Manhattan
Supreme Court lawsuit he filed against the city and the Department of
Education.*

*Shadow claims he was falsely accused of corporal punishment, using
derogatory language and leaving his post; and that school administrators
refused to back him up on disciplinary matters and failed to reimburse
him after he bought materials for his science-lab students.*

*The charges, including an allegation he marched sixth-graders up and
down a set of stairs for more than five minutes as a means of
discipline, were dismissed, he claims.*

*Shadow says he “was humiliated in front of his peers” and that school
officials “discriminated against \[him\] due to his gender and race.” He
is seeking unspecified damages.*
