One of the stranger things about the political system that has evolved
since the end of the Cold War is the declining reality of politicians.
No, not their declining grasp on reality, which is a real thing. It is
the fact that our politicians are less and less like normal human beings
and more like sketches of human beings. As the role of politician has
become more of a role, performed by someone good at public performance,
their back stories have grown smaller and less important.

Go back to the last two Cold War presidents and you see men with long
and detailed back stories that were relatable. Reagan was the midwestern
guy who went to Hollywood to become a star. He ended up on television as
a pitchman but became the head of the actor’s union. Poppy Bush came
from an old blue blood family. He was in the war and then had a life in
politics. He was even the head spy for turn. We knew a lot about these
men before they entered the White House.

The first post-Cold War president was a different matter. We know a lot
about his time in Arkansas, mostly because of he and his wife’s personal
corruption, but none of that was known before he hit the national stage.
It was only after he was in the White House that his backstory came into
focus. How much of it is true and how much of it is missing is something
we will never know. Bill Clinton was the first president who started out
as mostly an idea, a sketch of a man, rather than a real person.

Bush the Dull was another poorly drawn sketch. His backstory never got
much attention at all, other than his wild days. His bio was mostly
inherited from his father, other than the hints of his prior drug
taking. It is easy to forget, and many would like to forget, but Bush
was sold as an updated Reagan. He was the best of the old line
Republicans combined with the social conservatism of the new
Republicans. Like Clinton, George Bush was fitted to the role, not the
other was around.

Obama may go down as the quintessential liberal democratic politician,
because he was pretty much an actor hired for the role. Central casting
sketched out the ideal liberal democratic Progressive. He was one part
black leading man, one part urban sophisticate, one part mysterious
foreigner and one part post-racial.  This was poured into the mold of
the former three letter heroes. Obama was FDR, JFK, MLK and RFK all
rolled into one character. He was the first Mary Sue president.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but when Reagan entered the White
House, the media was full of people who knew Reagan going back to his
youth. Like presidents before him, this was part of the getting to know
him process. We had a lot of Clinton chums turn up in the media, usually
from jail, but at least they were people who knew the man before he was
famous. To this day we have precious few people who have come forward to
talk about the young Obama.

The we got Trump. If Obama is the epitome of liberal democratic
politics, Trump is the epitome of modern business ethics. He created a
brand first then he used that brand to create business opportunities. He
is “fake it until you make it” in the flesh. His life was as the brand
manager of Donald Trump the brand. In the whirl of self-promotion, a
swarm of ever changing characters would work various deals that always
relied on someone in the room being the mark.

This is why Trump struggled as president. He remained the brand manager,
but instead of being surrounded by sharps who knew how to fleece a mark,
he was surrounded by naïfs who had no political skills. It turned out
that commercial real estate is the low minors relative to the rough and
tumble world of imperial politics. The Trump brand did well, but the
Trump presidency was four years of chaotic failure. This is because
Trump the brand had no role in Washington the musical.

Now we have Biden, a man with early stage dementia. For reasons no one
can explain, this shuffling corpse is supposed to be wildly popular. In
his youth, when he was able to be himself, he was as popular as rectal
exams. Then all of a sudden when he becomes a shuffling husk, he is all
the rage. It turns out that his real value was as a vessel into which
the image makers could pour the ideas for his role. Biden is the death
mask for a dying regime that does not have the decency to like still.

The presidents are not the only examples of this phenomena. Across the
political space, the characters on the stage are becoming more
two-dimensional. They are also declining in quality. Stock characters
like affable black conservative have gone from Walter Williams to
Candace Owens. The former was a real man of flesh and blood who had a
real life. The latter is just a poorly drawn concept. Before her turn as
numinous negro, she was an antiwhite activist harassing teenagers
on-line.

Poorly written characters end up in poorly written plots. Conservative
Inc. is now rallying around a man playing the role of a woman. Bruce
Jenner is no longer the guy who won an Olympic gold medal fifty years
ago. He is now a right-wing transvestite running for governor as a
collection of ideas. He is the full expression of conservatism, in that
the ideas are wholly divorced from the person. Just as America is just
an idea, Bruce Jenner is just an actor performing for the conservatives.

Liberal democracy is like the story of the ventriloquist who descends
into madness, thinking his dummy has come alive. Instead of the
ventriloquist putting words into the mouth of the dummy, it is the dummy
in control. Instead of actors performing the roles required for liberal
self-government, we are now in a world where the garishly festooned
actors dictate the terms of liberal self-government. The increasingly
freakish cast members are writing the script as they invent their roles.

This is why modern America increasingly feels like colonialism. The
people in charge are not only alien to us, but they are relatively
unknown. A real flesh and blood character with a genuine backstory
sticks out like a sore thumb. Even Trump, with all of his flaws, was a
real person, which is why he was such an oddity. The overclass has
become alien, in part, because it is now run by poorly drawn characters
in a poorly written melodrama. America is colonialism, the mini-series.
