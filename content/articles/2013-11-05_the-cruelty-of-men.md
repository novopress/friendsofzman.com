Anyone who has played sports, committed crimes, belonged to criminal
organization, served in the military or been to prison knows that males
can be violently cruel. On that list, two are considered honorable
activities, while the other three are counted as dishonorable. Yet, the
qualities one needs to thrive in all of them are the same. You have to
be tough minded. You have to be willing to use violence to establish
your place in the group. You have to overcome physical fear and take
physical punishment.

In all cases, you will be confronted by other males who want to dominate
you, sometimes in extremely unpleasant ways. In every locker room, there
are guys trying to push around other guys. You earn respect from your
teammates by pushing back. In prison, you better be willing to kill that
guy or you’re going to be his punk. Men can be horrible to other men,
but modern times and a feminized culture push this truth to the fringes.
Still, it is an immutable part of the human condition.

Once in a while it creeps into view. A current example is the case of
Miami Dolphin’s lineman Richie Incognito. Reportedly, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">he harassed a teammate</a> to the point
where the guy quit the team and went to get psychiatric help. I’m quite
sure that every player on the team knew what was going on and many
participated in it. The victim was probably despised by everyone because
he was taking it. No man respects another man who will not fight back.

The over-class can preach the contrary in TV and movies, but no one
respects a wimp, a pussy or a punk. That’s why no one came to the guy’s
aid. Incognito is a horrible human being, by all accounts, but as far as
the other players were concerned, he was the better man. It’s terrible
and it is cruel, but it is the way men are to one another. This poor sap
will get help, but he will never play football again.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqNMjZpSbnU" rel="noopener"

can never look another man in the eye again.

Incognito has been suspended and will face some sort of punishment. As
long as he can play the position, he will get work and be welcomed by
other players. They may think he is a bad guy, but they will respect
him. That’s the other side of this sort of thing and why campaigns
against bullying are pointless. Men, by nature, respect the bully more
than the bullied. In the evolution of man, being counted on to fight is
an important asset. When the other tribe is coming for your women, the
wimp is a liability.
