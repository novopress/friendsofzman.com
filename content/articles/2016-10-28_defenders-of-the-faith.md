The other day, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/opinion/campaign-stops/what-the-rights-intellectuals-did-wrong.html?_r=1"
target="_blank">this Ross Douthat column</a> was sent to me and posted
here in the comments. The reason is Ross appears to be riffing on some
of my themes, particularly with regards to the managerial elite. It’s
rare that anyone uses the language of James Burnham, much less his
ideas, so I can see why people would assume some connection. I doubt
Douthat reads this blog, but I’m flattered nonetheless. I know he reads
Steve Sailer, so maybe he has run across this site too.

The thing is, Douthat is a scribe for hire and the people paying his
rent are not much interested in a bare knuckled critique of the status
quo. There’s that and the fact that he falls into the same trap as the
rest of the Conservative Industrial Complex. That is, he has spent too
long getting high off his own supply. By that I mean he largely accepts,
as gospel, the marketing materials that have spewed out of conservative
media for the last three decades. Specifically, that Official
Conservatism™ is a mass movement.

Mass movements appeal to those seeking to shed their individual identity
and take on that of the cause they admire. A practical organization,
like political party or an issue group, appeals to those seeking to
increase their status by attaining practical goals like winning office
or pushing through some policy change. Somewhere in the Reagan years,
the people leading the political fights on the Right began to think they
were “happy warriors” leading a quasi-religious movement, putting
principle ahead of achievement.

At the same time, they were taking advantage of the expanding
opportunities for self-enrichment that comes from rising to the top of
political organizations. Many members of the conservative commentariat
have become fabulously rich, while the lesser lights enjoy six figure
incomes and comfortable lifestyles paid for by non-profits and the tax
payers. John Kasich, one of those happy warriors, is worth north of $20
million, despite working in government jobs his entire life. Not bad for
the son of a milkman.

Douthat and the other “reformers from within” can’t bring themselves to
face this reality. The closest they come is when it comes to the Bush
years.

This sounds remarkably similar to the excuses made for Soviet communism,
by Marxist academics in the West. They could not excuse the murder and
squalor that were the inevitable end of communism, so they argued that
the Russians had simply done it wrong. If they had only listened to the
academics, things would be different. That’s Douthat’s claim with the
Iraq invasion. He can’t admit it was a horrible blunder and the natural
result of elite “conservatism.” Instead, he says it was just a good idea
poorly executed.

The bulk of his brief is just an extended rant about the horribleness of
the Dirt People.

I’d offer a more sober interpretation. What happened in the late 80’s is
that so-called conservative intellectuals figured out they could get as
fabulously rich as their liberal buddies by slapping the word
“conservative” on just about anything and selling it to decent
people, claiming the proceeds were going to finance the fight against
the Left. The reason the Dirt People are pissed off is they have finally
wised up to the fact it was all just a hustle. They’re pissed because
they were made to look like fools by people they trusted.

The somewhat comical part of the column is in his conclusion.

This is the heroin addict saying the cure is more heroin. This is the
head of a company in bankruptcy saying only he can lead the company back
to profitability. This is the nobleman, trapped in his castle, offering
to lead the peasant revolt. It’s also an offensively idiotic
characterization of what’s happening. Exactly no one imagines Trump as a
strongman sent to sweep away the over class. That’s the sort of thing
guys like Ross Douthat tell themselves so they can feel like heroes for
supporting Clinton.

The fact is, democracy inevitably leads to one party rule. This is the
lesson of history. If there is going to be an alternative to the
dominant orthodoxy, it is going to be an alternative, not an echo. That
means it will be anti-managerial, anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian.
It will be opposed to the cornerstone beliefs of the ruling class. You
can defend it or oppose it, but there can be no compromise. That’s the
lesson of Conservative Inc’s failure. They sought compromise where there
could be none, so they just sold out instead.
