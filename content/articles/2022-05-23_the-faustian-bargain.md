**Note:** The
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/common-good-conservativism/"

discourse on the proposed replacement for originalism in conservative
jurisprudence. The Sunday Thoughts

Over the last few years, it has become increasingly popular to examine
what went wrong with the conservative movement. This was mostly the
result of Trump winning the Republican nomination, despite universal
opposition from conservatives. At that point it was no longer possible
to ignore the collapse of conservatism. Prior to 2016, the movement was
the gatekeeper for the party. Trump and the Dirt People kicked open the
gates and found nothing worth keeping inside.

One result of this is the sprouting of proposed alternatives like Yoram
Hazony’s national conservatism, common good conservativism and
integralism. Libertarians, of course, maintain the fantasy that this is
their time. There are certainly others working to produce something to
fill the void on the Right. All of these proposed alternative start with
a basic claim that conservatism failed. None of these new conservatisms
bother to think too hard about why Buckley conservatism failed.

This is what makes <a
href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/liberalism-driving-the-speed-limit/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> from Paul Gottfried
important. He was around when many of the critical turns of the
conservative movement were made, so he has a perspective on it that few
have today. Most of the main players from the growth phase of Buckley
conservatism are gone now. With them went the personal disputes that
ended up shaping what became mainstream conservatism in the 1980’s. The
one thing the Left has right is that politics is always personal.

Gottfried tries to do three things in the post. One is to bring
attention to the recent scholarship on Harry Jaffa, who was a central
figure in the debates about the shape and direction of conservatism.
Then there is the fact that there was a time when debate was possible
within conservatism. Others have noted that there was an interregnum in
which sensitive topics like race and immigration could be debated. That
window closed in the 1990’s, eventually taking the public square with
it.

The main point of Gottfried’s post is to place the blame for this and
the collapse of conservatism at the feet of the neoconservatives. Before
the neoconservatives gained power, it was possible for Harry Jaffa and
Mel Bradford to live together. Jaffa was largely responsible for the
Lincoln fetish among conservatives. He claimed the Civil War and the
Reconstruction amendments were a perfecting of the original Constitution
by reincorporating the sentiments of the Declaration.

Bradford was a Southerner and a Southern conservative. This not only
placed him at odds with Jaffa’s reimagining of the Founding and Civil
War, but it put him on the losing side of the internal struggles within
conservatism. He was on the Russel Kirk wing of the Right, which was
purged by Buckley in the 1980’s. In fact, Bradford was one of the first
to be hurled into the void by conservatives. Paul Gottfried blames this
urge to purge squarely on the neoconservatives.

There is truth to it, but the desire to excommunicate rivals exists in
all movements, so it is hardly unique to the neocons. The question is
how were they able to change the rules in order to disqualify the
arguments of their opponents? After all, no one was purged for being
factually incorrect. The dispute between the paleos and neos was over
moral questions and that is where Jaffa comes back into the room. It is
Jaffa’s work that gave the neocons the chance to rig morality to their
advantage.

The central claim of Harry Jaffa is that the Constitution was an
imperfect effort to encode the sentiments of the Declaration into the
political framework of the new nation created out of the break from
England. The contradictions within the constitutional order eventually
led to the Civil War. This allowed for some necessary corrections to
advance the nation down the road toward the sentiments in the
Declaration. Lincoln becomes the Moses of this new nation forged in
liberty.

Of course, this requires a reading of early American history that steps
outside of the actual facts and written accounts of the Founders. It
also requires a new version of the events leading up to the Civil War.
That was all made easy because it proved a path forward for
conservatives to embrace egalitarianism. They could finally claim that
their opponents on the Left were the real racist because Lincoln was a
Republican, freed the slaves and said stuff about all men being equal.

That is not being fair to Jaffa, who deserves a much more through
debunking than time permits, but this was his contribution to
conservatism. The cult of Lincoln he created for the Right cut them
loose from the old conservativism, rooted in the natural order, and
provided them with a new moral foundation. The New Right would be about
equality and liberty. The New Left, in contrast, would be about equality
and justice, thus tying the two together through egalitarianism.

Here is a <a href="https://americanmind.org/features/no-new-normal/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on the same site as the
Gottfried post, in which the editors reject the new normal of American
politics. Everything is good until this. “In reality, race is <a
href="https://americanmind.org/features/no-new-normal/demographics-are-not-destiny/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">not the ultimate fact</a> of human
identity or the central problem of American life. Different ethnic
populations have different general tendencies, but not different natural
rights. Everyone is capable of learning to live well in this country,
but only if we confidently endorse both our geographical and cultural
boundaries.”

The linked post in that quote is worth reading, as it rips the mask from
the “new conservatism” and exposes it as the old conservatism. The great
fork in the road, the shadow that hangs over human history, is biology.
The story of man is not one tale with many chapters, but many stories of
many people, all of whom have their own unique understanding of
themselves and how they should live. The genuine man of the Right
understands this and accepts it. Equality, in short, is inhuman.

When you pick up one end of a stick, you pick up the other. This is the
problem that destroyed 20th century conservatism. They were offered a
Faustian bargain from the likes of Harry Jaffa. They accepted the
egalitarianism of the radicals as their foundation stone and in exchange
they were rewarded with riches. Conservatism was once again *Northern
Conservatism* and followed the same path that another Southerner <a
href="https://counter-currents.com/2012/11/robert-lewis-dabney-on-conservatism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">observed</a> about them in the 19th
century.
