A recurring theme of the ongoing war on society by the Left is how the
Left is trying to pull the roof down on Western Civilization. All of the
ideas about building a Utopian future have fallen away and what’s left
is nothing but an urge to destroy. They are like spoiled children,
unhappy with not getting their way, so they  are determined to make the
rest of us carry their misery. Immigration is a great example.

today</a>.

*Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in French cities on
Saturday to condemn violence in Gaza, defying a ban imposed after
demonstrators marched on two synagogues in Paris last weekend and
clashed with riot police.*

*A Reuters photographer said demonstrators in northern Paris launched
projectiles at riot police, who responded by firing teargas canisters
and stun grenades.*

*Demonstrators also climbed on top of a building and burned an Israeli
flag. At least one car was set on fire.*

*A police spokesman said that 38 demonstrators had been arrested by
early evening and that the clashes were dying down.*

In a sane world, the French people would not care all that much about
what was happening between natives in a foreign land. If it were one of
her colonies, maybe it would make the news. Otherwise, the French would
not be terribly vexed about what was happening between Arabs and Jews.
Of course, these riots are not caused by French people. They are caused
by Arabs imported into France for no reason.

*French President Francois Hollande said he understood emotional
responses to the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in a flare-up
of hostilities with Israel but would not allow violence to spill over
into France.*

*“That’s why I asked the interior minister, after an investigation, to
ensure that such protests would not take place,” he told journalists
during a visit to Chad.*

*Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve justified bans in Paris, the
Sarcelles suburb and the Mediterranean city of Nice by saying the
security risk was too great, **prompting outrage from left-wing and
pro-Palestinian groups**.*

So there you are. Left-wing groups pushed to have Arabs imported into
France and now they are helping them burn down French cities and attack
French Jews. What possible reason, other than national suicide, could
there be for importing these savages and then letting them run wild in
French cities?

Make no mistake, these “pro-Palestinian groups” are nothing more than
low-IQ savages. The reason they are in France is they made their lands
in the Levant unlivable. Their fellow Arabs despise them and refuse to
let them into their lands. The Jews, of course, want them off the land,
so they conspire to ship them north.

That’s the other part of it. Every open borders group on earth is
financed by and organized by Jews. That means the Jews in France are
being assaulted by Arabs, because Jewish immigration groups in Europe
conspired with Israel to ship the Arabs into France, where they set
about attacking Jews. Israel hopes to get the Ashkenazim fleeing Europe
and the immigration groups weaken France.
