It seems to me that the doom and gloom crowd is increasingly unhinged. I
wish I had a nickel for every “death cross” posted on Zero Hedge in the
last year. They post negative economic reports like we are about to
succumb to the zombie apocalypse. Don’t get me wrong, I like ZH and I
get a kick out of their posts, but there’s a line between pessimism and
lunacy and they seem to cross it a lot lately. Karl Denninger is
following the same path.

*Ok, now this is a pretty nasty report...*

*The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of U.S.
retail and food services sales for January, adjusted for seasonal
variation and holiday and trading-day differences, but not for price
changes, were $439.8 billion, a decrease of 0.8 percent (±0.5%) from the
previous month, but up 3.3 percent (±0.9%) above January 2014. Total
sales for the November 2014 through January 2015 period were up 3.8
percent (±0.7%) from the same period a year ago. The November to
December 2014 percent change was unrevised from -0.9 percent (±0.3%).*

*Yuck.*

*What’s worse is the unadjusted numbers.  Keep in mind that there’s this
holiday called Christmas in December, but….*

*Retail, total, was down about **21%** unadjusted.  But what’s worse is
the **lie** in the above caption — previous-year comparisons.  **The
unadjusted January figures were up only 2.85% from January 2014, and if
you exclude cars it was only up 1.41%.  Incidentally, ex-autos sales
were down 24% sequentially.***

*You don’t need a seasonal adjustment for the same month in different
years!*

*There was one bright light — gasoline, which was down big (24%).  But
the claim that this drop in gas price would translate inexorably to
other purchases appears to be flat-out wrong.  Instead, consumers are
paying down debt and reducing their leverage — except on cars.*

*One final interesting point — non-store retailers were only up 2.57%
from last January.  **It appears that the “internet shopping craze” has
finished its large growth numbers; this has an interesting set of
implications for everyone selling and marketing on the Internet,
particularly Spamazon.***

*PS: People **are** getting drunk more — to the tune of 13.1% more over
last January.  Gee, I wonder if the lies are finally getting to ordinary
folks……*

Month to month changes in retail sales may be of importance to a
retailer trying to pay his rent. In macro economics, no one really cares
about it since holidays and seasonality play such a big part in retail.
Restaurants and flower shops do better in February than January for
obvious reasons. What matters is year over year. January 2015 was better
than January 2014. But, Karl and his cult can have none of that so they
focus on the month to month figure, which is meaningless.

As far as his comment about adjusted numbers, that’s nonsense. Lots of
retail is done on weekends. If you gain a weekend day or lose a weekend
day, it can make a big difference. The government plays games with the
numbers so a certain amount of skepticism is warranted with regard to
adjusted numbers. that does not mean all normalization of data is a
fraud.
