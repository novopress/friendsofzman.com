The season of the witch is upon us. For much of the country Halloween is
the tipping point where people head inside. It is in the close quarters
of indoor life, especially around the holidays, where the witch does her
worst work. They have the vaccine spells, supply chain voodoo, CRT
incantations and insurrectionist stories ready to go so they can
increase your misery. The witch lives to make the normal man miserable
and agitated, especially during what should be the cozy season.

This week’s show is about how to deal with the witches we call leftists,
feminists, cult-Marxists, and so. Back when I did the shows on the
radical nature of our ruling class, I said I would do a show on how to
deal with these people in our daily lives. Given this is the season of
the witch, it seemed appropriate to post the show this week. When the
kids are out trick-or-treating, you can be aware of the mother standing
in the shadows, holding a water glass full of chardonnay.

Another motivation for the show this week is Ed Dutton’s excellent
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CMWTMFR/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">book</a>, *Witches, Feminism, and the Fall of the West*.
Dutton examines the history of witches and explains that while the
fantasy version of them is probably not true, the real witches exist,
and they haunt us to this day. The real witches today are the women who
engage on social media tantrums about the latest left-wing fads. These
are the women raised on the toxic brew of feminism and cultural Marxism.

Now, you may prefer to think of these women as victims of modernity or
you may think they are in league with Old Scratch. As is often the case,
the explanation for objective reality is not as important as the
acceptance of objective reality. In this age, that reality is we are
plagued with witches who have grown so confident that they now operate
out in the open, immiserating the decent with their foul opinions. The
result is we all must now become witch-hunters, to cleanse the land of
their stench.

That is the motivation for the show this week. Another motivation is
that there seems to be an aura of despair hanging over our side. This is
the ultimate goal of the great enemy we face. They cannot destroy us
directly, so they seek to drive us to despair, so that we destroy
ourselves. The antidote to that is to have a little fun and remember
that life is for living and living as best we can. This *two-hour
special* is an effort to have a little fun while subtly discussing some
real world problems.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
