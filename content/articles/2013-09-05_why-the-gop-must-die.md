For all of my adult life, the GOP has been called the home of the Right.
If you are a conservative, however you wish to define it, you are
supposed to support the Republicans. Even when the Republican option is
is a useless squish like Mitt Romney or a beady-eyed climber like Paul
Ryan, the argument is they are better than whatever the Democrats are
offering. Bill Buckley used to say he voted for the most right-wing
electable candidate, which resulted in guys like George Bush running the
party.

The disaster that was George Bush the Younger was justified on the
grounds that he was better than Kerry or Gore. You can’t blame sensible
white people for falling for this argument. Al Gore was having a nervous
breakdown in the 2000 campaign. John Kerry is as dumb as a goldfish and
surrounded by people who are not much better. That does not change the
fact that the GOP works hand and glove with the Democrats to keep moving
the political center further to the Left. It’s always heads they win
tails we lose.

In Britain, this game worked for a long time with Tory voters, but it
appears to be getting a test from UKIP. Those weirdos attacking the
Tories from the right are not buying the old argument. They point out
that the Tories are in a partnership with the Liberals, which makes them
the enemy of the working man by definition. UKIP exists for one reason
and that is to destroy the Tory Party. Their reasoning is a fake
conservative party is worse than no conservative party. That’s true in
the US as well. We need a new party.

“conservatives” looking for an excuse to undermine their own policy.
We’re supposed to believe that these guys want to reduce the size,
expense and scope of government. Yet every time they have the chance,
they try to expand the size, expense and scope of government. If you are
a small government type, this is why you should be sitting out
elections. If you keep voting for these idiots, you are the idiot. The
only orderly way forward is to destroy the GOP.
