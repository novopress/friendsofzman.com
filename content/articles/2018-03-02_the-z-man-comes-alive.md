Everyone is vexed with me for bailing on Trump. It is perfectly
understandable. Sensible white Americans have been conditioned to defend
their guy against all attacks. It’s how we ended up with the thoroughly
rotten George Bush and his neocon henchmen. Everyone was so busy
defending Bush from the liberal loonies, no one noticed that he was
actually worse than the liberal loonies. It is probably a lesson the
American honky will never learn.

That’s why this episode is dedicated to bashing Trump. Just 60 minutes
of over the top Trump trashing. OK, that’s not true. In fact, this
episode is certified 100% free of Trump bashing. Still, I have been very
black pilled this week, so it is not my normal light hearted effort. I
probably should have called it “The Black Pill Podcast” but I wanted to
do the Frampton bit for some reason. That and I did the episode with a
sherman in my hand.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
