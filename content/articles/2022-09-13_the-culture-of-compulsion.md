Last month, conservative media was buzzing about a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">British pick up artist</a> being banned from the
internet. On the same day, all of his social media accounts were
shutdown and his payment processors dropped him. Conservatives noticed
this incident because the victim did not look white. It turns out that
he is half-black, so for American conservatives he is an ideal victim.
It is the DR3 exception to the “they are private companies” principle of
conservatism.

Amusingly, the regime media felt the need to address the issue, probably
for the same reason so-called conservatives noticed the story. An iron
law of the new religion states that any time a nonwhite cries out, it
must be noticed. The New York Times helpfully stepped in and solved the
problem. They <a href="https://archive.ph/LdCbx" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">noticed</a> his banning but spent the bulk of the
article explaining how his white half caused his black half to violate
all of the important rules of the one true faith.

The racial part has another angle. Andrew Tate made the fatal error of
turning up on banned shows like Alex Jones.
<a href="https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Tariq Nasheed</a> is every bit as “misogynistic” as
Andrew Tate and he adds in wacky conspiracy theories. He makes Alex
Jones look like a piker when it comes to the conspiracy stuff. On the
other hand, he is viewed as left-wing, mostly because of his
over-the-top hatred of white people. He gets to hate women as much as he
likes on social media as a result.

Putting aside the racial angle, the stunning part of the coverage was
that no one dared ask how these allegedly independent private companies
came to the same conclusion within minutes of one another. It is quite a
coincidence. If this had rolled out over a period of weeks and one
platform held the line, then you could argue that it was mostly a case
of monkey see, monkey do. In this case, it looked like a coordinated
effort, yet no one asked who was coordinating it.

Of course, it is possible there is no coordination at all. The people
running these tech firms are all alpha clones from the Central Hatchery
and Conditioning Centre of the managerial state. They all believe the
same things about themselves and the world they see themselves destined
to manage. No one has to tell the prison guards what to do when they see
an inmate scaling the wire. Like a school of fish, these people could be
naturally reacting to what they see.

They could also have set up a clearinghouse for dealing with this stuff.
That has happened in the past. They <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/415m-settlement-reached-in-silicon-valley-tech-suit-over-salary-fixing/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">created</a> an ad hoc committee to
coordinate hiring in order to suppress wages. They also like to
outsource this work to the same two companies, the SPLC and the ADL,
which can do the coordination for them. It would be interesting to hear
what they have to say about his, but to date no one in the media has
raised the issue with them or to a politician.

It is not just the Silicon Valley companies illegally and immorally
colluding to violate the civil rights of Americans. It appears the
banking cartel is <a
href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/new_york/gun-ammunition-purchases-by-credit-card-will-be-coded/article_5e81114c-307b-11ed-9d5f-8bd1e30f121a.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">colluding</a> to undermine the Second
Amendment rights of Americans. They may also be pressuring others to
follow on with their own measures. UPS is <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ups-new-rule-change-attack-gun-industry"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">getting</a> into the act. As we see with
tech censorship, there is a whole lot of coincidental timing to this. It
is almost as if there is someone working behind the scenes coordinating
it.

One possible hand in this is the regime itself. We now know that the
Biden administration <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-asked-twitter-why-alex-berenson-wasnt-banned-from-platform-lawsuit-reveals"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">works</a> with Twitter to ban opponents.
We also know they send the FBI to social media companies to threaten
them if necessary. They sent a group of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OGodujfD04" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">goons</a> over to Facebook to tell them to censure the
Hunter Biden laptop story. Given the grotesque authoritarianism of the
regime, it should not shock anyone if we learn that they have created an
unofficial Ministry of Truth.

This brings us back to that key question. Why is it that no one in the
mass media, even so-called conservative media, ever asks about the
coordination? Why is it no one noticed that the streaming platforms
appeared to be ready with a public relations campaign right after the
George Floyd incident? The next day they all had reworked their
interface to promote pro-black content. You would think at least one
person would wonder out loud about who is organizing this stuff.

One reason is fear. Every day that Haitian halfwit is sent out by the
Biden regime to do a song and dance routine in the pressroom. She is an
angry simpleton reading from a script so this should be easy money for a
snarky reporter. Ask a question that makes her look more foolish than
normal and you get fifteen minutes of fame. The only one who dares utter
a discouraging word is Peter Doocy from Fox News and his questions are a
great example of pulling your punches.

The reason the rest of them nod along pretending that the moron reading
answers from a book is perfectly normal is they do not want to lose
their job. Jean-Pierre could literally be flinging her poo at them and
they will treat her like a queen. They say there is no dignity in show
business. It is even more true in political show business. In tyrannical
politics, groveling is the coin of court. No one in the media dares look
up from their groveling for fear of losing their access.

The other reason is that none of them think to ask about who may or may
not be behind what looks like coordination. It is the Pauline Kael
effect. She was the crackpot film critic in the 1970’s who is allegedly
said that Nixon could not have won because she did not know anybody who
voted for him. The quote used is not real, the <a
href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/10/The-Fraudulent-Factoid-That-Refuses-to-Die"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">real quote</a> is actually worse, but the
sentiment is very real. The Cloud People live insular lives in which
everyone has the same attitudes.

From the point of view of the managerial class, it is perfectly sensible
for the tech oligarchs to censure speech. It is the responsible thing to
do. They are baffled as to why anyone is upset by this. Not only are
they not offended by censorship, but they would also be shocked if these
firms were not coordinating their efforts. It is why they mount pressure
campaigns against holdouts. Teaming up to suppress speech is really just
a good example of political unity when you think about it.

When you step back and look at what is happening, it is remarkable.
Managerialism in the West has achieved something that the Bolsheviks and
Nazis were never able to accomplish at their peak. The operation of the
managerial class is entirely informal, a habit of mind, rather than a
set of rules. The communists and fascists had to rely on physical
compulsion to maintain control. That requires a set of rules that can be
enforced quickly by the regime.

The managerial class has created a culture which maintains their power.
The reason the Biden White House is sending goons out to rough people up
is that from their point of view it is the moral thing to do. Those old
rules against doing such things do not register for them, because they
lie outside the managerial morality. For the same reason no one asks any
Andrew Tate was targeted by the tech giants, no one wonders if roughing
up political opponents is against the rules.

For those familiar with the intellectual history of radicalism, we have
arrived at a rather ironic moment. The West is now controlled by a
culture of compulsion. The reason the people in the institutions exist
is to compel behavior. The point of the nutty fads and grotesque
violations of liberal norms is to force people, at the very minimum, to
tolerate that which should never be tolerated. Ours is a society
evolving around hierarchical humiliation rituals that have no practical
purpose.
