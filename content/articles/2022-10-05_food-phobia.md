Food plays an important role in every culture. Since culture evolves in
a place and that place has certain foods not known in other places, food
helps ground the culture in a time and place, which helps ground the
people in a time and place. A big part of the answer to the only
question that matters – who are we – is the place where the answer was
created by our ancestors. It is why our holidays have special foods.
They help remind the people of the answer to the big question.

In the West, fear of food is also a big cultural item. For some reason,
Western people remain convinced that their food is out to get them. From
time to time certain foods have been banned. In pre-modern times the
reasons ranged from the superstitious to the ritual, while in modern
times “science” is the blame. In this age, we are told every day that
something in our diet is trying to kill us. These days, people are often
defined by the foods they think are plotting against them.

Fear of food seems to track with belief. The more ideological the
person, the more likely they are to be paranoid about food. Vegans and
vegetarians are almost always in one of the subcultures on what we call
the Left. The exception will be someone who got it into his head that
something is bad for his training regimen. Otherwise, when someone tells
you they are a vegan, and they almost always tell you that as soon as
you meet them, they are telling you their politics.

This may have been true before ideology replaced religion. When he was
not busy inventing the triangle, Pythagoras was running a cult. A big
part of his cult was the foods that were prohibited. Of course,
religions of the book have dietary laws. Jews are not supposed to eat
pork or shellfish. For a long time, Catholics were not supposed to eat
meat on Friday. Since religion seeks to answer the big question or at
least contribute to the answer, it makes sense that it would have food
rules.

In this age of disbelief, food fads seem to fill the void for some
people. Vegans and vegetarians are the obvious examples. They make a big
deal out of their food, as if the consumption of the correct items is a
sacrament. Keto people are not far behind in this regard, but they tend
to be fascinated with the math of it. A big part of the keto subculture
is tracking the macros. Every meal is a math puzzle. Get the numbers
right and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhr%C3%ADmnir" rel="noopener"

The biggest food fetish by far in this age is the fear of certain foods.
Stories like this <a
href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/03/white-rice-is-just-as-bad-for-your-heart-as-candy-study-suggests/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a> in the New York Post are a daily
occurrence. Some food gets the stink eye because “science” claims that
it is plotting to kill you. In this case, white rice is part of the
conspiracy known as heart disease. A billion Chinamen eat rice every day
and have relatively low heart disease rates. This obvious fact will be
ignored and some people will accept the claim that rice is a killer.

Interestingly, the science of food is riddled with science denialism.
Heart disease, for example, is most certainly a genetic issue. This old
<a
href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/even-george-w-bush-has-heart-disease/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from Jayman on the topic is a
good explainer on the genetic reality of heart disease. Our health
outcomes are probably 98% genetic, but the “food science” people insist
that arranging the right items on the dinner plate will magically bring
good health. Food science is a good reminder that we are as
superstitious as ever.

Of course, admitting that genetics, not diet, is the key driver of human
health would be bad for business, so “food science” embraces the blank
slate. If the reason people eating a Mediterranean diet have a low
incidence of heart disease is due to them being Mediterranean, then you
are not selling many cookbooks. On the other hand, if you claim that all
people are exactly the same and the differences we see are due to things
like food magic, then you can sell a lot of cookbooks.

There is the theological angle as well. The New Religion treats human
biodiversity as a heresy, one of the deadly sins, in fact, so we cannot
notice that certain people seem to have certain diseases while other
people have different diseases. Just as dietary laws are part of all
religions, the New Religion has embraced food magic. The rice in your
cupboard that is plotting your demise has nothing to do with the rice
that seems to like the people of East Asia. Peace be upon you.

The truth is, outside of the extremes and controlling for obvious
poisons, food plays little role in your health. What matters is your
over all calorie intake and the balance of nutrients you get from the
food. If you get enough calories and the right mix of nutrients, you
will be as healthy as your code indicates. Eat too much and you get fat.
Eat the wrong things and maybe you get scurvy or rickets. Otherwise,
your food intake is just not all that important to your health.

In this age, the issue with food is the extremes. The rising incidence
of diabetes is driven, in part, by the fatness of people. Demographics
play a role as certain people are more prone to both obesity and
diabetes¹, so as they grow in number their diseases will grow in
proportion. Even so, Americans eat too much and eat far too many
calories from carbohydrate laden foods. Stand outside of a Starbucks and
you will see fat women waddling out with what look like deserts every
morning.

Interestingly, the one thing that is never mentioned by the fear mongers
is the vast array of chemicals in prepared foods. It is just assumed
they are safe, but we really do not know if long term consumption of
sodium nitrate or guar gum has an impact on the human body. Big food is
never going to pay anyone to study it and they will never let government
look into it. The recent Covid experience should make clear who calls
the shots when it comes to public health.

Putting that aside, the rise in claimed food allergies and weird diets
is probably linked to the collapse of the culture and local community.
It always returns to the answer to the big question – who are we? If you
are not allowed to answer in the affirmative, then you are left to
answer in the negative. Instead of being what your people eat, so to
speak, you are what you fear on the dinner plate. A negative food
identity fills the void left by a positive cultural identity.

¹Some people with reading disabilities interpret this to mean obesity is
caused solely by genetics, rather than calorie intake. This is an error
on your part. Genetics plays a role in everything, including obesity,
but it is not the only factor.
