There is an old expression in politics that roughly says the most
successful politicians are blessed with the right enemies. William Weld,
a long time Massachusetts politician, was enormously gifted, until
alcoholism got the better of him. He could have reshaped state politics
and become a national figure, but he ran into the far wilier Billy
Bulger at the local level and the more powerful duo of John Kerry and
Ted Kennedy at the national level, so he never lived up to his promise.

We seem to be seeing the opposite with Donald Trump, who has better
political instincts than most seasoned professionals, even though his
only political experience was at the very top of the game eight years
ago. Imagine a fighter stepping into the ring for the first time and the
opponent is the reigning world champion. Then imagine that guy winning,
and you see the enormity of 2016. Since then, the system has thrown
everything at the man, and he is still going.

The main reason Trump continues to move toward the Republican nomination
and a general election rematch is he is blessed with the best enemies.
The two Federal court cases are now stalled indefinitely. In both cases,
the reason for the delay is the chief inquisitor appointed by the Biden
administration is proving to be an incompetent fanatic who cannot stop
lying to the court. In the most recent example, he was forced to admit
the FBI tampered with evidence and lied about it.

A smarter, more sober minded prosecutor would have used the process to
tangle Trump up in a myriad of potential scandals that both drained his
resources and created a black cloud over his campaign. Instead, the
deranged Jack Smith thought he could get into a street fight with a guy
who prefers street fights. In the fullness of time, Jack Smith will be
remembered as one of Trump’s dumbest adversaries. The guy has managed to
turn the power of the Federal government into a liability.

Then we have the locals who seem to have been drawn from central casting
if central casting is located at the diversity department of a mental
asylum. In Georgia, Fani Willis turned herself into a living argument
against affirmative action. In New York, Alvin Bragg has managed to make
a sham trial into a daily platform for Trump to do what he does best,
which is walking around New York City, sweet talking the locals, who
line up every day to see The Man fight the man.

The question is where will all of this lead. It is a mortal lock that
Trump is convicted of whatever it is they claim he did wrong. It is also
a guarantee that the third world judge sentences Trump to jail time. He
has threatened Trump with jail over Trump talking publicly about the
court case. This judge is stupid and insane, so we are most likely going
to see a situation in which the Secret Service faces off with the State
of New York about how to jail a former president.

It remains to be seen how this plays with the public, but no one in
power actually cares about public opinion. They just use it as a fig
leaf. It is safe to assume that the people running the Republican Party
would love to dump Trump, so this might be their chance to remove him
from the ballot. The trouble is, that means the end of the party and
even the dullards of Conservative Inc should be able to see it. Then
again, “conservative” is just the long spelling of “retarded.”

This is where Trump’s luck may come into play. The guy thrives on chaos
and what will happen this summer with regards to the nomination is
chaos. In other words, his opponents are creating for him the conditions
in which he does best. By doing nothing more than existing, he will put
party leadership in a vice. One jaw is defending him against rogue state
courts and the other jaw is the people who call the shots in Washington,
demanding the party remove him from the ballot.

It gets better, or at least more amusing. Joe Biden is clearly a mess
physically and mentally, which will not get better with time. The other
day he was leaving the White House, and it appears he soiled his diaper.
Even former NFL players are
[laughing](https://www.theblaze.com/news/ab-fearless-whitlock-trump-biden)
about Biden’s physical and mental health problems. Biden’s growing
incoherence will not be helped by black sports stars making diaper jokes
about him. The precious black vote follows the lead of their black
stars.

The solution to the Biden problem is to remove him from the ballot at
the convention and swap in someone new. Biden is told to stand aside at
the convention, maybe have him deliver one last speech in which he
“graciously” steps aside for someone new, who then picks a running mate
that is not the butt of jokes. In other words, the solution to the Biden
problem might be the chaos option. Upend the whole race at the
last-minute hoping that something good arises from the chaos.

None of this should lead anyone to think Trump will win the general
election or be allowed to assume office. The people in charge have other
more effective ways to block Trump if these efforts fail. The way to bet
right now is that the Republican Party removes Trump from the ballot at
the convention, as he will be sitting in a jail somewhere in New York or
maybe under house arrest. Even so, that will be just one log on the
bonfire of chaos that is coming.

In the end, Trump is lucky in that he is getting exactly what he needs
to thrive politically, but what he is, and always has been, is a
wrecking ball. His role in the late empire political process is to
fulfill another old expression, those whom God wishes to destroy, he
first deprives of reason. Trump makes the managerial class insane, which
results in chaos, the thing on which Trump feeds. That cycle of chaotic
madness is now heading to a climax this summer.
