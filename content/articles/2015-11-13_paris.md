Upon disembarkation, the leader of the Muslims, Tariq bin Zayid, ordered
the Islamic fleet burned, explaining that “We have not come here to
return. Either we conquer and establish ourselves here, or we perish.”

“Near the river Owar \[Loire\], the two great hosts of the two languages
and the two creeds \[Islam and Christianity\] were set in array against
each other. The hearts of Abd al-Rahman, his captains and his men were
filled with wrath and pride, and they were the first to begin to fight.
The Muslim horsemen dashed fierce and frequent forward against the
battalions of the Franks, who resisted manfully, and many fell dead on
either side, until the going down of the sun.”

“The men of the north stood as motionless as a wall, they were like a
belt of ice frozen together, and not to be dissolved, as they slew the
Arab with the sword. The Austrasians \[Franks\], vast of limb, and iron
of hand, hewed on bravely in the thick of the fight; it was they who
found and cut down the Saracen’s king \[Rahman\].”
