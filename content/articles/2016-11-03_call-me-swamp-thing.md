Way back in the Clinton Administration, I had the opportunity to
socialize with Chris Mathews at a small dinner function. It was one of
those charity deals where they have some important person give a little
speech and chit-chat with the attendees. This was before Mathews had his
mental breakdown so he was good fun, despite being a Lefty. People
forget that he was not great fan of the Clintons, even though he was
always a loyal party man.

This was the mid-90’s and the Drudge Report had just gone up as a
website. Americans were flocking to computer stores to buy modems so
they could use that AOL disk they got in the mail. I forget what we were
discussing, but at some point I got the impression that Mathews simply
had no idea the internet existed. I made mention of something about
on-line news and Mathews had this puzzled look, then said, “Oh, you mean
that internet thing.” He was unaware of the biggest technological event
since the steam engine.

It is a story I like to tell as way to illustrate that people in the
national media don’t live in America like the rest of us. The old joke
in DC was that the big media outfits sent their foreign correspondents
to cover stories in Ohio. That’s an exaggeration, but our national media
does live in bubble. They can, when they feel like it, do a good job
telling the rest of us about the doings in politics, but otherwise they
are baffled about what happens out among the Dirt People. You see that

Note the pleading in there about how “serious conservative journalists”
are anti-Trump. McArdle plays a libertarian on approved media sites.
Libertarian in this context is the house broken type that Progressives
will tolerate. These are the low-tax liberals, who are the first to
answer the call when it comes time to make war on the crime-thinkers. In
the current crisis, this manifests as obsequious rumpswabbery where the
“libertarian” comes close to begging the loopy liberal woman for mercy.

The not-so-subtle condescension here is what always gets me about these
people. Instead of “right-wing readers” I suspect she wanted to write
“slack-jawed yokels.” In case that’s not clear, she makes sure her
Progressive friends all know that she thinks people like you are loony.
Most of what passes for conservative or libertarian opinion in the media
is really just moral signalling. In this case, McArdle wants her
Progressive friends to remember she is not one of those disgusting Trump
people.

The defining feature of Official Conservatism™ and its retarded little
brother, Reason Libertarianism, is a fear of being “ghettoized” which is
the scare word for being left out of the Progressive party circuit. They
fear that more than death. If the price of admission means mocking and
ridiculing the people whose interests they claim to champion, that’s a
price they are more than happy to pay.

I suspect she had to fight back tears writing those two graphs.

Call me Swamp Thing.

One of the amusing aspects of these columns is that people like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_McArdle"
target="_blank">McArdle</a> are just as clueless about life outside the
bubble as her moonbat friends. She positions herself as soul sister
number one, down with those loony Dirty People in the swamp, but she
would break out in hives reading the sorts of things that are coming
from the Dissident Right. The fundamentals of what is driving the
rebellion against the elites is well outside the field of vision for
people like McArdle. She does not know what she does not know.
