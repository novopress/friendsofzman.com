facing Chinese tech giant Huawei as it tries to enter the US mobile
phone market.

> A Chinese technology giant, whose telecom networking equipment is shut
> out of the U.S. due to security concerns, is bringing its high-end
> smartphone to American consumers for the first time.
>
> But a number of obstacles are blocking Huawei Technologies Co.’s path
> to success in the U.S. smartphone market.

> U.S. carriers, which distribute more than 80% of handsets in the
> country, are reluctant to work with Huawei—the world’s third-largest
> smartphone maker by shipments behind Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple
> Inc.—because of its low brand recognition and security concerns
> associated with its networking equipment, people familiar with the
> matter say. **A 2012 congressional report recommended that U.S.
> carriers avoid using Huawei gear in their networks for fear that China

> saying it operates independently of Beijing.**

Much of what goes on in the modern age requires people to deny
observable reality. China is an authoritarian state, run by a military
government, that is highly paranoid of the outside world. Paranoia about
the non-Chinese world is a feature of Chinese culture, a *permanent*
feature. The type of government can change, but the Chinese elite will
always view the rest of the world as smelly barbarians that must be kept
under control. China is probably the most chauvinistic society on earth.

The result of this is that no Chinese firm operates independent of
Beijing. Any company large enough to export to the rest of the world, or
import from the rest of the world, is in bed with the Chinese
government. More important, any tech firm big enough to play on the
global stage is deeply connected to the Chinese military, because they
could not be so big without the blessing and active support of
the People’s Liberation Army. This is something everyone knows, except
for the writers of the Wall Street Journal.

The result is trade with China comes with a hidden cost. If you move
your electronics making factory to China, they will steal your
technology. They will also do things like bake spyware and back doors
into networking gear so the the PLA can exploit US communications
networks. That means the US has to spend billions in counter-espionage
activities in order to prevent the Chinese from running off with all of
our secrets. This is just one example of the hidden costs of trade with
China.

It’s not just China. We have so-called free trade with Mexico. The
result was not trade in the way normal people think of it. What happened
was dirty US manufacturers located their plants to Mexico. Companies
looking to game the labor laws followed soon after. Mexico is not
selling us more stuff and buying more of our stuff. Mexico is just a
loophole in US labor and environmental laws. If you make lead-acid
batteries, for example, putting the battery plant in Mexico in the right
move.

The problem is those environmental costs don’t go away. <a

target="_blank">The Mexican government estimates that 10% of their
GDP</a> is lost due to the effects of environmental degradation. Go to
Mexico City and the air is like soup. Of course, environmental
degradation does not stay local. Air pollution in one place goes global
as the winds change. The fevered attempts to ban your car and lawnmower
in order to reduce carbon emissions are mostly due to “developing”
countries like China and Mexico.

Of course, you also have the labor problem. Making car batteries in the
US means people working in a car battery factory. Move those jobs to
Mexico and we do get slightly cheaper car batteries, but we get more
unemployed people. The unemployed car battery worker is not taking up a
self-actualizing career at the George Mason economics department. He’s
going on the dole or drifting down the economic scale. At low levels,
the trade-offs seem worthwhile, but once you scale this up the costs
metastasize.

There’s also another hidden cost to free trade. Donald Trump rode to the
White House on the promise of reorienting trade in the patriotic
direction. All the beautiful people thought the issue was settled.
Everyone they knew was a free trader. The same was true in Britain with
regards to EU membership. Open borders and free trade are obviously all
good with no bad, according to the beautiful people. In both cases, the
Dirt People had other ideas and rallied to the banner of patriotic trade
and nationalism.

The reason for this is so-called free trade erodes public trust. People
assume politicians are crooked and dishonest. Even so, they expect their
government to put their interests, the nation’s interests, ahead of the
interests of foreigners. They may be crooks, but they are *our* crooks.
Free trade and open borders break that contract as the state ends up
siding with strangers over the citizens. The citizens soon begin to
question the value of citizenship and their support for the state. The
consequences are inevitable.

A good rule of life is that anytime a well understood word suddenly gets
a modifier, you know a caper is afoot. Trade is something people always
understood. One group of people trades their excess for the excess of
another group of people. Mexico sends Canada sombreros, while the
Canadians send Mexico beaver hats. Free-trade is something else
entirely. It is a collection of loopholes, so well-connected industries
can get all the benefits of the state, but shift the costs onto others.
Those cost are often quite high.

Trade between nations is a good thing. America selling pop culture to
China makes it tough for China to be bellicose and belligerent. China
selling cheap manufactured good to America prevents domestic firms from
becoming lazy and stupid. American cars are vastly better due to
competition with Japan. China scrupulously looks out for her interests
and America should do the same. If that means the snowflakes on campus
have to pay a little more for their iPhone, so be it. In the long run,
it is a bargain for them and their countrymen.
