For a long time, it was understood that the success of a people was tied
to the quality of the people in terms of their abilities. A highly
capable people would do better at the necessary things of society than
an incompetent people. Often, moral claims would cloud the view. Maybe
one people were chosen by God to rule over the others or maybe the
people offended the gods and had been punished as a result. Even so,
there has always been a link between talent and results.

Today we understand that Mother Nature does not distribute her gifts
equally between peoples or among people. Some people are smarter than
others. Some people have cultural qualities that seem to be rooted in
their shared genetics. These cultural qualities provide a benefit when
it comes to the tasks of society. A people who values hard work and
honest dealings will do better than a people who favor sloth or lying.
Whether these cultural qualities can be inculcated is debatable.

The blank slate crowd are sure that everything about a human society is
a construction of the mind and can therefore be deconstructed. Western
society, which has towered over the rest of mankind for more than five
hundred years, can be disassembled and then reassembled to put
non-Western people in charge. There is no evidence to support the claim,
but a great global experiment is underway, nonetheless. There is mass
migration from the Global South into the West.

A dozen years ago, Jason Richwine did his <a
href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/140239668/IQ-and-Immigration-Policy-Jason-Richwine"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">doctoral thesis</a> in the topic and
found that migration into the United States from the south was
decreasing the quality of human capital by reducing the over all IQ of
the population. He relied upon the mountain of IQ studies that show the
average intelligence of Hispanics to be ten points below the average for
Europeans. The usual suspects flew into a rage and had Jason Richwine
condemned for heresy.

No one bothered to challenge the conclusions of his study, as that would
suggest moral claims can be subject to objective measures. A key
component of any religion is that the moral claims are unassailable. The
new religion of Diversity, Inclusion and Equity operates like every
other religion. Its principles are beyond question. In this case, it
means that all people are equally capable and the differences seen
between people are due to the racism of white people.

You see this in a
[response](https://reason.com/2013/05/17/are-hispanics-too-stupid-to-become-ameri/)
by a writer at Reason Magazine. Ronald Bailey makes no effort to dispute
the factual claims of Richwine, as he lacks the intellectual capacity to
understand them, much less dispute them. Instead, he draws a parallel
between Richwine and eugenicists from a century ago. You see, “eugenics”
is a bad word so laying it in the same area as a person makes that
person bad. You can then safely dismiss the words of the bad people
without addressing them.

Even if you accept the claims in that Reason post, the flow of people
from the south into America is having a clear impact on IQ. The claim is
that the people coming in will get smarter by standing on the better
dirt in the United States, but it will take four or five generations for
that to happen. That is roughly a century. While that is happening, the
population of low IQ people rises. This is happening rather quickly due
to the age distribution of the white population.

For example, using government data, whites have an average IQ of 100,
blacks are at 85 and the new people are around 90. This is consistent
with what Richwine found in his research and what subsequent research
has shown. This is one of those times when the official government
position mirrors reality. That means that the average IQ in the United
States in 1950 was around 98. By 1980, with the uptick in immigration
and decline in white fertility, the average was just over 97.

In other words, with very stable demographics and little immigration,
the average IQ in the United States had not changed very much in thirty
years. This would explain why the country was able to pull out of the
cultural lunacy of the prior decades and turn things around so quickly.
There were a lot of smart people. Societies with high average
intelligence also have a much larger number of smart people. These are
the people who solve the problems made by other smart people.

By 2000, the effects of immigration were showing up in the test scores.
The average IQ of the country, based on the new demographic mix, was
below 97. By 2020 the average had fallen to below 96. In another decade
it will fall below 95 and when the white population is a minority, it
will be around 93. Note also that the aging off of the white population
lowers white IQ. Not only are white people getting dumber, but old
people are dumber than their younger selves.

Imagine a wardrobe made for a man who is 6’5″ and athletic being handed
down to a man who is 5’10’ and a lazy person. The latter can pretend he
does not like the style, but the reality is the clothes simply do not
fit. This is what is happening in America as the people are replaced
with new people. The old cultural, political and economic institutions
were made for a people with an IQ close to 100. The new people will
struggle to operate what they have inherited.

The flat earth people argue that culture is meaningless and the new
people will be able to run the country as they like with the same
economic results. The only thing that will change is the complexion.
Instead of white guys staring at their mobile devices as they walk into
traffic, it will be trans-lesbians of color. In fact, the final end of
whiteness will unleash the creative energy of the nonwhite people. The
result will be the paradise the prophets have long promised.

The trouble is the facts suggest otherwise. Twenty years ago, Richard
Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen made the connection between intelligence and
economics. In *IQ and the Wealth of Nations* they showed that average
national intelligence corresponds with the over all wealth of society.
The usual suspects condemned the book and the authors, while accepting
their conclusions. There is a reason the best universities do not draw
names from a hat for admissions.

Recently, researchers George Francis and Emil O.W. Kirkegaard have
revisited the topic and came to the same <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363583751_National_Intelligence_and_Economic_Growth_A_Bayesian_Update"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">conclusion</a>, which is to say there is
a strong correlation between national wealth and national IQ. Francis <a
href="https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/national-iq-is-the-best-predictor?sd=pf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a> that national IQ correlates not
only with economic prosperity, but every national indicator of success.
That means things like crime, social trust, affordable family formation
and all of the other things we associated with stable, happy societies.

Of course, there is the
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">smart fraction</a> issue. As civilization becomes more
complex, the demand for cognitive ability increases. At the top, where
the most complex decisions are made, the demands go up much faster. The
more complex a society, the more above average people are required to
manage it. A society where everyone is the same IQ of 100, will not
perform as well as a society where the average is 100 and intelligence
is normally distributed.

The trending down of national IQ means the relative number of people in
the smart fraction initially declines, but the overall smart fraction
grows. In time, however, this reverses and the smart fraction begins to
decline quickly in total and in relation to the size of the population.
There are not enough smart people around to keep the system running, so
the system must become less complex. Put another way, it must
disaggregate, either slowly or all of a sudden.

What this means in terms of public policy is debatable. The most likely
answer is that debating it is a waste of time. There is no arresting the
demographic changes and there is no changing what that means as far as
human capital. Even if there is a way to make it work, there are not
enough smart people around willing to do it. At some point North America
passes through the
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51233/51233-h/51233-h.htm"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">marching moron</a> phase into something
else. That something else will poor, nasty, brutish, and short lived.
