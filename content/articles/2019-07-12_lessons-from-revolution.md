Over the long Independence Day weekend, I was thinking about how events
unfolded in the colonies during the revolutionary period. The story of
American independence is a lot like most revolutionary events. Any
number of decisions by the participants could have radically altered the
outcome. Just as in France or Russia, the king had a lot of chances to
resolve the situation in his own favor, but either failed to act or made
the one decision that was the worst among all possible options.

One thing led to another and I got the idea of a show where I take a
quick look at other tumultuous times to see what lessons we can pluck
from that could be relevant to our own age. I don’t want to make this
into a history podcast, but our side has a high level of historical
literacy, so history talk is a good framing devise. That and variety
keeps a podcast interesting. Me reading clips from the news every week
would get dull for all of us in a hurry, so trying to things keeps it
fresh.

The thing that always jumps out to me when reading about tumultuous
times is the mistakes the made by the people in charge are so similar.
The Tsar, for example, was an educated man, He had to see the parallels
between his situation and that of King Louis, but he acted as if he were
working from a script. Just think of how different things would have
been if he simply fled the country as soon as it was clear he was losing
support from the military. Instead, he played his role as written.

Of course, one of the benefits of thinking about the parallels between
this age and prior ages, is we can apply how we see ourselves today to
that time in the past. That provides some insight into what it must have
been like to the people living through those interesting times. Think
about how you felt after Trump won in 2016 or Brexit passed in Britain
and then imagine people feeling the same way about some moment in the
French Revolution or during the American Revolution.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
