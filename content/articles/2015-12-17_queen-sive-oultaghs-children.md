If you pay any attention to American politics and you can look past the
shouting and hand waving, you’ll notice that both parties are strikingly
similar. In the House, the leader of the Democrats is an old woman from
the most left-wing congressional district in the country. The
Republicans are led by a strange little man from one the most liberal
states in the country. Wisconsin is the ancestral home of the
Progressive Movement.

As I pointed in my award winning post on
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=5862" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the voting nations and America</a>, the Republican Party
is a southern party with northern leaders. Those northern leaders are
thoroughly disconnected from their voters, but thoroughly connected to
their analogs in the other party. America has been run by a Yankee
coalition since the Civil War and we are now in the midst of a
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=5360" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Yankee Crackup</a>.

The ructions in the primaries are entirely due to the yawning chasm
between the people and their rulers. Donald Trump is leading in the
polls because he is a rebuke to the party leadership. A long time ago I
compared him to Beppe Grillo, who was similarly dismissed as a clown and
a publicity stunt until his party started winning elections. Even now,
the European political elite dismisses these populist movements.

Dismiss is not really correct, though, is it? In Europe, Merkel is
making war on the native population by actively encouraging a Muslim
invasion. Whole German towns have been turned into Arab ghettos
overnight. The reason seems to be nothing more than spite. The evidence
is as clear as day that the people do not want this, so what other
reason is there for pushing a policy that the people despise?

Now we are seeing something similar happening in the US. The budget
pushed through by Paul Ryan is not just bad politics. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">It is a contradiction of everything he
promised</a> just a month ago when he got the job. It’s as if he
deliberately assembled a bill that contradicted everything he promised
just to stick a finger in the eye of his own voters. The reason to think
the point of this point is to spite his voters is the <a
href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/263529-funding-deal-hits-backlash-over-increase-in-worker-visas"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">immigration stuff</a>. How else can you
interpret such an outrageous betrayal?

Anyway, this latest insult to the people by their “representatives” got
me thinking about the Irish Potato Famine. In America this event has
largely been flushed down the memory hole because the Irish-Americans
find it embarrassing. An estimated one million Irish died from famine
within half a decade. Millions more simply fled the country for the rest
of the English speaking world. Ireland lost 25% of its population in
five years.

Historians blame the famine on a number of factors, but it was the
political arrangements that set everything in motion. Oppression of
Catholics by the English resulted in a system where the farm land was
owned not by Irish, but by English landlords who lived in England. These
absentee landlords relied on middlemen to collect rents and enforce
their rights against an indigenous population that was trapped in a
feudal system.

We live in a different age, but we are facing something similar in
America where the financial elite are entirely divorced from the rest of
America. They flit around between financial and political capitals
without much contact with the people. They are the new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">ascendancy class</a> and their middlemen
are the political parties, who enforce the rules and guard their
interests.

The Irish Famine was directly the result of a potato blight, but what
should have been a minor disruption in farming was turned into a
disaster by a break in the normal feedback loop in a society. The ruling
class were slow to react and indifferent to the initial suffering,
because the Irish were not their people. They may as well have been
Bantus living in an African jungle. Politics then, as now, was local and
all the politicians were across the sea, instead of talking to their
people.

America is not going to be struck by a potato famine, obviously, but we
are being hit with an immigration disaster and a looming financial
disaster. The ruling elite is plundering the country and indifferent to
the people. Instead, they rely on politicians like Paul Ryan to enforce
their orders and collect their rents. The rents in this case are
indentured servants brought in to displace native workers. Instead of
being throw off the land, Americans are being thrown out of their jobs.

Historical analogies are never perfect. There’s no sign of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbonism" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Ribbonism</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteboys" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Whiteboyism</a> breaking out in America, but who knows
what tomorrow will bring. In some respects, the websites and podcasts of
the dissident right are filling the role of those Irish secret
societies. Our rulers and their middlemen are hardly aware that we
exist. What they do know about us tells them we are trouble and must be
suppressed.
