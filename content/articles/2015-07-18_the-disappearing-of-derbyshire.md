I’m a fan of John Derbyshire and listen to his podcast each week. I did
not subscribe for the pay version at Taki because I could not get their
pay service to work. My first rule of commerce is that if you make it
hard for me to do business with you, I will not do business with you.
The Taki pay model, at least from my experience, was designed to chase
away customers.

But, John would post his transcripts and audio later in the week on his
site so I could listen to it there. Now I see that
<a href="http://takimag.com/article/adios_radio_derb#axzz3gG3ThM9H"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki has this up</a> claiming that Derb
has gone dark. They have scrubbed their site of his content so it is
reasonable to assume there has been a falling out between Derb and Taki.
<a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">On John’s site</a> he says he shall return in two weeks.

I have no idea how popular Radio Derb is as a podcast. I enjoy it a
great deal. John has a great voice and a good eye for content that will
play well as audio. I listen to a lot of podcasts and I count his as one
of the better ones. But, I’m a fringe guy and my tastes are surely not
mainstream. Still, Derb has to be one of the more popular contributors
at Taki.

John is a good example of just how far left the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Overton Window</a> has moved in my lifetime. Not so long
ago John would have been a typical conservative commenter. When he began
writing for National Review, he was rather conventional in his opinions,
but much more empirical in his presentation. Today he is considered a
fringe weirdo, a man wearing a tinfoil cap. That’s what happens when the
inmates take over the asylum.

Let us hope he has not permanently disappeared.
