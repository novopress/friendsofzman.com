**Note:** You may have observed some site outages over the last week or
so and rest assured we have top men on the case. It seems that traffic
volumes have reached a critical point, so some upgrades are in order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last week, in his <a
href="https://vdare.com/radio-derb/prosecuting-officer-chauvin-helicopter-money-javanka-canceled-and-andy-ngo-s-book-etc"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">weekly broadcast</a>, the great John
Derbyshire mentioned some of the looming threats to our peace and
prosperity. I have been thinking about some of the same things and
decided this week to take a swing at the topic as well. At the start of
every year, I sit down and write out some goals and evaluate my
finances, in order to have some structure for my activities. Like
everyone, my plans are ambitious, but each new year brings hope, despite
by dwindling years.

As a result, I am in the frame of mind to think about the monsters that
may be lying in wait or the trillion-dollar bills that may lying on the
ground, waiting for someone to come along and pick it up. With all the
hubbub about the election and the response to it by our increasingly
reactionary rulers, it is hard to think much about anything else. Still,
you have to look ahead and what I see is not a pretty picture. This
coming year could very well make 2020 look like the good old days.

To be perfectly honest, I am not sure it is such a bad thing that the
collection of time-serving hacks and criminals that is the Biden
administration will be charged with managing our way through the
minefield of 2021. Much of what lies ahead is the creation of the ruling
class. Maybe they can more easily undo what they have wrought than a
Trump team facing constant opposition.  At the minimum, The Pretender
can call off the BLM and Antifa mobs that have been running wild.

If they are unable to navigate their way through the minefield they
created, then it clarifies things for us. The thing none of them seem to
grasp at the moment is they own it all now. Prior to Trump they could
play the good cop – worse cop routine with the GOP presenting themselves
to us as the least bad option. The Democrats, of course, did the same to
their coalition. Right now, that option is not available to them, as
both parties have stopped pretending to be opponents.

Of course, when looking ahead you cannot see around corners or see the
knock-on effects that will come from whatever they do to fix what they
broke. Wise heads have been pointing out for a year, for example, that
the economy is a very complicated system that no one really understands
in full, much less detail. Smashing it with the Covid hammer will create
lots of unknown unknowns. The same is true for immigration and trade,
which they will smash this coming year.

If you read the writing of the new managerial regime, they like to talk
about disrupting things and overturning stuff. They seem to have an
unthinking belief that salvation can only come through chaos. One way of
achieving this is the subversion of truth and order, so that perspective
is all that matters. We are probably going to see what that looks like
when applied to a society through public policy. We may be about to
experience the first instance of recursive subversion.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

**Promotions:** The good folks at

target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
