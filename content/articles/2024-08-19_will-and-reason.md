revolution and its discontents, a post about the drama within the

Many of the leading figures of what came to be known as the Human
BioDiversity (HBD) movement are reaching the age where they are no
longer producing new work, but instead are part of retrospectives of the
movement they created. This <a
href="https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-long-dissent-charles-murray-and"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in Aporia by Bo Winegard is a
good example. It works as both a summary of Murray’s work and a summary
of the hereditarian perspective on the human animal. “Hereditarian” is
another word used for the biological realist wing of the human sciences.

It is not entirely accurate to call these people a movement as they have
had no impact on how Western societies view human organization. If
anything, the West has raced in the opposite direction of what should
follow from the realities that have come from the human sciences. Since
*The Bell Curve* was published thirty years ago, the blank slate,
fanatical egalitarianism and universalism have become so entrenched in
elite thinking that dissent is now criminal in many countries.

That is what you are seeing in the UK. The people being sent off to
prison for voicing complaints about immigration are not being punished
for opposing public policy, but for violating official orthodoxy with
regards to the human condition. Across the West, any noticing of
difference between groups of humans is blasphemy. Not only would *The
Bell Curve* not get a publisher today, but it is also something of a
miracle that it has not been put on the index of banned books, next to
*The Camp of the Saints*.

Therein lies the most important lesson to come from the HBD scene. Facts
and reason can never overcome belief. There is no questioning the
science with regards to the human condition. It has confirmed thousands
of years of observation that nature does not distribute her gifts
equally. That is true with regards to individuals and with regards to
groups of individuals. The reason you never take the MLK exist is not
because you are immoral, but because you are rational.

Rationality is no match for belief, at least when it comes to politics.
The promise of a guilt free future has won every battle regarding
biology. Of course, it is the echo of Calvin that embedded racial guilt
into the Western mind. Facts and reason had no impact on belief before,
during or after the Civil War, because the fanatics behind the
abolitionist cause were immune to facts and reason. Like all fanatics,
they saw only that which confirmed their fanaticism.

The point here is that the defeat of human biodiversity,
hereditarianism, biological realism, or whatever term you have for the
facts of the human condition, was simply another battle in the long war
between belief and reason. One side, the winning side, believes the
human condition can be solved because they believe the cause of human
conflict lies in the human mind and can therefore be eradicated. The
other side has never had an answer to that claim.

Another lesson from the twilight of the human sciences is that knowledge
for the sake of knowledge is a dead end. What matters in the affairs of
man, therefore what matters with regards the human condition, is
knowledge that leads men to act either on behalf of that knowledge or in
opposition to it. Anything else is at best useless and at worst a reason
for opponents to act on the claim that this new knowledge is a threat to
the wellbeing of society.

In one of life’s great ironies, the HBD people never understood how
their work could be seen as dangerously heretical. For all their
knowledge about the mechanics of mankind, they have never understood the
*will* that lies behind human action, preferring to believe what lies
behind the motivations of their accusers is just as mechanical and
sterile as their own understanding of man. Materialism is a terrible way
to understand the *why* of the human condition.

More important, the HBD people could never shake their civic nationalist
priors or even question them in light of their own work. *The Bell
Curve* is the argument against liberal democracy, an argument understood
long before the HBD people arrived. Despite the obvious conflict between
what the science was telling us and what political science was demanding
of us, the HBD people never lost faith in liberalism. They remain
convinced it is the only political option.

It is not all bad for the HBD scene. It has, at least for a while,
provided a moral authority of sorts for resisting the gathering
darkness. There remains an “E pur si muove” mental space for dissidents
to gather their thoughts about what is happening. Inside the mental
space lies the flicker of hope that reality cannot be swamped by the
fantastical reality of the prevailing orthodoxy. The foundation of the
dissident cause are the people who accept the reality of the human
condition.

In the end, however, it will not be men armed with charts and graphs who
shall beat back the forces of darkness but the men who know that society
is determined by those who understand it is always who shall overcome
whom. If the West is to survive, it will be due to those who will it so
and use any means necessary to prevail over those determined to turn out
the lights on civilization. The only justification needed will simply be
the desire to make it so.
