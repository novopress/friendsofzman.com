One of the underappreciated aspects of liberal democracy is that it
always pits morality versus objective facts, always creating a false
choice. Every public debate is between one camp that demand we do “the
right thing” and another camp that insist on doing “the correct thing”.
The right thing is defined as the moral thing while the correct thing is
the factually accurate or effective thing. The choice is failure while
on the moral high ground or succeed and be seen and inhumane or
indifferent.

This false choice predates the rise and spread of liberal democracy, so
it is not accurate to lay the blame there. The debate that evolved over
economics that grew up out of the industrial revolution is the origin.
The Marxists were never making an economic argument back in the 19th
century. They started with a moral claim that capitalism is built on
exploitation of the workers. This was inherently immoral so it must lead
to class struggle, crisis and then revolution.

This lack of an economic plan of any sort should have been obvious, but
the followers and Marx were not interested in practical matters. The
appeal was always the morality of the program. It was the chief selling
point. This was made manifest in Russia when the Bolsheviks seized
control of the state. Suddenly they were faced with solving the sorts of
problem governments are tasked with doing. They had no economic platform
from which to work, just gobs of Marxist theory.

The reaction to Marxism was Austrian School economics. Unlike the
Marxists, the Austrians had a very detailed analysis of economics. Their
model explained the basics of how goods and services flowed through an
economy. This factual accuracy made it possible to form public policy
and test the result. Over the course of the Cold War, Austrian economics
became the primary weapon against Marxism. It stripped communist
economics of the claim to empirical authority.

The trouble with Austrian School economics is it also striped morality
and group preference from public debate. Every want and desire had to be
justified by an economic argument. Rotten results that may make sense
according to the laws of economic could not be contested. The out of
control consumerism we see, for example, just has to be tolerated. The
spread of degeneracy cannot be opposed, because the market dictates what
is right in society.

American society has been squeezed in this vice for a long time. One
side makes arguments that make some sense from a moral perspective but
are completely unworkable as a practical matter. The other side counters
with what appear to be factually correct arguments, the results of which
are unsustainable. Worse still, neither side has a way to counter the
other. The result of this dynamic is a system that is morally
indefensible but shaking to pieces by moral fervor.

Ironically, both jaws of this vice are built on false assumptions. The
Marxists fall victim to Hume’s guillotine. The value of a good or
service is no doubt the sum of the labor it requires to produce it. It
does not follow that anyone in society or society as a whole should
agree. The other jaw makes a different error, assuming that human beings
act from economic self-interest. They can, but they more often act from
biological reasons, especially group biological reasons.

The dynamic resulting from this false choice seems to be reaching an end
point, where neither side is sustainable. The moral claims made by what
is called the Left have veered so far into the ridiculous that it looks
like satire. A century ago, it was easy to sympathize with the groups
the Left claimed to champion. Workers being ripped off by unscrupulous
employers had a strong claim. Men is bizarre outfits claiming to be a
third sex are clowns no one can take seriously.

A similar fate has befallen the so-called Right. When massive global
corporations are stripping people of their lights, often by funding
street gangs to assaults people going about their business, it is
laughable to defend the “free market” system that produced these
companies. When state sponsored financial concerns are buying up houses
to create new renters, in the name of capitalism, the so-called free
market is just as ridiculous as the men in dresses.

Liberal democracy has become an octopus with its tentacles wrapped
around various parts of society. One tentacle is the moralizers
assaulting us with the latest fads from corporate HR. Another tentacle
is consumerism strip mining the traditions and history, the social
capital, that are the foundation stones of society. Another tentacle is
finance capital skimming a bit from every transaction without adding
anything back. Every tentacle has a corresponding one to help it fight
off attacks.

That is the primary defense of the system. All critics are herded into
this set of false choices the system maintains. If you do not like that
state-sponsored hedge funds are hoovering up single family homes, you
have two choices. One is you can throw in with the loons and their
bizarre defense of bourgeoise decadence. The other is you can waste your
time making an economic argument claiming that the “market” will solve
the problem if we worship it more.

The point of democratic systems is for the public to have a say in how
public policy is formulated and a veto over the final result. In
reality, it offers false choices controlled by a narrow elite. The
narrow elite hides in the shadows of a mythical beast called the general
will or the invisible hand of the market. It is a curtain behind which
stands the ruling class. In the end, it is looking like what Marxism and
liberal democracy have always claimed to oppose.
