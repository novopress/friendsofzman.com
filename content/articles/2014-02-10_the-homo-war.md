[Looks like everyone over at the NY
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/sports/michael-sam-college-football-star-says-he-is-gay-ahead-of-nfl-draft.html?_r=0)
is ready to celebrate the first openly homosexual football player. The
Left has been using homosexuals as a proxy in their war in white men for
a couple of decades now. Football, which is popular with white men, is
hated by the Left. That’s why they are peddling the concussion stuff.
Now that can make it gay. The NFL will no doubt have Pride Day and maybe
make the players wear rainbow outfits.

The weird thing about the homosexual stuff is it borders on
self-mockery. Much of what constitutes the gay lifestyle and the gay
aesthetic is self-denigrating. Homosexuals are full of self-loathing due
to their affliction, so their public expression is often a mockery of
the gay lifestyle. Liberace is a good example. Elton John is another.
There’s nothing about the gay stuff that is ennobling or respectable. At
bets it is campy and silly. At worse it is degenerate.

There was never a time when homosexuals were discriminated against on
the scale of blacks, Jews, Irish, Italians and Catholics. There are some
make believe times, like the [Stonewall
Riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots), but they are
mostly imaginary. Stonewall was not a riot in any sense of the word. It
was a protest, for sure, that put attention on the cop’s habit of
raiding Mafia owned gay clubs. The fact that the Mafia was exploiting
homosexual males and the cops were primarily targeting the mob gets lost
in the phony narrative.

The point being, harassment of homosexuals has never been much of an
issue in America. A black guy in 1990 probably faced more hostility than
the typical gay guy in the worst of times. We’re talking about rude
jokes, not anything that would alter one’s life. The gay lifestyle
killed more gay men in a weekend than straights have in a century. Most
people get this, so casting gays as sympathetic victims is a loser’s
gambit.

As with all cults and subcultures, defining who is in and who is out of
the group is the primary focus of the group. For the Left, being a
member of the anointed mean embracing the homosexual stuff. It’s not
about the homosexuals themselves. The Left does not care about them any
more than they care about blacks. Homosexuals are just another charm of
the progressive charm bracelet, to be shown off at the next cocktail
party. The gay man is just another totem.
