A few months ago, when Pedro Gonzalez suddenly became an over-the-top
supporter of Ron DeSantis and committed enemy of all Trump supporters on
Twitter, I knew I was going to hate the 2024 election. The election was
never going to be fun with Trump running, as it would mean another round
of foaming at the mouth claims about Trump, but with DeSantis in the
race it would be much worse.

The reason it would be worse is lots of people who should know better
would convince themselves that DeSantis was the miracle antidote to
their troubles. They would make all of the arguments that the anti-Trump
people make, but swear they are acting from better motives or making a
reasoned critique. Many of the on-line influencers, of course, would be
on the payroll of DeSantis.

On the other side would be the vast on-line army of Trump fans, many of
whom are on the Trump payroll. They would dust off their playbooks from
2016 when they went to war with the neocons and Buckley-cons, but this
time they would not be using jokes and clever memes, but shrill denials
and denunciations. In other words, they will just be monkeys fleeing poo
at the crap-fest.

This election will be a test of sorts for our people. Many on this side
of the great divide still cling to the fantasy of voting our way out of
this mess. Their heads tell them it is not possible, but a lifetime of
conditioning still traps holds their hearts. Their struggle will be
avoiding the crap show, but many will succumb and join it. Those who
have broken free from the madness will not enjoy seeing this.

That is the point of the show this week. There are hard truths about
this age and our politics that are the final boss on the trip over to
this sort of politics. Once these truths are accepted, the coming
election is just a reboot of a bad movie. It is Fast & Furious Nth
edition, this time with new bad actors to join the bad actors from
previous iterations of the franchise. Enjoy the fake explosions.
