Note: The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-all-powerful-leviathan/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. The subject of it
and today’s post is the new way to look at the system ruling over us. Of
course,
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/541288" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday Thoughts</a> is up behind the green door for
those needing audio stimulation. Much of it is about the situation in
Europe and the evolving Canadian dictatorship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the problems with the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=561" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Opposite Rule of Liberalism</a> is that it relies on the
old Left-Right dichotomy of American politics. This framing persists
despite the fact that it is a vestige of a bygone era that no longer
works today. The political divide is now between those who adhere to the
basket of ideas called Western liberalism and those who defend the
post-Marxist managerial state. The latter group is made up almost
entirely of members of the ruling class.

In other words, we now live in a world divided by those in the system of
control that hovers over the West and those who live under it. The Dirt
People versus Cloud People framing is a much more honest, if a bit
sarcastic, framework for the world. The ruling system is like a miasma
that hangs over society, infecting the minds of the people and their
relations with one another. We can see the elites at the top, just
barely, but the system they control is all around us.

A big part of what ails society is this sense that things are not as
they seem, but it is hard to get a read on why. That noxious miasma that
lingers in every aspect of society often leads people to doubt their own
senses. Their experience tells them things about the world and people in
it, but everywhere they look they are getting messages telling them that
what they think they see is not true. Instead, they are to believe
something that is often the opposite of what they experience.

This is where the Opposite Rule continues to work. Those who are aware
of the contradictions of daily existence can apply the rule to the
information stream that comes from the system, filling the area around
them. Whatever is in the air at the moment, start from some version of
the opposite, and the truth will be near. The Opposite Rule of
Liberalism is best restated as the Opposite Rule of Managerialism. This
organic, self-aware system that rules over us is the opposite of truth.

A useful example comes from the daily barrage of “information” from the
system about the crisis in Ukraine. Here is a
[story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/business/russia-has-been-laying-groundwork-online-for-a-false-flag-operation-misinformation-researchers-say.html)
from the New York Times headlined, “Russia has been laying groundwork
online for a ‘false flag’ operation, misinformation researchers say.”
Note that this story is not behind the usual paywall, as they want wide
circulation of it. Note also that the writer is one of the infants they
employ to copy and paste material into “news reports.”

This news report starts with a news report from a European based group
called European Expert Association, which is described as “a research
group that focuses on security in Ukraine.” When you take a look at who
<a href="https://uaeuxperts.org/en/board/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">these people</a> are, it becomes obvious that they are
Ukrainian activists. These are not neutral observers searching for the
truth about the crisis. More important, when you look at their resumes
you see all the familiar NGO’s that are pushing for war with Russia.

Of course, this is the New York Times, the first draft of history and
the leader in the American news media. They do not just take this at
face value. They hand it to a group called the Global Disinformation
Index, a nonprofit “research” group. These are the go-to guys for the
Times reports on misinformation and disinformation. To the shock of no
one in the Times offices, the researchers at
<a href="https://disinformationindex.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Global Disinformation Index</a> confirmed everything
said the European Expert Association.

The reason the Times was not surprised by what they heard back from the
Global Disinformation Index is the person running it is Anne Applebaum.
She is a notorious warmonger and neoconservative. <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/liberal-democracy-worth-fight/619833/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> she is advocating for the
liquidation of the Afghanis and the Syrians as a “solution” to those
problems. Applebaum is a big believer in what Stalin supposedly said
about people causing problems for the regime. No man, no problem.
Applebaum just scales it up.

Her partner in this enterprise is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pomerantsev" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Ukrainian activist</a> named Peter Pomerantsev, who is
probably on the payroll of a Western intelligence service. His biography
does not pass the laugh test. His role in life has been to seed Western
media with anti-Russian information dressed up as Ukrainian nationalism.
The rest of the staff of the Global Disinformation Index all have an axe
to grind with some enemy of the neocons, past, present or in the future.

The point of this walk through the swamps behind the ministry of
disinformation is to illustrate how the new rule works. If a media
outlet is claiming to root out disinformation, you can be sure they are
not doing that. Instead, start with the assumption that they are waging
a disinformation campaign. That is what you see in the New York Times
story and any story containing the words “Global Disinformation Index.”
Then you can begin to figure out what is really going on with the story.

Of course, the entirely new obsession with misinformation and
disinformation by government and mass media is a big lie. Since forever,
people have known that governments lie all the time. They have known
that the media is partisan, a form of activism more often than not. Yet
suddenly we are being told that the media and the government are now
declaring war in false information. Since they are the only possible
source of disinformation, this means war on themselves.

The big lie, for those unfamiliar, is a lie so colossal that no one
would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth
so infamously. This is now the default tactic of the managerial state.
They tell us that Eskimo truckers protesting vaccine rules are white
supremacists. Then they bring in a “hate expert” to claim that
<a href="https://archive.ph/Zozut" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">freedom is a form of violence</a>. These outlandish
whoppers are then signed off on by new experts who sagely tell us the
moon is made of cheese.

Unlike normal propaganda techniques, this new tactic is not to further a
cause, although it can be used that way as we see with Ukraine. The
neocons are simply taking advantage of a defense mechanism that has
evolved since the Cold War. By flooding the zone with outlandish
nonsense, the system prevents cogent analysis of what it is doing or
contradicting it in any way. It is a form of menticide to paralyze the
people by suspending them in a solution of false narratives.

This is the utility of the Opposite Rule. It helps clarify the new
relationship between the leviathan and the people. Instead of viewing
society as a hierarchical structure that is responsive to the will of
the people, you see that it is an adversarial relationship between a
ruling organism and the people. This ruling organism is the vast
administrative state made up of government, corporations, the academy,
non-profits and the mass media. It is a fully integrated organism.

The endless waves of information, mostly false information, is its
primary defense mechanism against what it sees as a threat. That threat
is the people over whom it hovers like a noxious cloud. The point of the
false information is to keep the people in a fog of confusion about who
really rules over them. You cannot rebel against that which you are not
even sure exists. Menticide is the primary defense mechanism of this
system of social control we call managerialism.
