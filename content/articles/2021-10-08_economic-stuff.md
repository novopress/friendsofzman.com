If you look back to the early days of this site, a lot of what I posted
was about economics or government economic policy. These days, it is
rare that the topic comes up unless it is in references to communism. In
fact, economics is no longer a big topic of discussion anywhere, even
with the silly libertarians. It comes up, of course, but it is no longer
the big issue. Up until recent, economics was the centerpiece of
conservatism and their brief against their alleged opponents.

Thirty years ago, the big change in politics was Bill Clinton using the
catchphrase, “It’s the economy stupid” to attack George Bush. From then
on, official politics was about taxes and fiscal policy. It was all a
show, of course, but it framed the political debate and turned
economists into TV stars. The site Marginal Revolution was a big deal
for a while because Tyler Cowen was a star economist. Today the site is
covered in tumbleweeds because no one cares about libertarian economics
anymore.

Even now with the economy having problems at the retail end, people are
more focused on the less tangible stuff like CRT or Covid policy. The
massive Build Back Better bill stuck in Congress gets little attention.
Regime media talks about it as a magic elixir so the crazies have
something to chant, but otherwise they have left it alone. Twenty years
ago, Conservative Inc would have been organizing a campaign against it,
but today they cannot generate much interest in the thing.

One reason for this is that people have come to realize that caring
about the economy, tax policy or government programs changes nothing.
Those who vote Republican have come to terms with the fact that none of
the things they want in terms of taxes and spending will ever happen, so
they have lost interest. The far-left still dreams of the socialist
paradise, but it is mostly a show of piety. Medicare-for-all may as well
be unicorns-for-all and they probably know it.

It used to be an axiom of politics that a good economy was good for
incumbents, but the strong economy was of no use to Trump in 2020. He
tried to talk about the stock market and jobs for black people, but no
one cared about those things. What mattered was his personality and how
the righteous felt about it. With Biden, the issue is his growing
dementia and the weirdness of this administration. They built a fake
Oval Office for him to do live shots for some reason. Why do that?

The lesson here is that if caring about something makes no difference,
people will eventually stop caring about it. Caring about immigration,
for example, does nothing to change policy, so eventually people will
stop caring about it too. You can run through all the issues this way
and before long you get to the point where caring who wins the next
election no longer matters. That’s why politics is getting so personals.
It is the only thing people can care about, so they care about
personalities.

Even so, economics still matters. If the economy turns sour, people will
care about economics, if only in a general sense. The Cloud People have
big plans for the post-human economic order, so it is worth discussing.
This week, the show is about some of the issues that come up in
dissident circles related to economics. A little change of pace from the
normal ranting and raving about the culture. A call back to the days of
green eyeshade conservatism.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
