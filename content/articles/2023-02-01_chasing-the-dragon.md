Recently, whoever owns the Dodge car brand announced that the brand
would stop making sports cars in the near future. They will discontinue
their line of muscle cars in favor of electric cars. Many other car
makers have promised that they will soon cease making cars with internal
combustion engines. Reminiscent of the Soviet five year plans, they are
promising to be right with Gaia in five years. Like those five year
plans this is unlikely to happen, barring societal collapse.

The main reason this will never happen is that electric cars are and
always have been a stupid lie against practical reality. The stupidity
lies in the fact that at the end of every green scheme lies a
smokestack. There is no such thing as renewable energy so that leaves
the only way we know to get usable energy, breaking atoms. The lie is
that these new cars are better in some way. They are not. In fact,
electric cars are inferior at all of the things that make normal cars
useful.

This short
[post](https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2023/01/27/first-they-lied-about-the-range/)
summarizes the more obvious problems with eclectic vehicles, but you
could write a book on the topic. The cost of ownership is significantly
higher to the user and even higher for society, if one thinks mountains
of old batteries is a problem that society should mitigate against. Then
there is the fact that they will forever be impractical for most people.
The biggest problem is they will require trillions in infrastructure
changes that will never happen.

Like the eBook, the electric car is a solution in search of a problem.
In fact, the eBook is the place to start in order to grasp the lunacy of
the EV. Deliberately swept down the memory hole is the fact that the
same people who say the electric car is the future also said the eBook
was the future. The claim was the reduced cost of making an eBook versus
a real book would end printing entirely. The publishers would simply
abandon the practice of printing books.

There is the first comparison to ponder. Hidden in the selling of the
eBook idea was the claim that you would be forced to burn your paper
books in favor of Amazon deciding what you could read. It was a form of
the old communist line about capitalist selling the communists the rope
they would use to hang them. In this case, the greed of the publishers
would be used to enforce the eBook dream. Behind every radical project
are men holding pistols, waiting for their chance.

We see an advanced version at work with electric vehicles. First the
regime rolled out incentives for battery makers and car makers. Then
they rolled out incentives for people to buy these cars. There are
incentives for municipalities to install charging stations and find ways
to encourage EV use. Now we are into the stick phase where car makers
are getting bullied to stop making normal cars. The regime enjoys the
carrot and stick approach, but they most really enjoy the stick.

In both the eBook and the eVehicle, we saw form up what amounted to a
religious community in support of these novelties. When the eBook hit
the scene, the same people who swore Starbucks made great coffee
suddenly decided that they could only read off a device. It was the
future! The same people who swore eBooks were the future are now saying
the same thing with electric cars. They are the same people who swore
masks and standing on one foot would prevent Covid.

The electric car and the electric book are two examples of the other
side of the moral panic, which is the moral crusade. Both moral the
panic and the moral crusade arise from the same desire among the people
swept up in them. They are seeking both salvation and a sense of
security. On the one hand, they want to be secure from whatever it is
that is causing the panic, like climate change or Covid. On the other
hand, they want to be seen as a good person, one of the elect.

For a very long time, almost all of human history in fact, religion was
the vessel into which these aspects of belief were contained. Religion
told the faithful that as long as they were pious they were going to be
okay. Maybe that meant an afterlife or maybe it meant justice in this
life. If they followed the rules, they would be safe. It also promised a
little extra for those who were particularly pious. The public act of
piety has been with us since Gobekli Tepe for this reason.

It turns out that reason, appeals to nature and historical inevitability
are poor replacements for the supernatural. In the Christian era, the
faith supplied all of the spiritual security one needed, because it
truly sated the desire. It made clear what one could expect from
salvation. Ideology, on the other hand, ironically enough, is like an
opioid, in that it provides an initial euphoric satisfaction, but then
an insatiable craving for even more of what it promised.

It turns out that we are plagued by these moral crusades and panics
because the people behind them are like drug addicts. For them,
modernity is an opium den in which the are condemned to chase the dragon
for eternity. It is why during Covid so many of them had that same dead
expression in their eyes you see from addicts. With their mask firmly
on, they were in the only space where they were both free from the agony
of desire and the ecstasy of the narcotic high.

Now that the high priest of the electric vehicle has revealed himself to
be nothing more than an opportunist, the religion of the EV has been
shaken. The people who told us the electrical car was the vehicle to
spiritual satisfaction are now turning on the idea as a way to smite the
evil Elon Musk. Of course, practical reality will eventually reduce the
idea to a niche item, like the eBook. Somewhere, someone like Elon Musk
is thinking about the next moral crusade to monetize.
