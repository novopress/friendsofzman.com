This week the podcast goes international, as we do a whole show on those
strange foreign people called Europeans. I wanted to do something on
Italy and while scanning the wires for updates on their situation, I
found other stuff worth covering. Our mass media only reports on the
world when it is on fire, so it is good to look around at foreign and
alternative press to get a fuller understanding of the world. It also
made for a good theme to the podcast this week. I always like it when
there is a theme to the show.

One administrative note. Next week there will not be a podcast. I’m
traveling all next week and possibly into the following week. I have
done podcasts on the road, but it is a big hassle and I’m not going to
fight it. Blogging from the road is no big deal, but recording requires
a much higher level of effort. If you need your weekend fix, try out
FTN, which is doing a new feature where they cover a single topic in
detail. Last week they did a long analysis on <a
href="http://fashthenation.com/2018/05/fash-the-nation-123-the-yellow-peril/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">China</a>, which was very good. You can
find their shows <a href="http://fashthenation.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">here</a>.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
