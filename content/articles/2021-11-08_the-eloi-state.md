A truth learned from the study of economics is that competition between
suppliers tends to create better products and services. Better in the
economic context does not always mean more innovative or better quality.
Sometimes the better product is simply more cost effective than the
alternatives. The Wintel computer was never the technologically superior
option, but it was the most cost effective. Competition often arrives at
the solution that is merely good enough.

On the other hand, when companies or industries are able to shield
themselves from competition they tend to decline in quality. The prices
creep up as the quality and selection declines. The domestic car makers
in America experienced this in the middle of the last century. By the
1970’s, their cars were silly and unreliable. Competition from overseas
forced them to compete and that made for better cars. Competition is the
economic equivalent of accountability.

The time traveler in the H. G. Wells novel *The Time Machine* observed
that “It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility
is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble.” A corollary is
that responsibility and a sense of duty is the compensation for
accountability. A natural consequence of accountability is a duty and
obligation to the rules under which you operate. When you are held
accountable for your actions, you act in private as if the world is
watching.

We see this in the whole “go woke, go broke” meme. The fact that none of
these woke firms go broke is the important piece. That is the reason
corporate America is rushing to embrace the most absurd things. They
know they will never be held accountable for their actions, so they have
no duty to the rest of us. The people who made the perverted Twix
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2uq_JXRiic" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">commercial</a> did it because it costs them nothing.
Mars is a massive global enterprise immune from the marketplace.

The tech sector is the most obvious example. They have spent decades
colluding with one another to suppress wages and deny people their civil
rights because they never have to worry about consequences. They may
compete with one another at the fringes, but in essence they are a
cartel with monopoly power. It is not as if you are going to build your
own internet. The market forces we think should exits to hold these
firms accountable no longer exists, so they do as they please.

This has been true of politics for a long time. The CIA put out a report
in the late 1980’s claiming that the Soviet Union is getting stronger
due to the massive success of the Gorbachev reforms. A few months later
the Soviet empire collapsed. No one was ever held accountable. In fact,
it is fair to say that the power of the Soviets had been overstated for
generations. No one was ever held to account, so this was pushed aside
with the other lies and blunders.

More recently, many of the same characters were involved in selling the
world on the great Muslim threat. The West was turned into a police
state because the Muslims wanted to impose Islam-o-fascisms on us.
Trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives were spent on a
problem that never existed. Since no one would ever be held accountable
for the result, not one felt a duty to be right. They just made up
whatever would benefit them at the moment.

Even closer to home, there was a local election last week that got
national attention as a referendum on the parties. The Virginia governor
race was a big success for the Republicans, who immediately used their
new political capital to fink on their voters and support the other
side. They did it because they know they will never be held accountable
for it. Politics is now entirely immune from the marketplace of ideas,
so there is no accountability and therefore no responsibility.

We see the same thing in the media. For half a decade they sold the
Russian conspiracy hoax to the public. The recent indictments shows that
they knew it was a lie when they were selling it. Everyone involved knew
it was fake. No one will resign in disgrace or offer a tearful apology.
They simply laugh and move onto the next hoax they are told to peddle.
There is no shame because there is no accountability. What are you going
to do, build your own mass media?

The lack of shame is perhaps the final stage. A reckless disregard for
duty can still elicit shame, even if the person knows they will never be
held accountable. Once this lack of accountability is normalized,
morality collapses. Without morality, there can be no shame, which is
what we see with the media. They are shameless because the people in the
media no longer possess the normal moral coding. If they have a moral
code at all, it is based in a disdain for the rest of us.

The central question posed by *The Time Machine* is whether life can go
on without struggle and if so, should it? The two halves of future
humanity, the Elois and Morlocks were scarcely human. They had reached a
point where they had conquered the necessary conditions of human
civilization. Once struggle had been eliminated, the skills to win the
struggle atrophied. What the time traveler observed was not the apex of
humanity, but the end of it.

A similar question can be asked about the collapse of accountability.
Can a society survive when the people in charge of it are no longer
responsible for it? The climax of the Enlightenment project appears to
be a world in which the people at the top have finally been insulated
from all accountabilities. Oddly, they are the Eloi ruling over the
Morlocks, feckless children oppressing what they view as the lesser
beasts. Is this the apex of Western civilization or the end of it?
