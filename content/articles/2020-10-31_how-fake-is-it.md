An old expression in the collectibles world is that anything that has
value will eventually be faked or stolen. Art is faked so often that
certain types of art have lost all value, because no one can tell the
fakes from the genuine items. It’s not just crooks trying to beat the
rules of the game. The <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/07/18/baseball-card-collectors-suspected-rampant-fraud-their-hobby-now-fbi-is-investigating/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people responsible for
policing the fraud</a> are often the people perpetrating the fraud. The
truth is, anything that does not have objective value, but relies on
insiders, will be subject to fraud and theft.

It is something to keep mind when thinking about the future of internet
properties like the big socials and media sites. They rely on traffic to
generate revenues from advertisers and those interested in their traffic
data. Twitter does not make much from actual ads on the platform, but
they sell user information to those interested in tracking your
whereabouts on-line and in the real world. That traffic data is
essentially what makes it possible for internet properties to thrive.

That brings up that old maxim of the collectibles business. Who is
authenticating the data and appraising its value? There are sites that
claim to measure web traffic. Like the ratings services for radio and
television, they claim to have a secret way to sample traffic and then
estimate over all traffic. Obviously, the sites themselves have their
traffic, which they use to pitch advertisers, investors and in the case
of politics, the donors that keep these operations running.

Of course, the ratings systems for radio and television have been
subject to <a
href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6141002/univision-ratings-scandal-someone-needs-to-put-these-cheaters-in-check"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shenanigans</a> for the same
reason art is faked. Those ratings have value, so if you can fake those
ratings, it’s like having free access to the bank vault. The ratings
themselves are published so the unscrupulous can make bold claims.
“We’re number one among left-handed Korean midgets” becomes “we’re
number one in our segment.” It is a bandit market and the ratings help
facilitate it.

In the internet world, capturing web traffic is a bit more complex.
That’s where services like SimilarWeb and Alexa step in to provide hard
data. Well, it is supposed to be hard data, but where they get their
data is not easy to know. They are a bit cagey about how they arrive at
their numbers. Alexa claims to rely on a browser plugin and site owners
installing their script. SimilarWeb claims to get data from a panel of
hundreds of millions of web users, as well as a sample of websites.

How accurate is the data? Probably not very accurate at all. Consider
the British political site
<a href="https://unherd.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Unherd</a>. The
<a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/unherd.com"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexa</a> rankings don’t give
us overall traffic, but the
<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/unherd.com/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SimilarWeb</a> ratings tell us
they get 1.6 million visitors per month. Is that real? There’s no way to
know based on the data provided. It looks like a lot of their traffic
comes from aggregators, rather than real people. Then again, how many of
their readers would install an Alexa browser plugin? Probably very few.

For small sites that deal in politics, traffic is not that big of an
issue, as their donors are not targeting a mass audience. What about
other types of data like YouTube views or Twitter followers? If that
data real? It’s clear that Twitter is loaded with fake accounts, but how
many are *their* fake accounts? It could be
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38724082"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions</a> by now. How many
are used by Twitter to boost users they like? No one can know, but it is
not hard to see how that would be something they do for public relations
reasons.

Think about it. Twitter is the preferred social media platform of the
establishment media, so it is Twitter’s interest to make them happy.
That is, in part, why they are feverishly scrubbing anything that vexes
the gentle souls in the press corps. How hard would it be for them to
ramp up the follower counts and likes on those same media accounts with
their army of robot user accounts? Follower counts have value, so it is
a safe bet those follower counts are being faked by all interested
parties.

It is not just fraud, which is probably rampant in all of these measures
of internet activity, but incompetence plays a role. YouTube views will
go backwards, because thousands of accounts have been purged. This
happens on Twitter as well. Of course, Google breaking its own search
algorithm to prevent you from seeing what you like has probably crippled
the view counts on YouTube. In other words, One type of deception is
colliding with another type of deception.

The <a
href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/when-procter-gamble-cut-200-million-in-digital-ad-spend-its-marketing-became-10-more-effective/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">big players</a> who make up
the bulk of ad buying are starting to figure out that web traffic is not
all it is claimed to be. Placing ads on a social media platform is worse
than a waste of money. If a company made a video of the executive
burning piles of their cash and then posted it on YouTube, they would
get more sales from that video than running a regular YouTube ad.
Eventually, this becomes obvious to everyone and the ad market on-line
begins to dry up for these sites.

The real value in these internet properties, obviously, is in the data
they steal from users and sell to governments and corporations. Like the
ad business, the fraud in this data will eventually become an issue. We
very well may be seeing the high water point for the big social media
players. Like the market for certain types of art, the inability to tell
the real thing from the fakes will collapse the market. In the end, it
will not be public contempt but their own shenanigans that ends their
reign of terror.

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is a tea,
but it has a mild flavor. It’s autumn here in Lagos, so it is my daily
beverage now.
