No one can know what the robot historians will call this age, but a
fairly good guess is they will call it the age of outrage. Everything is
driven by outrage. Either it is mentally unstable people outraged over
the normal operation of the world or it the mentally unstable trying to
get attention by outraging normal people. Outrage is the fuel that
drives public discourse and politics in this age.

Outrage is like crystal meth for some people. Once they get a hit, they
can think of nothing else but the next hit. Before long they are in one
of the many intensely on-line subcultures, getting outraged with the
other addicts. They cultivate their own outrage and share outrage with
others. Who they are is entirely defined within the outrage culture of
their new lifestyle. They are outrage junkies.

Sites like the Daily Beast and Huffington Post started out as legitimate
new media sites catering to a broad audience. It feels like a million
years ago, but both sites used to employ normal people. Until Arianna
Huffington decided to rip off her contributors and run off with the
cash, the HuffPo covered a broad range of topics. Now these sites simply
peddle outrage to the addicts.

Just like other drug problems, the GrifterCons use the plague of outrage
to separate normal people from their money. The Conservative Industrial
Complex exists to tell normal people about the latest outrages. Instead
of showing video of addicts on the streets, it is video of abortion
protestors and Antifa rioters. If you send them money, they promise to
do something about it. They never do anything about it.

At some point normal people get tired of being outraged by the
outrageous behavior of these outrage addicts. You see it with the
abortion stuff. The chunky protestors showed up to outrage the onlookers
only to find very few people looking on. Outrage fatigue is a real thing
and you can be sure that the outrage addicts are outraged by it. Like
meth addicts, the outrage addicts always have a reason to get high.
