A mistake to which all of us are prone is to imagine that the future
will be just like the present, just with more. If you are Gloomy Gus,
the future will be more surveillance, more control and less liberty. If
you are Suzy Sunshine, the future will be flying cars and hot looking
women in Lycra jumpsuits. These are not conclusions drawn from evidence,
but the starting point for accumulating evidence.  
This is why humans have a fondness for rewriting history. Progressives
go so far as to cut themselves off from the past as it tends to
contradict much of what they believe. Normal people are content to just
pluck the lessons of the past that confirm their beliefs. Gloomy Gus
will compare today to the days before a great calamity. Suzy Sunshine
will use the same event to point out how much better things are now.  
The point here is that the future is probably not going to be better or
worse. It will simply be different. The things that are different will
feel better to the people of that age, because they will be living in
that age. Their customs and solutions will have evolved for the
challenges of their age. That’s the thing to keep in mind when thinking
about human societies. The social and political arrangements exist as
solutions to prior problems. They did not spring from nothing.  
Our mass democracy, for example, is no more a permanent feature of life
than slavery was a permanent feature in the 19th century. Slavery
stopped being useful to human society so it was eliminated. If democracy
stops being a benefit, then it will be junked in favor of something
thought to be a better fit for the time. Popular elections and
self-government are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The
attempt to democratize Iraq is a rather obvious example.  
The reason we have popular government is rich people needed an
alternative to inherited rule and autocracy, which were ill-suited to
commercial societies and dangerous in industrial societies. Allowing the
people to pick among acceptable options put forth by the upper classes
brought social stability, a thing the rich always want above all else.
You cannot maintain your position in a world of turmoil. Allowing the
masses to participate, brought stability so it evolved as the preferred
option.  
The West is now post-industrial. In fact, we are arguably in a
post-scarcity, technological society. The growing custodial state is a
response to technology and abundance. The old saying about idle hands
doing the Devil’s work is true. In the modern West, most hands are idle
for long periods of time. One could argue that the explosion of rules on
speech, conduct and privacy is a response to this.  
The question is whether mass democracy can still work in a mass media
culture with a custodial state. In 1992, which is roughly the dawn of
this current era, 35 million Americans voted in the party primaries.
Both parties had exciting races, but turnout was in line with prior
elections. In 2016, more than 70 million people will vote in these
primaries. The reason for this is it everyone has a stake in who is in
control of the custodial state.  
Low turnout used to be a topic of conversation in America. Europeans
voted in huge numbers while Americans tended to blow off elections.
That’s no longer the case as government in America has become almost as
pervasive as in Europe. When everything is political, which is the case
in a custodial state, everyone has to be political. In a prison, the
inmates know every tick and habit of the guards.  
This sounds like a winning formula. The rich people in charge offer up
acceptable options and the people come out in huge numbers to confirm
one or the other. But what if some nut job manages to win and gain
control of the all-powerful custodial state? Barak Obama was able to use
the IRS to harass opponents. What is some truly deranged guy gets into
the White House? What sort of damage could he do to the country?  
In a mass media age where the people interface with everything through
TV and the Internet, the guy who wins the election is the best actor on
screen. Donald Trump is winning the GOP primary because he is a master
of mass media. He’s been doing it his whole life. He’s running a modern,
21st century celebrity campaign and on the verge of toppling one of the
political parties.  
How many professional Republicans are big fans of democracy now?  
Now, I don’t think Donald Trump is a power-mad super-villain, who will
seize power once he wins the election. In all probability, he will usher
in a few reforms and otherwise be more of the same. That’s not what’s
important to the people in charge. They will quietly push their own
reforms in order to prevent the next Donald Trump, who may be the
charismatic super-villain they fear.  
The Democrats have already changed their nominating rules so the party
can put their thumb on the scale and block an insurgent candidate. The
super delegate system means Bernie Sanders could win every primary from
here on out and still not win the nomination. Party officials now
control so many delegates, they can pick the winner in spite of the
voters. The GOP will surely do something similar after this election to
make sure they never suffer another Trump.  
Beyond these changes to the party system, we are seeing the adoption of
the European habit of removing whole topics from popular consideration.
These are transferred to supra-national organizations that operate
beyond the will of national governments. The Trans-Pacific Partnership,
for example, is about removing trade and immigration discussions from
politics. There’s a push to circumvent the US Constitution by signing
off on arms control deals that strip citizens of their gun rights.  
As an aside, this steady transfer of power from the national government
to other entities may be a part of what’s driving voter participation
and anger, despite relatively good economic times. People sense that
control is slipping beyond their grasp so they are “getting involved” in
an attempt to arrest this development. That’s purely speculative, but a
byproduct of mass media is a loss of identity. We’re all plankton
floating in an ocean of information.  
I’ve gone on longer than I like so let me just finish by pointing out
that liberty is an anomaly. For almost all of human existence humans
have lived in authoritarian systems of one sort or another. The way to
bet is that what comes next is closer to the norm than the
constitutional liberty we think is the ideal. A generation from now,
voting may still exist, but be entirely meaningless, like the result of
a football game and no one will think it odd.
