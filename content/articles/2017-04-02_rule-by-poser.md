Way back when the Bush administration launched the invasion of Iraq, the
prevailing assumption among those who were in charge was that it would
be a cakewalk. The people would embrace us as liberators. People who had
some clue about how the world works knew it would be an ugly mess, as is
the case with all wars. War is, by definition, the ugliest of human
activities. It’s purpose is to kill and destroy.

Inevitably, stories turned up about abuses. One essential way to prepare
soldiers for war is to dehumanize the enemy. Men, even trained killers,
are not going to kill people they see as sympathetic. There’s no way to
finely calibrate the mind of a soldier so in every war there are abuses,
even when care is taken to avoid them. That’s why things like the Abu
Ghraib prison incident happened. War is and always will be an ugly
business.

That knowledge should lead Western governments to use their
technological and economic advantages to avoid getting into wars with
the barbarians on the edge of civilization. Instead, they start wars
they never intend to win, so they can preen and pose about their virtue
and morality, when something terrible inevitably happens. <a

There you have it. He handed down a sentence as a public act of
piety, signalling to the other lunatics in the ruling class that he is
some sort of special snowflake for throwing the book at this soldier.
It’s also why the West has not won any wars in a long time. Instead of
focusing all energy on killing the enemy and breaking their stuff, all
energy is put into maintaining moral superiority, even if that means
losing.

The point of war is to kill the enemy and break up their stuff. The hope
is they quit before you kill all of them and break all of their stuff,
but you plan otherwise. If the Afghans knew all along that helping Osama
bin Laden was most likely going to mean their cities and large towns
would be flattened, they would have chose differently. Let’s assume they
played it the same and Bush had firebombed Kabul, what would have been
the result?

Yeah, there would have been a lot of hand-wringing and pearl clutching
in Washington, but every other nutjob in the Middle East would have been
re-calibrating his plans. A lot less death and destruction would have
come as a result. Instead we have decades of killing to no logical end.
We have an endless war of attrition just so Western leaders can have
chances to let us know that they paragons of virtue.

What’s truly insane about all of this is the people in charge seem to
care more about the opinion of the enemy than they do their own people.
Maybe Sgt Blackman should have been punished, but the only reason to
punish him is to maintain good order in the ranks. It’s not that he
killed a wounded man. It’s that he violated the rules of engagement and
encouraged others to do the same. It should be
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ZFG"
target="_blank">ZFG</a> about what the terrorist think.

But, that’s not the world today. Our rulers care more about foreigners
than they do their own people. If it were otherwise, the rulers would be
quick to paper over these sorts of incidents, defending their fellow
citizens against these sorts of accusations. Given their policy
preferences, and the way they conduct foreign policy, it is safe to say
they truly hate the rest of us. We have to hate them back.
