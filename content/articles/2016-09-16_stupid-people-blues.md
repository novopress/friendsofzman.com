The first time I met a big foot journalist, this was back in the 1980’s,
I was struck by what appeared to be the shallow stupidity of the guy. It
was not the normal dullness you get from low-IQ people. It was sort of
a confident stupidity. It was not just that the guy did not know what he
did not know; it was that he was sure he knew everything there was to
know, despite not knowing much about anything. In time I came to
understand that most big foot journalists are no different from beauty
pageant contestants in that a blithe dimness is an asset.

The reason for this is the news is mostly a performance. The big foot
“journalists” play a role for their publication. ESPN, for example, has
as guy they call Ian O’Conner and his job is to be the tweed jacket
intellectual. They kit him out in jeans, a sports jacket and turtleneck.
The viewer is supposed to accept him as the brainy, thoughtful sports
guy, who gives “perspective” to the news. In reality
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=3666" target="_blank">he is as
dumb as a goldfish</a>. The average beauty pageant contestant would be
embarrassed for him. Ian is too dumb to have self-awareness so he gladly
plays the role.

It’s not just sports where you find these blithering morons. Tucker
Carlson the other day said that modern journalists, and by that he meant
political reporters, are just <a
href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tucker-carlson-modern-journalists-are-dumb-rich-kids/article/2598358"
target="_blank">stupid rich kids</a>. The parents have done well so they
send their smart kid off to law school, while the dull one is sent off
to journalism school. The result is modern journalism is a culture
dominated by Ron Burgundy, nitwits too dumb to realize they are
stupid. An example of which is here in <a

target="_blank">this blog post at the Spectator</a>.

One of the more remarkable things about opinion writers for mainstream
publications is that they are staggeringly ignorant about what goes on
in their own offices. Comment sections kill profits at news sites? If I
did not know better, I would assume this was a gag, but reading the rest
of the post makes clear the guy writing it thinks it is true. The reason
news sites added comments is to *attract* readers. They did this because
they were hemorrhaging money. How does he not know this?

This is modern journalism in a nutshell. You have the fishbowl of
semi-retarded people hired to do a job a high school boys used to do.
Now, instead of high school grads, journalism employs middle-aged men
with advanced degrees in nonsense specialties like sociology.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Thompson"
target="_blank">Damian Thompson</a> has a Ph.D in the sociology of
religion, which is about as useful as a masters degree in sitting still.
But, you can be sure he has killed many hours boring his colleagues with
tales of his days at university.

The reason news sites are killing off comment sections is two-fold. One,
it is usually where you get the bits of the news story our betters
edited out in order to maintain the narrative. The “Minnesota man” in
the story is identified in the comments as Jorge Gonzalez, an illegal
from Guadalajara. It’s where the “suspect wearing a red shirt” is
identified as a black guy named T’Q’ull Ferguson with a Facebook page
full of pics of him holding a handgun and a bong. The comment sections
have become a leak in the system.

The other problem, especially for opinion sites like The Spectator, is
the comments have become the place that make the writers cry. Sure,
there’s lots of inane chatter in the comment threads, but it is also
where some smart people post corrections and point out the many glaring
logical errors. Guys like Damian Thompson have fragile psyches so seeing
their mistakes highlighted for everyone to see, right under their
posts, is a source of constant distress. Look at the first comment under
that blog post.

When you live in the snow globe of opinion journalism, the outside world
is horrifying. That’s why you went into the snow globe in the first
place, to get away from the cold, pitiless world of reality. The
Spectator is a collegial place where peers josh with one another, engage
in witty repartee, but always respect their “shared dignity.” Those
angry Dirt People in the comments with their facts and reason just don’t
get it. Many of them don’t even have a PhD. They are ruining it for
everyone!

The media’s new war on their readers is part of the general unrest we
are seeing in the West. People in the media have long viewed themselves
as the fourth estate, part of the ruling class, but policing the ruling
class. This was always nonsense. The press has always been staffed by
obsequious rumpswabs and toadies. The reason for that is noticing
is dangerous in the mass media so only the most blinkered and stupid
thrive. Suddenly, these dullards are learning that the rest of us have
