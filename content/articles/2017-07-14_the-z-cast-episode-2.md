This week I try to build on lessons learned from week one. I have
decided to create both a full episode and a collection of sub-episodes.
The full podcast will be on my
<a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/thezblog" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Spreaker</a> page and on my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC72OK5dPU__5mjUFU_6VzaQ"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The sub-episodes
will be on the YouTube channel only as that is just easier for me.
Converting these things to the YouTube format and uploading them is a
pain. There has to be a better way, but for now I’ll just suffer for my
art.

Here is the <a
