------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ancient Greeks had a rule at one time where anyone proposing a
change in the current laws did so with a rope around his neck. He stood
in front of the people with the noose around his neck and made his
appeal. If the people adopted his idea, then he removed the rope and
went on his way. If his idea was rejected, he was hanged using the noose
that was around his neck. Needless to say, this reduced the demand for
change to that which was obvious to the vast majority.

From time to time, as in a crisis, they would pass a rule with regards
to whatever course of action they agreed upon to address the crisis.
Anyone who questioned the agreed upon approach or offered up a change to
it, was killed or banished. The point of these extraordinary measures in
times of crisis was to prevent the minority from undermining the will of
the majority and thus the agreed upon policy. Once the majority agreed
upon a course of action, the time for debate ended.

While the idea of our current legislators offering amendments while
wearing a noose is amusing, we should be able to see why the Greeks did
this. In this age, all everyone talks about is change. The way to show
your virtue to the rest of those desperate for acclaim and affirmation
is to demand change. The managerial elite and their flunkies in the
managerial class spend so much time producing new changes, none of the
basic things are getting done.

This is because the spring of democracy is morality. In a democratic
society, even if it is not actually democratic, the thing that motivates
people is the desire to be seen as moral, which means on the side of the
people. When moderns say they are on the right side of history, what
they mean is they are on that leading edge of change that is carrying
the people toward the goal of the general will. They are turning the
wheel of progress toward the promised land.

We have no information to suggest the Greeks viewed it this way, but
they clearly understood that those always demanding change were a
menace. Even in a genuine democracy, someone has to be in charge so that
things get done. That person or group of people could not function if
they were constantly fielding criticism or adapting to new policies
pushed through by the change artists. The noose was the way to limit
this impulse and prevent the chaos we are experiencing today.

In this age, this would start with the Federal bench. The executive
branch of government is now hobbled by judicial fiat. Trump could get
nothing done because crazy judges kept inventing novel reasons to block
him. Some of his stuff eventually made it through, but the courts ran
out the clock on most of it. The same thing happens with governors. They
are constantly blocked by judges who just make up reasons to block their
policies.

A simple way to stop this is to institute a three strikes rule. A judge
who is overturned three times is removed from the bench. In a short
time, this would clear the court of most left-wing judges, who are
overturned on a regular basis. What would remain is judges who adhere to
the point of their role. Further, judges who are removed from the bench
are barred from practicing or teaching law. While banishment would be
the best option, removing them from the law is good enough.

A similar problem is in the legislatures. All across the country,
deranged state legislators have crafted new gun laws. These laws will be
struck down by the courts but create mayhem for years. These legislators
cook up these laws knowing they will not pass muster with the courts.
This is performative legislation. The point of it is to show the
intended audience that the legislator is on the right side of history,
mostly by tormenting the normal people who are the victims of these
laws.

While hanging is the right course here, a less entertaining option is to
impoverish the people who vote for laws that are overturned by the
courts. For example, when the courts overturn the latest gun grabbing
from the New York legislature, the people who voted for it have all of
their assets confiscated. They are immediately barred from politics and
practicing law. Instantly, the legislative calendars will be free to
work on the practical things that are currently neglected.

These small, common-sense changes are not a panacea, but what they would
do is reintroduce the idea of a limiting principle. The current civic
religion starts with the assumption that anything is possible. If
anything is possible, then your version of Utopia is possible, which
means it should happen right now. After all, what could be the argument
against having paradise right now? There has to be a way to anathematize
that impulse and thus curtail this behavior.

Of course, this would require a ruling class that sees the danger. The
Greeks were often blessed with an elite that knew society could tolerate
only so much debate and so much criticism, so they found ways to limit
it. Instead, the current ruling class celebrates the resulting chaos
that comes from a culture of critique. They somehow think that paradise
is a world where nothing is beyond the destructive forces that lie at
the heart of this endless demand for change that animates our age.

Joseph de Maistre famously said, “Every country has the government it
deserves”, but this is always misinterpreted to blame the people for bad
government. This is the thinking of the mind poisoned by democracy.
Joseph de Maistre was not a democrat, so it is incorrect to think he was
blaming the people. Instead, he was laying the blame at the feet of the
ruling class. The elite get the government they deserve and they take
the people with them, even if the people deserve better.
