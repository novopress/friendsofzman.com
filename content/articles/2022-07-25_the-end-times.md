------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many commenters have noted that American political discourse is much
coarser and nastier today than it was a generation ago. The change can
be dated to the arrival of the Clintons on the national stage in the
1990’s. They brought with them a crudeness that has become the norm in
national politics. The great
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=27257" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">interregnum</a> that lasted from the 1980’s into the
1990’s was replaced with an ugly and vulgar brand of politics that
eventually led to the nasty and censorious present.

The question that never gets asked is why has public discourse become so
nasty and unforgiving over the last three decades? The time for
intolerance was the Cold War when mistakes could mean nuclear war with
Russia. Instead, it was a time of relative tolerance compared to the
present. Technological and material advances have made the margin for
error extremely broad, yet the people seeking to shape public discourse
carry on like one misused pronoun will end the world.

There can be no denying that the nastiness and intolerance is coming
from the people we call the Left. The so-called conservatives continue
to carry on like they are at high tea with the queen. The censorship,
cancel culture and the harassment of dissenters all comes from the
tribes of the Left. They are the ones trying to ruin people for
explicitly stating obvious truths that suddenly run contrary to official
dogma. The mobs threatening social order are all left-wing.

The funny thing is, the Left should be riding high, given that they
control all of the high ground of American society. If the new fad on
the Left is for “birthing people” to wear flowerpots on their heads,
every news anchor will either have the flowerpot on her head or state in
advance that *they* are not a person of uterus so *they* are respecting
the culture of the birthing people. The Left has never had more power in
American society, yet they have never been angrier.

One reason for the nastiness is left-wing politics has always attracted
people who are full of self-loathing and have a resentment toward normal
society. This was true in the French Revolution and it is true today.
The conformity and identity provided by the hive mentality of radical
politics is the appeal. Radical politics is by definition anti-social,
so it attracts anti-social people. The phrase “happy go-lucky communist”
is not a staple of our language for a reason.

Of course, the cult-like atmosphere of radical politics limits the ways
in which a member can get attention. To get noticed by senior members of
the hive means being more extreme than the rest of the hive. Without a
limiting principle, virtue signaling quickly becomes a race to the most
extreme position. This is how we quickly went from finding a legal
accommodation to cohabitating homosexuals to a world where the Left
demands that child molesters in drag have unlimited access to grammar
schools.

Then there is the fact that people into left-wing politics tend to live
in isolation from normal people. They may interact with normals at work
or in daily life, but their political activity is exclusively around
fellow believers. These ideas arise in a world insulated from the daily
realty of normal society. The people operating like spiritual masters
inside these movements are never challenged or questioned. They are
never exposed to scrutiny or forced to defend their positions.

Someone like Robin DiAngelo is never going to sit down for a tough
interview by a knowledgeable critic of her ideas. All of the thought
leaders and influencers on the Left are like stage psychics in that they
only ever allow themselves to be tested under conditions that allow for
success. This serves to promote their brand, to use a marketing term,
but it also legitimizes their ideas to their followers. DiAngelo always
sounds authoritative, which serves to give authority to her ideas.

The counter here is that people on the Right do the same thing but the
big difference is the institutions are run by the Left. A normal person
cannot go about their life without running into left-wing assertions.
Watch a TV show and it is full of propaganda about the latest causes.
Ads are mostly for cultural ideas, rather than products. The workplace
is littered with warning signs about offending the believers. There is
no escaping the cult of progressive beliefs.

People on the Left can avoid almost all counter-programming. Normal
people are naturally polite and non-confrontational. As soon as they
learn that Sarah from accounting is a woke believer, word goes forth to
avoid talking current events with Sarah or her friends. On the other
hand, if a normal person dead names Barbara, formerly known as Robert,
Sarah and her coevals will be all over the poor guy, demanding he be
hurled into the void for intolerance.

This tendency toward politeness has the perverse effect of providing
social proof to the people in these subcultures. The guy getting thrown
into the void must deserve his fate as no one defends him, thus his
crime is validated. On the other hand, the lack of pushback from the
people around them, plus the intense loyalty of the people inside the
subculture, is daily confirmation. There is no social cost to holding
extreme ideas so the incentives to holding them are unchecked.

Compounding this is a poverty of information inside these movements.
Since the leaders are never exposed to scrutiny, their ideas are never
tested. In an environment of conformity, showing any doubt about the
ideas risks a loss of status inside the group, so no one dares question
anything. In the rare occasion when the members confront someone who
directly challenges their belief, it is as if the person is questioning
the very nature of reality. There must be something wrong with them.

This leads to the sort of performative
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJtkUNEZLlk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">confrontation</a> we saw in the Senate between Josh
Hawley and Berkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges. To normal people, the
professor came of as obnoxious and unbalanced. To the <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/pregnancyparenting/josh-hawley-is-no-match-for-this-uc-berkeley-professor/ar-AAZvk9d"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people in the subculture</a>, she
heroically defended the one true faith against the violent attacks of a
bigot. In other words, their brief confrontations with reality are
quickly turned into confirmation. The normal feedback loop is warped by
their general isolation.

All of this explains the increasing weirdness of the Left and the
intensity of belief, but it does not explain the nastiness. Fifty years
ago, progressives were just as committed to their agenda as they are
today, but back then they were prepared to debate anyone in public on
their issues. Today, the Left is trying hard to purge anyone from the
public square who is not enthusiastic for their cause. Fifty years ago,
the Left said you had to be open minded. Today, an open mind is
violence.

The most likely reason for this is the focus of belief has shifted from
the material world to the spiritual realm. In the 1980’s, lefty was all
about economics. Progressivism was a material cause, not a cultural one.
Today, the Left does not care about economics or the material wellbeing
of people. In fact, they seem to think the material wellbeing of people
is a danger to their cause. The evolving assault on food production in
the name of Gaia is looking like the actions of a suicide cult.

There is the key to the nastiness. Radical politics has always had a
religious vibe because ideology is a secular replacement for religion.
Instead of God providing authority to the beliefs, it is the will of the
people or the tides of history. Until this age, ideology was rooted in
the material world. The door through which mankind would enter paradise
was economic relations. Today, the door is cultural relations. Once all
cultural barriers are removed, everyone is free to fulfill their
potential.

The old ideology of the Left had a tangible vision. They thought that in
the future, a man would be able to fish in the morning, hunt in the
afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and do critical theory at night.
He would be free to live as he chose because his material wellbeing
would be secure. The new religion offers an image of the present like a
haunted house, in which the monsters are normal people. How can you be a
happy warrior when you imagine yourself surrounded by spiritual enemies?

What we may be seeing is the end of ideology. Ideology is a new thing in
human history, which means it has a beginning and therefore an end. This
great replacement for religion as the set of shared societal beliefs may
be in an end phase. The reason it is so nasty and violent is the same
reason a trapped animal is nasty and violent. Suicide cults choose death
over disbelief. This last ideology is looking to destroy this fallen
world rather than give up their beliefs.
