I’ve always been a skeptic of Facebook, mostly because I don’t
understand how they make money. I mean, I know *how* they make money,
but I don’t know *why* they make money. It’s just a crappy platform for
the technologically inept to post pictures of their cat. Facebook
charges companies a fee so they can put ads next to the picture of your
cat, but why those companies do it is a mystery to me. The whole thing
depends upon ordinary people being interesting and looking at those ads,
which no one does.

This stuff is not new. <a

This video from a couple of years ago sounds a lot like what is in the
NYPost story.

Of course, we have a word for this. It’s called fraud. There was a time
when something like this would have resulted in the executives at
Facebook being led out in chains. Advertisers should be walking away and
the stock should be tanking, but that’s not the modern age. Robbing your
customers and vendors is just the way it is done at this level. You
never give a sucker and even break or smarten up a chump. Ours is a
grifter culture where everyone is running a scam.
