**Note:** I did a 90-minute

have to say it was a very enjoyable conversation. The Monday

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Western media has been set to frame the war in Ukraine as a replay
of the events in the 1930’s, with a healthy does of American moralizing.
Putin is Hitler, of course, and Ukraine is the totally innocent victim.
The narrative this time is different, because the “good guys” were ready
and they have lured Putin into a trap. Biden made public what has been
said privately, which is that Washington is planning regime change for
Russia and then will move onto regime change in China.

It is entirely possible that this admission is not the result of a Biden
gaffe or a bit of 4-D chess by his handlers. instead, this may be part
of a trap laid by China, and to a lesser degree, Russia. Joe Biden
admitted what most world leaders have understood since the war in Iraq.
That is, the Global American Empire has no respect for the politics of
other countries, so if they see those politics as a hindrance, they will
try to decapitate the government and install a friendly regime.

Further, the reckless response by Washington to the Russian invasion has
caused most of the world to rethink the global financial system. Saudi
Arabia is now talking with China about doing business in something other
than dollars. India has struck a deal with Russia to do business in
rupees. India and Russia are now using China’s alternative to the SWIFT
system for bank communications. Suddenly there is a race to build
parallel financial structures by most of the world.

The primary beneficiary of this result is China. The reason the world
prefers to do business in dollars and use US treasuries as collateral is
the system of rules governing global finance are rooted in the dollar as
the default currency. Those rules benefit America at the expense of the
world, but the trade-off has been a fixed and predictable set of rules,
including responsible management of the global currency. That trade-off
no longer makes sense thanks to Washington’s actions.

That has been the primary result of the sanctions. Washington broke the
basic rules of the system to launch this attack on Russia. Cutting off
Moscow has been seen by most of the world as a violation of the basic
promise of the system. Cutting of the Russian central bank without
consulting the rest of the world is probably going to be viewed as the
great mistake of this whole affair. That is supposed to be a punishment
agreed upon by the world in only the worst cases.

The question no one is asking is whether China saw this as a potential
outcome of the Russian invasion. They seem to have been prepared for it.
Similarly, Russia seems to have been prepared for the assault. The ruble
declined but stabilized after the Moscow central bank stepped into
stabilize it. China was ready to meet with India and Russia to work out
a joint response. Even South Africa seems to have been in the loop on
what to do if Washington came down hard on Russia.

The fact is, Russia never would have gone into Ukraine without knowing
the Chinese would backstop them financially. Russian is a big powerful
country, but it is a relatively poor country so it cannot go it alone
for too long. It is true that Iran has figured out how to get around the
sanctions regime, but Russians have had a taste of the good life and
would no doubt tire of the hardships. With China and India bucking the
sanctions regime, those hardships are now greatly minimized.

Reports indicate that Washington was telling Beijing that Moscow was
plotting the invasion and may have signaled their response. China has
plenty of spies embedded in Washington, as well as the big social media
companies. People forget that China <a
href="https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2015/06/opm-to-notify-employees-of-cybersecurity-incident/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">downloaded</a> the data from the Office
of Professional Management. They have lots of close friends in
Washington politics. The point being is that China probably had a good
idea of what America was planning as a response.

If you look at a map, what you see is that most of the world is not
going along with the sanctions regime on Russia. Instead of the West
isolating Russia, it looks like it is the rest of the world isolating
the West. More important, the cost of the sanctions regime is hitting
the West where they feel it, their wallets. Prices are soaring in
Western countries for food and fuel. Britain is about to experience the
<a
href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cost-of-living-uk-gdp-growth-inflation-b2042284.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest drop</a> in the standard of
living since records have been kept.

It very well may be that the reason Russia invaded Ukraine is it was
part of a much larger plan to deal with the Global American Empire.
Russia saw the chance to reassert her ancient claims in eastern Europe
and weaken NATO. China saw the chance to bait Washington into smashing
its own financial system. The rest of the world is objectively looking
at things and seeing a new multipolar world. They want to be on good
terms with all of the new power centers of the future.

It is too soon to know if Washington is being played, but the
indications thus far suggest they do not see what is happening.
Allegedly, the Biden people did not talk to the Federal Reserve about
their sanctions regime. This is why cutting off the Moscow central bank
has blown up in their face. That is the sort of error that suggests the
decision makers are not thinking things through. They also seem to have
fell for the military assessments from the Pentagon.

We will know much more in the coming months, but it is possible that
what we are seeing is the result of a clever trap laid out by Beijing
and Moscow. The war in Ukraine is just one piece of a larger puzzle.
This is a puzzle clear to everyone but Washington, which is still high
off the fumes of the 1990’s. They still believe they are at the end of
history and leading the world to the promised land. Instead, they may be
leading the West into a massive financial disaster.
