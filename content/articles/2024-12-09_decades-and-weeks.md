------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lenin famously said, “There are decades where nothing happens; and there
are weeks where decades happen” The world has just experienced, and
perhaps is continuing to experience, those weeks where decades happen.
There is the war in Ukraine, of course, which keeps tempting the world
to the abyss, but now there is the collapse of Syria, which promises to
make the Middle East more dangerous. On top of that is the political
crises in South Korea, France and Romania.

The easiest to diagnose is the Ukraine crisis, which has been creeping
toward a conclusion most have understood since it started. The Russian
army is slowly grinding up the Ukrainian army, which is slowly
retreating. Slowly has been slowly becoming quickly, leading to rumors
that big changes await Kiev. Zelensky has all but volunteered to be
Trump’s personal footstool to find out what, if anything, Trump plans to
do about Ukraine in 2025. The answer is probably nothing.

For their part, the Russians seem to have decided that they will have to
sort things out despite whoever is running American foreign policy. The
thing to watch is who Tucker Carlson has on from the Trump team after he
returns from Russia. There is a good chance that Tucker is operating as
an unofficial go between for Trump or who Trump will trust to manage the
Ukraine problem. Regardless, the end of Project Ukraine promises to be
weeks where decades happen.

The problem that promises to create lots of chaos for the world is the
unexpected collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. One of the things you
must learn when doing business in the Arab word is that nothing is ever
as it appears. That is most certainly true with the fall of Assad and
his exile in Russia. While it is clear that the Turks trained and
supplied the “rebel” army, made up of mercenaries from around the Muslim
world, it is unlikely that they anticipated this result.

It is also certain that the United States and Israel had a hand in
developing this “rebel” army and setting it on its course. Like everyone
else, they appear to have been unprepared for this result. Strangely,
the Russians and the Iranians seem to have anticipated this result or at
least were the first to see what was happening, so maybe they had a hand
in this as well. The Russians have been operating in that part of the
world for generations, so they understand Arab reality.

What we know is that Syria is now “controlled” by a collection of Muslim
fanatics who have little in common with one another. They lack the
resources and manpower to remain in control for long, so that means the
many other factions and their sponsors will be looking to either flow
into the void left by Assad or carve out more space for themselves in
what used to be Syria. Iran, Russia, Israel, the United States and the
Gulf countries will be backing their proxies in this chaos.

As an aside, the Trump demand that the United States stay out of the
Syrian crisis is only going to make things worse. One reason is we will
see a flood of refugees from Syria into Europe. This will be done on
purpose to draw the West into the conflict, despite what Trump says.
Then you have the portion of the foreign policy blob that exists to
“manage” the Middle East. There is zero chance that they stay out of of
what they see as an early Christmas present.

The Arabs are not having all the fun. South Korea just had an attempted
coup, which saw the current president try to arrest parliament. The
parliament fought back against martial law and then the president backed
down. Then parliament tried to impeach the president but could not find
the votes. If you want a laugh, Costin Alamariu did a <a
href="https://medium.com/@CostinAlamariu/rule-of-the-global-eunuch-88ef02a3e64c"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">piece</a> on the bizarre politics of
Korea. If North Korea decides it is time to invade South Korea, no one
should be surprised.

Europe also is experiencing weeks in decades now. The Romanians tried to
have an election, and things did not turn out as expected. They
carefully followed the rules of “our democracy” by banning opposition
parties and making sure the media ignored anyone questioning the
authority of the regime. The result was the “far-right” candidate won a
big victory in the first round and was holding a massive lead heading
into the second round, so the Romanians annulled the election.

The reason they annulled the election is they said there must have been
Russian interference causing the unexpected result. You see the logic of
“our democracy” in how Western rulers operate. “Our democracy” is a
system that always confirms their righteousness and their right to rule.
Any other result means someone or something has sabotaged “our
democracy.” Since “our democracy” is sacred, any means necessary must be
employed to defend it, even annulling elections.

There is something similar happening in France. Last summer, the French
populist party scored a stunning win in the first round of legislative
elections. This is the party led by the Le Pen family. They were poised
to win a majority in the national Assembly until Macron conspired with
the other parties to rig enough seats to prevent it. Then Macron finked
on his partners and appointed a prime minister none of his partners
liked, which has now led to the collapse of the government.

Convention says that when the government is paralyzed this way, there
are new elections to break the deadlock. The only way this can happen is
for Macron to resign, which he is not going to do, because Notre
démocratie est trop importante pour la laisser aux mains des électeurs.
This means France is currently without a government, other than Macron
playing the organ grinder’s monkey to Trump. French bonds are now less
attractive to investors than Greek bonds.

The political chao in France is a foreshadowing of what lies ahead for
all the EU countries as the bill for Project Ukraine comes due. Germany
is headed for elections in 2025, and they are desperately trying to
avoid a Romanian result, so they will probably jail anyone who could be
a problem. Britain is now ruled by a party that is slightly less popular
than rectal cancer. The opposition party, the Tories, is led by a clown
they imported from Nigeria.

Overall, the European economy is in serious trouble. It is a thing that
Western media ignores, for the most part, but anyone doing business in
Europe or with companies having exposure to Europe understands. It turns
out that an economy built on cheap energy from Russia performs poorly
when that cheap energy from Russia is replaced by expensive energy from
America and even more expensive energy from Russia, sold through Asian
intermediaries.

What all of this points to as we close out the year is that what lies
ahead is a time when decades happen in weeks. The looming chaos that is
the next Trump administration only adds to the uncertainty. Through no
fault of his own, Trump will inherit an empire surrounded by chaos of
its making but lacking the human capital to understand the problems and
set them right. Instead, it will be old solutions to the new problems,
meaning this may seem like a calm time by comparison.
