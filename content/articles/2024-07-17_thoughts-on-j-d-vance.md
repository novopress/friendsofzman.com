Trump’s selection of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate was not
a total shock to the system, but the system was unhappy, nonetheless.
The old neocons are howling in agony, claiming he is
<a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/the-authoritarian-ticket"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">another Hitler</a>. The slow-witted
neocons are similarly unhappy, but they are <a
href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/dispatch-politics/vance-is-in-reaganism-is-out/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">going with</a> the “he’s not Reagan”
line. These are the people who claimed George Bush II was the heir to
Reagan. The dried out husk of Buckley conservatism is going with their
<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">usual perfidy</a>.

It is not just the yesterday men of the official right who are unhappy.
The more strident of the online right are vexed that Vance is married to
an Indian and was once a member in good standing of the regime. They
think he is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They look at this slot on the
ticket as the heir to Trump and therefore the guy who will lead the
cause after Trump’s term ends in 2028. They wanted someone who was more
clearly on their side, even though such a person does not exist.

The problem with all of this analysis is that it operates within the
conventional framework of politics. Despite his civic nationalist
inclinations, Trump is the nullification of the conventional political
framework. Over the last decade, there have been two main camps
regarding Trump. There are those who think he will operate the levers
and gears of the machine to their liking or not to their liking and
those who get that he exists to destroy the machine, even as he tries to
operate it.

With that in mind, the election of Vance should be seen as Trump
starting to understand what is happening. People forget that he was set
to announce his pick after the debate, but then put it off so the focus
could be on Biden. Vance was most likely not the pick at that point.
Tucker Carlson said that Trump decided on Vance around the day he
announced the pick. In other words, there is a good chance that Trump’s
brush with death had some impact on his thinking.

The way to view Vance ideologically is as a compromise between Trump,
the civic nationalist, and his core base of support. Trump and his older
voters maintain that the system of America is fine. The trouble is the
people running the system. It is why they are so invested in Trump the
man. Vance and the subculture in which he primarily exists understands
that the system is the problem. They are not revolutionaries, but they
think systemic change is necessary to avoid disaster.

Some get this to a degree. Patrick Deneen
<a href="https://x.com/PatrickDeneen/status/1813533452332855652"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">uses</a> different language to describe
Vance, but the idea is the same. This Wall Street Journal <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-d-vance-and-the-rise-of-postliberalism-1f200696"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> comes at the topic from a more
dissident perspective. Graedon H. Zorzi is a worth a follow if you are
interested in more nuanced analysis of current events. If you look at
the <a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1813511777214406903"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">list of people</a> Vance follows on
social media, it is a list of people who think critically about
politics. In one fashion or another, they are critics of the system.

What Vance represents, and you can put people like Christopher Rufo in
the same bucket, is either a final defense of the system or a waystation
on the road to what Charles Murray
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJHTdlug7oY&amp;t=33s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">calls</a> the white backlash. This
subculture that produced Vance is both a compromise between white
identity politics and the old civic nationalism, and a synthesis of the
two. It is an identitarianism that is majority white, but tolerant of a
fringe that is not white, but fully assimilated.

None of this is to say that this is deliberate. There is no evidence
that any of the people in this subculture think of themselves as
gatekeepers or facilitators. They are simply staking out ground that is
morally tolerable yet they are realistic about what is actually
happening in the flesh and blood country called America. To a great
degree, they are reactionaries, responding to the fantasy world that is
the conservative response to the madness falling from the clouds of the
managerial elite.

This is what gets missed in the criticism of Vance from the online
right. Vance was not a political guy and when he was encouraged to get
into politics, he adopted the politics of the people around him. When he
got a good look at what those politics meant, he reacted negatively and
started down the path that led him to this point. Anyone who has been to
a dissident event has heard a version of this story many times. The
people Vance chooses to follow all have similar stories.

The question that remains to be answered is if this subculture that
produced Vance can create a plausible political program and challenge
the orthodoxy. So far, they have stalled where prior efforts have
stalled. They present their analysis of the system and then when asked,
“now what?”, they have no answer. Patrick Deneen’s last book is a great
example. He explains the defects of what he calls liberalism but then
gets frightened by the implications and quits the project.

Another angle to this is that this subculture has attracted the interest
and limited support from members of the oligarchy. Peter Thiel and Elon
Musk are two examples of billionaires who seem to support this project.
Claremont operates like a political version of Y Combinator, sponsoring
people and projects within this space. Some have proven to be defective,
like Richard Hanania, but others, like the IM1776 project or Passage
Press, have been more successful.

Trump tapping into this space and thus getting support from members of
the oligarchy bodes well for him and the subculture that produced Vance.
No reform effort can survive without elite support. This not only bodes
well for the project, but it means Trump has a chance to not only win
the election but get something done. Proof that the universe has a sense
of humor is that this is the real Flight 93 election, a last attempt by
reform minded oligarchs to save the system.
