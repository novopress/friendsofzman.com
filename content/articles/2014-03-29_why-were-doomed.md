rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This piece</a> in National
Journal is a good example of why America is doomed. It’s not that
Gingrich is a festering carbuncle of man or that he is a moral nullity.
Politics, going back to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alcibiades</a>, has been
populated with loathsome parasites. It’s that people like Gingrich are
now the bets the ruling class can offer. He’s not some unusual character
that appears from time to time. he is the norm. Now society can last
when it is ruled by people who write things like this.

*Within a year, nine out of 10 Americans could be dead. And whatever
causes the national apocalypse—be it North Korean malice or the whims of
the sun—the downfall will ultimately be our own fault.*

*That’s the fear of Newt Gingrich and other members of a high-profile
coalition who are convinced that our fragile electrical grid could be
wiped out at any moment.*

*Their concern? Electromagnetic pulses, the short bursts of
energy—caused by anything from a nuclear blast to a solar flare—that can
wreak havoc on electrical systems on a massive scale. And the coalition
believes it’s coming soon.*

*“I think we’re running out of time,” said Peter Pry, a former CIA
officer and head of a congressional advisory board on national security.
And if the worst happens? “This gets translated into mass fatalities,
because our modern civilization can’t feed, transport, or provide law
and order without electricity,” he said.*

*While some see the coalition as alarmist—and others dismiss them as
out-and-out quacks—the coalition boasts some prominent and influential
names. Pry and Gingrich are joined by former CIA Director James
Woolsey.*

*“It wasn’t difficult persuading them” to join the coalition, Pry said.
Gingrich “has known about EMP and cared about it for many years.”*

*Last year, Gingrich told members of Congress that an EMP attack “could
be the kind of catastrophe that ends civilization—and that’s not an
exaggeration.”*

What does Gingrich know about physics? The answer is nothing. He was a
history instructor at a strip mall college and he likes dinosaurs.
There’s nothing wrong with history. Lots of people are history buffs.
It’s that history is not science, so even if you are a well regarded
historian, your opinions on science are no better than the guy who mops
the floor at the university. In fact, in this case, the guy mopping the
floor has the good sense to know this material is out of his reach.

The fact that the nation takes seriously a guy like Gingrich on
anything, much less issues he is uniquely unqualified to discuss is far
more worrisome than solar flares or an nuclear attack. Gingrich is a
crank and not the funny entertaining type either. He is the weird guy
who lives at the end of the lane type of crank. The guy parents warn
their kids to avoid. His ideas are mostly nonsense, but he believes them
with the intensity of a fanatic. This is not a guy who should have power
over others.
