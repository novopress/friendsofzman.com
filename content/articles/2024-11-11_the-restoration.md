**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about the weird noises
coming from the regime after the election, a post about the odd quiet
that we are seeing after Trump swept the field and the Sunday podcast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legend has it that at the start of the trial of English King Charles I,
Oliver Cromwell saw the king approaching Westminster Hall and realized
he had a problem. He quickly warned his fellow parliamentarians that the
king would ask a very straightforward question at the opening of the
trial. He would demand to know upon what authority was he being brought
to a trial. This is, in fact, what happened. Charles refused to enter a
plea on the grounds the court had no authority over him.

The drama about Cromwell seeing the king’s approach and then suddenly
seeing his problem is apocryphal, as the parliamentarians had been
debating this issue since the end of the Second English Civil War.
According to English law, the king could not be tried for breaking the
law. Logically, the king was the law. The king was the sovereign and
therefore the embodiment of the nation and its laws. Putting the king on
trial was putting the system itself on trial.

Cromwell and his pals got around this problem by simply wielding the
power they had, which was the force of arms, to override objections from
members of parliament, the House of Lords and the king himself. When
Charles asked “I would know by what power I am called hither. I would
know by what authority, I mean lawful authority”, the parliamentarians
decided that “the King of England was not a person, but an office whose
every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern.”

In other words, the long-held principles both sides claimed to support,
over which they fought two bloody wars to that point, gave way to
political expediency. Cromwell and the New Model Army had power, and
they were determined to keep it, which meant killing the king and what
he represented. If it meant trampling a thousand years of tradition and
the law itself, they were prepared to do it. The trial proceeded as if
the Charles confessed his guilt, and he was soon executed.

The French Revolution gets all the attention when it comes the crisis of
liberalism, but it is the English Civil War that presents the problem
plainly. By what authority can a parliament rule over a people? The
answer always given is the people, but by what authority do the people
have to pick their rulers? Where is it written that the people are the
moral arbiter of society? Modern people think the answer is obvious, but
for most of human history people thought the opposite.

The reason we have that story about Cromwell looking out of the window
of Westminster Hall and suddenly realizing his dilemma is because people
at the time understood the power of authority. The king was just a man,
but what he represented was earthly dominion over man. No one looked at
the king as just a man because he was the final authority, the one man
who was an exception to the law, while being the embodiment of the law.
He was the sovereign.

It is why after Cromwell’s death, the monarchy was restored. Despite it
all, Cromwell was never able to answer the question posed by Charles at
his trial. The authority of Parliament is in the law, but the authority
of the law is in the king. Without a king, those in control of
Parliament were left with force as their authority. It is easy to see
why Mao famously said that political power comes from the barrel of a
gun. The question of authority has haunted the world since that famous
trial.

We are getting a glimpse of this with the election of Trump. Fifty years
ago, the managerial class staged a coup against Nixon. Like the Rump
Parliament that deposed Charles I, they acted extrajudicially but
claimed to be doing so in defense of the law, which is a contradiction
that cannot be resolved. They rid themselves of the imperial presidency,
reducing the office and the rest of the political structures to
committees controlled by the managerial class.

Then as now, the central question in the crisis is who says? Much of
what constitutes the crisis of the American empire is people shouting
from screens, demanding you must do this or must stop doing that.
Everywhere you turn is a digital preacher, waging her bony finger at you
and lecturing about your sins. The Roundhead ascendency that began with
Watergate climaxed with men in dresses calling normal people sinners,
but always the question remained. Who says?

The restoration of Donald Trump is an answer of sorts. Whatever his
faults, Trump is a man who commands attention and respect. When he
enters a room, the room changes because he is larger than life. He
persevered over the last four years of official persecution through
force of will. He returns to Washington as the leader of the victorious
side in the cold civil war that has gripped the country. He also returns
with an agenda and a mandate to execute it.

None of this is to say that Trump is the monarch or our moral authority.
The point of the comparison is that the executive exists to replicate
that role in a democratic system that lacks a moral authority. Without
energy in the executive, the president cannot play the role the system
requires to function. The last fifty years has seen the rise of rule by
committee, and no one builds monuments to committees. Just as Parliament
needed the king, Washington needs Trump.

It still leaves open that question. Monarchy solved the problem by
making the king the sovereign and the answer to who says? In America,
Christianity was assumed to be the answer most of the time. The
exceptions required a strong executive to make the hard decisions and
force the legislature to act. First the melting away of Christianity
then the toppling of the strong executive left us with rule by committee
and the fanciful chants about democracy to answer the question of
authority.

Trump will not reign forever, so the question will return. Perhaps the
managerial elite sees the problem and supports the return of the
imperial presidency as a solution to the internal contradictions of
managerialism. Maybe the economic elite supports the strong executive as
a proxy for their supremacy over the managerial class, much in the way
the king was the leader of the aristocracy. Maybe Washington falls into
chaos again, as managerialism reaches its end.

In the end, political systems rise and fall on the question of
authority. The moral questions in every society are either answered by
the gods or by the people though their traditions and customs. Centuries
of experience in self-government says we simply cannot accept “because
we say so” as an answer. You either have a strong executive with the
power to impress or you have a shared religion that answers all the
important moral questions. Managerialism has neither.
