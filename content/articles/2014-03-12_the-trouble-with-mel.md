rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is an interesting
story</a>. Mel Gibson got in trouble for, among other things, claiming
that the Jews run Hollywood. The Jews who run Hollywood did not like Mel
saying they run Hollywood, so they have banned him from Hollywood.
Gibson is now called an anti-Semite because the Jews who run Hollywood
don’t like him. It used to be than an anti-Semite was someone who hated
Jews, but now it is someone who is hated by the Jews, which is why Mel
Gibson in on the blacklist.

Now, the Jews who run Hollywood and the Jews who run the media, claim
that Gibson is blackballed because he is bad for business.  I suspect
most people don’t care about what Gibson thinks about anything. Danny
Glover, for example, is a raging bigot and paranoid lunatic. Susan
Sarandon is probably a schizophrenic. Her former paramour is a
communist. Who is worse? A Holocaust denier or a guy in favor of
murdering people with whom he disagrees?

No one really knows if Gibson is toxic with the public. He could be.
Perhaps the public will not embrace a crazy, drunken anti-Semite. Worse,
they could hold it against the studio that hires him or the actors who
work with him. There are a lot of unknowns and for any business,
unknowns are scary. Even so, the real issue here is the Jews running
Hollywood can’t bring themselves to forgive Gibson. These are a people
whose holy book is mostly a list of past enemies, so Mel will be waiting
a long time.
