John Derbyshire calls the culture war a cold civil war. I like it, even
though it is imperfect. In modern America, we have two groups of white
people. One hates the other with the intensity of a thousand suns. The
other can’t figure it out. That’s means it is less of a civil war than
an occupation. The ruling whites despise the colonized whites or
something like that. <a

Paper of Record is great example.

*More than half the members of the City Council have fired off a letter
to Walmart demanding that it stop making millions in charitable
contributions to local groups here.*

*Twenty-six of the 51 members of the Council charged in the letter that
the world’s biggest retailer’s support of local causes is a cynical ploy
to enter the market here.*

*“We know how desperate you are to find a foothold in New York City to
buy influence and support here,” says the letter, obtained by The Post
and addressed to Walmart and the Walton Family Foundation.*

*“Stop spending your dangerous dollars in our city,” the testy letter
demands. “That’s right: this is a cease-and-desist letter.”*

That can only make sense when you have lost your marbles. These people
hate WalMart so much they will deprive their own people of charity to
make it clear how much they hate WalMart. Why do they hate WalMart? It’s
southern!

*Last week, Walmart announced that it distributed $3 million last year
to charities here, including $1 million to the New York Women’s
Foundation, which offers job training, and $30,000 to Bailey House,
which distributes groceries to low-income residents.*

*Walmart, which has been thwarted by union-backed opposition for more
than a decade, said the handouts “can make a difference on big issues
like hunger relief and career development.”*

*The retail giant said its business agenda “aligns with supporting the
local organizations that are important to our customers and
associates.”*

*But Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito called the donations “toxic
money,” and accused Walmart of waging a “cynical public-relations
campaign that disguises Walmart’s backwards anti-job agenda.”*

There’s a level of crazy that lies beyond the ability to comprehend.
This lunatic is just spitting out all the scare words she can conjure.
There was a time when this sort of behavior disqualified you from public
office – even in New York City.
