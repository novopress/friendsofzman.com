The late great Eric Hohher observed that a mass movement can rise and
spread without belief in a God, but never without belief in a devil.
This is often misread, but what Hoffer had in mind was that the movement
needs an enemy. It can live without a great cause, but it has to have an
enemy. The struggle against evil allows the movement to create its own
origin myth and justify its failures as sacrifices. It is why the
Progressives have been so good at inventing new monsters to slay.
Without monsters, they have no reason to exist.

The modern American Right, in contrast, was never good at inventing
bogeymen, because it was always a Progressive heresy. By that I mean the
Buckleyites eventually came to accept all the assumptions of the
Progressives with regards to the human condition. The difference was
they had a different devil to confront. Theirs was the Red Menace and
the its Soviet sponsors. What kept movement conservatism moving was the
fight against the commies, even when they ceded all the important
philosophical turf to the Progressive.

An example to see this is the <a

target="_blank">recent column by National Review editor Rich Lowry</a>.
National Review is the flagship publication of the American conservative
movement. In theory, at least, they describe the boundaries of what is
and what is not conservative, by defining the principles of modern
conservatism.

Now, Lowry is no one’s idea of a deep thinker so he can be forgiven for
not seeing the the ridiculousness of the highlighted section. If
Progressives have all this moral capital from their past fights over
race, then they are by definition on the right side of history. How
could it be otherwise? That’s the logical end point of Lowry’s assertion
that the Left was on the side of angels in the great moral crusades of
the last two centuries. It would be bizarre for Progressives not to use
such a thing as a weapon. They see it as an obligation.

There’s something else there. Lowry goes out of his way to kowtow to the
Left on the issue of race. What he is doing, even if he does not know
it, is signally his submissiveness to his moral superiors. These are the
words of the loser letting his betters know he is not going to be any
trouble. Lowry is letting his alleged adversaries know that he agrees
with them on the big issues and that there is no need to question his
belief in orthodoxy.

The orthodoxy is the New Religion with its three pillars of
egalitarianism, multiculturalism and anti-racism. The only real quibble
the Official Right has with the people in charge is how to go about
turning the New Religion into public policy. It is probably why they are
obsessed with restarting the Cold War and waging a Crusade against the
Muslims. Official Conservatism™ needs a devil. Otherwise, it becomes
just another school of thought among Progressives.

There’s always been a problem with the New Religion and that is it clams
run head long into objective reality. The sort of spiritual
egalitarianism preached by the intellectual forebears of Progressives
was perfectly sustainable as it was impossible to disprove. The modern
version of it is hilariously absurd. Boys are not the same as girls.
Nature does not bestow her gifts equally and this scales up to group
differences. People tend to notice that the NBA is all black and the
best lawyers have a precious metal in their name.

This is the central issue of our age. Our betters insist that all men
are equal, full stop. Filling up Cologne with Arabs changes nothing
about Cologne because people are the same everywhere and culture is a
myth. Everyone else recognizes this to be dangerous nonsense. Thousands
of generations of evolution have resulted in a planet full of people
with different skills, culture and attitudes. Sweden is the way it is
because it is full of Swedes, instead of Arabs.

The determination of our rulers to stamp out large parts of observable
reality is what is eroding their legitimacy. This is why Official
Conservatism™ has failed. It has no response to the ongoing crisis that
is the inevitable result of the New Religion. It has become a mass
movement afraid of offending anyone, therefore it is left with gooey
platitudes about principles and its role in public life. It’s why it is
difficult to tell the Right from the Left these days. They believe all
the same stuff now.

The great fight that is shaping up is between one side that insists,
despite all the evidence, that all humans are equal in every way. it is
only the differences in culture that result in differences in people.
For our purposes, economics is in the culture bucket. The other side
says man is naturally hierarchical and that groups of humans have unique
attributes suited for where they evolved over thousands of generations.
This means that different people will have different cultures, different
gifts and different liabilities. This is why people naturally
self-segregate.

Observable reality is on the side of the latter.
