week, putting the podcast together, was a bit of a scramble. Each
Sunday, I sit down and clean up my notes for the blog and the podcast. I
keep a running list of stories and ideas that pop into my head. The
stuff I’ve done on the blog or in the podcast gets purged and then I
organize the rest. Most weeks I know what I want to write about for the
week, but I leave open the option to go where events take me.

For the podcast, since it takes some time to record and edit, I try to
get a head start on Sunday and think about what I want to rant about the
following week. I’ll put the Xirl science stuff together, for example,
on Sunday. I may even record it if I’m practicing some editing stuff.
This week, starting on Sunday, I was drawing a blank. Not too much
jumped out to me as worthy topics. It finally came together as a mélange
of items.

My mind naturally wants to have each podcast organized around a theme.
Maybe not every segment, but the bulk of them. It’s an odd tick, but it
is just how my brain is wired. I like order and symmetry. Sometimes that
is not possible, so i just have to accept that the perfect is the enemy
of the good enough. This week, a collection of unrelated items is good
enough, at least I hope it is good enough. Time will tell.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard
format. Spreaker has the full show. I’ll be posting clips on Gab for the
ADD listeners. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android commies can
take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on iTunes, which
means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones. Of
course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never finish.
