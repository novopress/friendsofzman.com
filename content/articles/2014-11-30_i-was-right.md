<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=3280" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">I wrote the other day</a> that the Rolling Stone tale
about a rape victim at the University of Virginia sounded fake. In order
for it to be true requires a whole lot of other things to be true that
are implausible. The most obvious being that a university where
victimology is a mandatory religion would callously suppress stories
about their secret rape culture. It also requires me to believe that
upper-middle class Eloi, who spend their days playing Quidditch, are
barbaric rapist at night. That and the story sounds like a passage from
Lena Dunham psuedo-biography.

It looks like <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve Sailer</a> is on the story now. And
<a
href="http://www.richardbradley.net/shotsinthedark/2014/11/24/is-the-rolling-stone-story-true/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">some guy I never heard of</a> is on the
trail too.

The latter blogger makes some good factual points. He also touches on
what I wrote and that is the Rolling Stone story reads like a bad after
school special. It is what people imagine goes one with their worst
enemies when no one is around to record it. In this case, the rape
culture fanatics in the womyn’s studies program who never get invited to
frat parties. They think all men are rapists, particularly the ones who
never look their way.

I have some familiarity with the University of Virginia. It is one of
the “New Ivies” and that means it is drawing from the upper-middle
classes. The members of the plutocracy that live in Northern Virginia
send their kids there. This is the most fragile of the fragile males for
the most part. I’m talking about the kid of boys that
<a href="http://www.thehoya.com/i-was-mugged-and-i-understand-why/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">write things like this</a>. If anyone is
getting raped in these fraternities, it is the frat brothers.

I’m reminded of the Isaac Asimov novel *Foundation*. The people in
charge figured out how to use religion to control their more powerful
enemies. They turned science into a religion and supplied the “priests”
to administer the “religion” for their neighbors. The point being is
that if you control the magical thoughts all people have in their heads,
you effectively control the people. Today, the magical thinking in most
people’s heads has to do with keeping the pale penis people from
rampaging through the vulnerable. The Cult through its cadre of priests
is there to protect blacks, young women, foreigners, etc.
