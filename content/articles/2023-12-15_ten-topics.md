The final show of the year is a scramble of topics that turned up in the
e-mail either by nature or upon request. There were others that were
either not interesting to me, or they were of a more personal nature. I
do not want to go down the road of offering advice to people, so I tend
to avoid those topics. There is never an upside to giving advice,
especially personal advice, so it is best to avoid it.

The one topic I could have gone on longer about is the Covid stuff,
which I have not done in a long time. It is a good example of how the
media’s real power is the power to ignore a subject or person. They
flipped the switch on Covid and slowly people just forgot about the
whole thing. The only people who want to talk about it are the people
who were right about it or have a complaint about it.

This is especially powerful when the regime makes an error. The vaccine
stuff was a terrible blunder, but the media ignore it, so it does not
get discussed. Poor Ron DeSantis thought Covid would be a great card to
play, but in these debates, he never gets asked about it and he has
stopped mentioning it. That means if Trump remains on the ballot for
2024, he will not be asked about his role in the fiasco.

The thing is the media does not do this consciously. They exist in a
small, isolated world unaware of the outer world. What is important to
them is assumed to be important to everyone and vice versa. Once Covid
stopped being a big deal to them, the dogs barked, and the media caravan
moved on. We are seeing the same thing with Biden impeachment, which is
of no interest to them at the moment.

An amusing example is the Cobra holding a town hall meeting
[moderated](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/12/14/january-6-vivek-ramaswamy-cnn-town-hall-vpx.cnn)
by a carny on CNN the other day. The carny demanded proof that the FBI
was involved in January 6, as if this was a crazy suggestion. The carny
was unaware of the mountain of stories about the FBI role in the event,
because in her world there is only one version of that day, and no one
ever thinks to question it.

That is what will make the Ukraine story interesting in 2024. Few in the
media are aware of what has really been happening. That means over the
next six months they will have to be brought up to speed by the few
people who have some clue and will be allowed to talk about reality. It
will be like seeing a colony of mole people see the sunshine for the
first time. Good times will be had by all.
