I always get a kick out of
<a href="http://mic.com/brain/map-your-mind/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">these things</a> because they are mostly bullshit. If
you go through the questions, they tell you the combination of famous
people you most resemble. None of the famous people are monsters or
evil. The idea is to flatter the user, not horrify them. Still, I’d be
tempted to have results that said the user had a brain like Hitler or
Jack the Ripper, but I’d be a terrible astrologer. Here is my result:

*Leonardo of Arc*  
*You have an active imagination and free-spirited side, which means you
dream big, believe anything can happen, and are open to new experiences
that might present opportunities to learn and explore. You get these
traits from Leonardo da Vinci, the genius artist, inventor and
mathematician whose talent is still considered to be one of the greatest
in the world.*

*But you’re also very disciplined, and have a strong work ethic that
grounds your personality and gives all your big dreams and ideas the
fuel to become reality. You get these traits from Joan of Arc, the bold,
fearless French heroine who was also canonized as a Catholic saint.*

Joan of Arc was probably a schizophrenic. She had “visions” and heard
voices. There’s some speculation that she faked it and was some sort of
a con-artist, but grifters don’t take their con so far that they get
burned at the stake. Modern feminists have made her a heroine of their
cause so that’s probably why the site used her in its rotation. I took
the test a few more times and got different results each time so they
may be using a random personality generator.

The IQ crowd puts a lot of stock in these sorts of profiles. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Big Five</a> personality traits are the
gold standard.
<a href="http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">You can take the self-exam</a> here if you’re
interested. I’ve given a lot of these types of exams in the past and I
know a lot of companies that use them for management development. The
military academies used to administer them, but I don’t know if that is
still the case. At the academies, testing for leadership is of obvious
value so they do a lot of it.

There’s a lot of good science behind it, but I’m not 100% sold. The
reason I’ve always been a bit skeptical is I’ve taken these things and
it is not hard to figure out the point of the questions. I’ve been able
to game the test to get the result I wanted so I’m sure more devious
minded people can do it with no problem. Then there is the fact people
tend to lie on self-assessments. That said, I’ve been tested a lot so
I’m probably not a great example. I also like reverse engineering these
tests so I probably notice the patterns more readily that others.

Regardless, the Internet says I’m an artistic schizophrenic or a highly
disciplined French heroine.
