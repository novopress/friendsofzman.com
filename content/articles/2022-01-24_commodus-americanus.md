**Note:** The Monday <a
href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-madonna-of-modern-politics/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. Not related to the
topic of the day, but a topic that is I pray Allah will make more
important every day. The
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/518735" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday podcast</a> is up behind the green door and it is
mostly about the moral crisis of this age.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an old expression, “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three
generations”, that has haunted powerful people since forever. A
variation on this is “The first generation makes it. The second
generation maintains it and the third generation blows it”. While not an
iron law of the universe, it is an observation that has held up over
time. Whether it is business empires or political empires, the work of
the great man somehow turns into a curse that plagues the lives of his
descendents.

The funny thing about this bit of reality is that it is well known and
many very smart people have tried to come up with a solution, but the
problem remains. In the business world, expert planners work with
business owners to help them mitigate this disaster, but only about 10%
of family business make it to the grandchildren. The trust system was
designed with this in mind. The grandchildren will never amount to much,
but at least they will have an allowance to sustain them.

It is fair to say that popular forms of government were invented to
address the problem of private rule going sour by the third generation.
Caesar Augustus was the great founder of the empire. Tiberius Caesar
Augustus was solid, but he suffered from the predictable maladies of
every second generation ruler. Caligula is arguably Rome’s most famous
lunatic. Of course, we have Claudius, an interregnum of sorts, before we
get to Nero, who was literally the end of the line.

The promise of popular government is the elites are in a competition
with one another to run the society. The people get to pick the winner,
based on their interests. This way the great man does not hand control
over to his disinterested son and his disinterested son does not leave
things to a maniac. Every generation gets to figure out who is the most
fit to rule society. The theory takes the natural hierarchy of society
and allows it to keep renewing itself through merit. That is the theory.

Reality seems to be that old adage at the start. We see this with the
current ruling classes of the West. They are looking like Commodus, the
heir to the great Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, the last of the five
good emperors. Unlike his father, Commodus was much more interested in
spectacle and what we would today call bourgeoise degeneracy. It was his
excessive self-indulgences and reckless disregard for order that brought
an end to the Pax Romana.

Commodus is a good emperor to study when thinking about what is
happening with the managerial elite of the American empire. When you
look around at this elite, you see a lot of people like Commodus. They
were born into privilege, dotted on by parents who dreamed big dreams
for them. They came into the world expecting the world to comport to
their desires. Most important, you see that appropriation of authority
that was never earned, but passed down from the prior generation.

The news currently tells us that we are on the brink of war with Russia
over Ukraine and one of the best minds on the job for the Biden team is
[Jake Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan). There is
nothing in his resume that says he should be running a hot dog stand,
but he has been told his whole life he is fit to rule, so he believes
it. [Victoria Nulland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Nuland) is
another member of the foreign policy brain trust. Her career is best
described as one disaster after another, but she was born for the role
in every sense.

Look around at the elected class and you see the same pattern. There are
no men who went from the middle class to elected office on their own
merit. In fact, it is hard to find anyone in national politics who has
ever had a job. No one in the leadership of both parties has a line for
“private sector” in his resume. The reason for that is they have never
done productive work. Instead, like our old friend Commodus, they were
groomed from birth to take up positions in the ruling class.

Taken as a whole, the Commodus comparison becomes clear. Marcus Aurelius
never would have set foot in the Coliseum, but his feckless son thought
himself as Rome’s first entertainer, so he spent a lot of time
performing. Our current ruling class looks more like carny folk than the
men who built the empire. This is where you see the other comparison to
Commodus. Like the doomed emperor, our ruling class cannot stop
indulging its increasingly deranged whims.

Historical analogies are never perfect. They only serve as a starting
point for understanding the present or the past. One is the fixed
understanding while the other side of the analogy is the thing you want
to analyze. We know what we need to know about Commodus and many other
men like him. He is a familiar type in history because he was part of
that long observed phenomenon at the start. This observation was
famously applied to civilizations by Oswald Spengler.

What this suggest about the current age is that there is not much that
can be done to arrest this cycle once it has begun. The transformation
of the American republic into an empire in the 19th century, despite
maintaining the republican pretentions, meant that this period was as
inevitable as the seasons. That old republican competition was replaced
by an imperial selection system, which inevitably results in a
generation more interested in being elite than doing the work of an
elite.

The question, of course, is what comes next. Rome never returned to its
republican nature, but centuries of empire erased it from the collective
memory. Depending upon how you mark the beginning, the American empire
has been around for no more than a century and less than half that if
you use the Cold War as the beginning. Further, most people in the
empire think popular government is the only moral choice. In this way,
America is more like Athens than Rome.

Again, Commodus may provide some short term answers. Once he proclaimed
himself a living god and renamed the city *Colonia Lucia Annia
Commodiana,* it became clear he had to go, so he was assassinated. This
set off a power struggle, a period known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Year of Five Emperors</a>. Septimius
Severus was eventually able to defeat the various factions and claim
control of the empire. The Severin dynasty was short-lived, however, and
was followed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Crisis of the Third Century</a>.

In other words, the correction to the generational decline was a
housecleaning of the elite in a period of turmoil. If you date the start
of the American empire to Gettysburg, then this means a series of crisis
until North American returns to its natural divisions that have been
there since the Founding. If you date the empire to the middle of the
last century, then maybe the end is a return to mid-century normalcy.
Regardless of your preferred future, all paths lead through a crisis.
