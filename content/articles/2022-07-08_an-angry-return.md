One of the strange things about the mass media age is that you stop
noticing the awfulness after a while. Lots of people have taken a break
from watching sportsball, for example, and then found they could not go
back. When they tried to watch a game or show related to the game, they
suddenly found it intolerably stupid. The same thing happens with the
infotainment side. Once you take a break from it, the stupidity jumps
off the screen when you return to it.

The last week of June and most of this week I have been tackling some
changes in my daily routine. As a result, I have been unplugged from the
new cycle. Normally, I check a dozen main sites every morning. Every
Sunday there is a news show behind the green door. I also try to catch
the opening of Tucker most nights. The last two weeks I have done little
of that due to time constraints. That and change can be tiring so when I
had some free time I just relaxed.

This week I wanted to do a casual show so that means going through the
news items and commenting upon them. My goodness. The short time away
was enough to break the spell it seems. The ridiculousness of the people
on these mass media platforms takes over the screen. The over the top
language, the exaggeration and the paranoia is intolerably ridiculous.
Going through the various news sites my *myötähäpeä* was pegged at
eleven the entire time.

A while back I did a Taki post on the macaroni men. This was a fad in
the 18th century in which men would dress like clowns in public. The
only thing is their absurd costumes were not intended to be funny. These
were serious people and their ridiculous outfits were proof of their
seriousness. The same thing exists now. Instead of silly hats, the Cloud
People don silly ideas. They decorate themselves with overwrought
opinions about small things made up to be important.

Of course, the absurdity of it all reflects the absurdity of the people
behind it and to a great degree the target audience. The mass media is
created by flakes and weirdos for people who want to be like them. The
days of a newspaper seeking to inform the readers about the events of
the day are long gone. Cable chat shows are just the modern freak show
and animal act. Out mass media is an essential part of a ridiculous
system run by ridiculous people.
