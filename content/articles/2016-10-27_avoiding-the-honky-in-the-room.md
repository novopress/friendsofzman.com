The NBA season has kicked off this week and if you are a white guy, you
most likely don’t care all that much. That’s not to say that no white
people follow the NBA. It’s just that basketball, particularly the NBA,
is the sport for black people. My guess is 90% of black people would
list the NBA as their favorite sport, while 90% of whites would have the
NBA down on the list or not on the list. One reason for that is the
league is dominated by black guys.

ground in the modern NBA.

Unsaid here is the fact that the stars of the league are all black. The
last prominent honky was Dirk Nowitzki. Before that, it was Larry
Bird. Before that it was John Havlicek in the 70’s. In my lifetime I can
count the white stars of the NBA on one hand so it is reasonable to say
that the league has been dominated by the brothas since forever. Despite
all the preaching and browbeating from our rulers, everyone knows that
basketball is the black man’s game.

target="_blank">Like a lot of reality, though</a>, it remains unsaid.

The first bit of unintended humor in the piece is when the writer asks
the honkies what they learned about black culture as tokens in the black
man’s world.

> “I like hip-hop, yeah.”

> “I like to listen to hip-hop”
>
> “I have definitely picked up on slang, music and food”
>
> “I listen to more rap, hip-hop in the locker room.”

Not a word about peanut butter.

Anyway, the truly hilarious part is when the writer asked the honkies
why there are so few white guys in the NBA. J. J. Redick’s answer
suggests he had a mild stroke when asked the question:

The rest of the answers from the other players range from gibberish to
some version of “Please God let this end before I say something stupid.”
You can’t blame them for it as the surest way for a white guy to end up
in a public struggle session is to talk about race. The one guy, who
said what everyone knows is true, is some guy named Parsons. He said,
“The NBA is a collection of some of the most athletic guys in the world.
And white guys just aren’t that athletic.”  Yep, there’s the answer.

The NBA altered the rules of their game over the years to make it a
running and jumping sport. Whether or not this was intended to make it a
black guy sport is hard to say, but given
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=7805" target="_blank">the
demographics of the league’s ownership</a>, it is a safe assumption.
This is also a league that embraced gangster rap and the hip-hop
lifestyle in the 90’s so it is fair to assume they really want to be a
black league, except for the ticket base, which remains conspicuously
white. Going to an NBA game for these people is an act of contrition.

The lunacy of the modern age is on full display here. Baseball get grief
because the makeup of their players matches up pretty well with America.
About 13% of baseball players are black. There are loads of Hispanics,
both local and foreign, as well as Asian players. Even the management
positions have long looked like America, in terms of racial makeup. The
NBA is nothing like the demographics of America and it is celebrated as
a model of diversity. In modern America, <a

How long people refuse to notice this is the question of our age.
