Political and social trends are looking more and more like weird cults
that people join for a short while and then abandon for some new
crackpot thing. Just a few years ago the comments sections of websites
were filled with nutters ranting about the glories of sodomite marriage.
Then, the sodomites were thrown out of the temple and trannies were the
new thing.

Anti-racism is looking like one of those trends that may have a long
shelf life. <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/05/22/is-anti-white-bias-a-problem/jockeying-for-stigma"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">I saw this</a> in the NYTimes. If you
look at the comments, you can see why it is so intoxicating to the
lunatics on the Left. This comment from a kook named Tim C is
emblematic:

*I literally do not find “anti-white” bias and “reverse racism” valid
concepts. Race is a concept no one in America do not want to discuss.
And by that, I mean, white Americans. Rather than have an intellectual
proactive discussion that produces proactive solutions that push social
progress, all we do is point blame at the victims and do not think to
comprehend why white America aggresses without responsibility. We cannot
be post-racial when we have not even been racial.*

Those sentences are barely English – literally! But, you can bet he felt
great after having typed them. He got to bang on publicly about the pale
penis people, thus showing his piety. That’s the thing about
anti-racism. it’s hard to mock someone for it. Start yammering about
trannies or even sodomites and people will snicker.

In many respects, anti-racism is the perfect topic for the Cultural
Marxist. The pale penis people will always be with us so there is no
“winning” or end game like we had with homosexual marriage. Since blacks
will also always be with us, the disparities are a social constant.

The key to these modern movements is that the promised land must be just
over the next hill. That way, the believers can feel their are getting
closer so they get worked up in a frenzy at anything that is seen as an
obstacle. As the Greeks learned in the Peloponnesian War, fanaticism
comes easy when the enemy is evil.

Sailer think the whole enterprise is coming apart, but I don’t know.
Hatred of the pale penis people has psychic rewards that can’t be easily
replaced. Even homosexuals get tired of being around homosexuals so
having the gay friend gets old quickly. Being anti-white, even if you’re
white, is all upside and no downside. It’s like heroin that helps you
work harder and be more conscientious, as well as be in a perpetual
dream state.

Just scan through those comments. They are clawing each others eyes out
to get to the top of the piety pole. They are rats hooked on coke
banging at the little button to get their next fix. That does not go
away without something filling the void.
