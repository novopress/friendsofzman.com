Way back in the olden thymes I lived near a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness#Preaching_activities"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hari Kirsihna</a> center.
Despite their reputation for extreme weirdness, they were excellent
neighbors. You only saw members when they were headed out to annoy
people in a public place. That is one of their primary methods of
spreading their faith. They make a big fuss in a public area, hoping
someone will find it interesting. They really do seek out people who
have run out of options, as far as participating in a social group.

Otherwise, they kept to themselves and avoided all contact with
neighbors. A key characteristic of cults is the adherent’s “us” versus
“them” view of the world. Everyone and everything is either inside or
outside the group. In the case of groups like the Krishnas, that results
in complete isolation from outsiders. As far as they were concerned, the
neighbors did not exist and that was the way they wanted it.

We tend to think of cults as having a charismatic. That leader has some
grand vision of the future. Maybe it involves space aliens or God. Maybe
he thinks he is God. Of course, the cult of popular imagination always
follows the same arc. The leader acquires some followers and it all
seems innocent and wonderful. The thing grows as the leader becomes
increasingly deranged. At some point he either leads them into
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass suicide</a> or into some
crazy act that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Davidians"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brings the whole thing
down</a>.

As we see with the Krishnas and Scientology, obliteration is not the
outcome in all cases or even most cases. The guy who started the Hari
Krishnas has been dead for years and his movement keeps going.
Scientology thrived after the death of L. Ron Hubbard. As far as I know,
neither is plotting mass suicide or trying to launch a revolution.

The famous UFO cult,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seekers_%28Chicago%29"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Seekers</a>, fell apart,
reformed a few times until Dorothy Martin died. The point being that
cults and religious movements don’t always end in obliteration. In fact,
most either stabilize into a viable ongoing concern or they fall apart
and the followers find a new movement. Those that survive their founders
tend to get good at drawing bright lines between themselves and everyone
else.

I was reminded of all that when <a
href="http://phys.org/news/2014-06-obedient-agreeable-liberal-counterparts.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I saw this posted on MR the
other day</a>. On a regular basis, a gaggle of social scientists release
a study telling us why liberals are good and conservatives are bad.
Sometimes it is just a focus on why conservatives are bad and other
times it is a study on some essential goodness of liberals. The point is
always the same, as the people doing it are always the same.

The gold standard for this, oddly enough, led to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Goldwater Rule</a>. In 1964 a
bunch of liberal psychiatrists, during the 1964 presidential campaign,
declared that Barry Goldwater was clinically insane. After all, only a
crazy person would deny the essential goodness of the Progressive
movement. Some version of this pops up every few years, masked as social
science.

An obsession with the moral differences between “us” and “them” is a
hallmark of mass movements. It is fair to say they are fanatical about
it. Oddly and maybe even counter intuitively, members of mass movements
are not very good at understanding the differences between the array of
groups not in *their* group. The others are just an undifferentiated
mass of people not inside the cult.

A good example is the Amish. As far as they’re concerned, everyone else
is English, by which they mean outsiders. They could no more tell a
Catholic from a Jew and they don’t care. Muslims see nothing but
infidels outside the world of Islam. Scientology, from what I
understand, has similar labels for people outside their faith. Jews call
non-Jews gentiles and, oddly, Mormons call non-Mormons gentiles too.

Progressives are by any reasonable definition, a political cult. Like
Islam, it is aggressive and intolerant, particularly of Christianity.
Not unreasonably, it sees Christianity as its chief threat. Not that
Christians are automatically a bunch of freedom loving Burkeans. The
Pope, after all, is a Marxist. That does not matter to the Left. They
have a long hatred for Christians and Christianity.

The mandates in ObamaCare were not put in for health or cost reasons.
Their intent was to make life miserable for Christians because they
oppose contraception and abortion. That’s why Progressives have gone
berserk over the Hobby Lobby case. If you imagine yourself in a life and
death struggle with your chief rival, even tiny set backs seem like the
end of the world.

I’ll wrap this rambling post up with a short story about an Iranian I
once knew. This was back in the Iran – Iraq War days. He had been
drafted into the Ayatollah’s army and sent to fight the Iraqis. A
commander called for volunteers to clear a minefield. Immediately a
bunch of young fanatics volunteered. They were sent out into the
minefield, finding the mines the old fashioned way. Behind them the
infantry, followed the now clear path through the field.

Shortly thereafter my Iranian friend went AWOL, got a fake student Visa
and found his way to Belgium. He hooked up with other Iranian ex-pats,
mostly Christians and Jews. They helped him get his paperwork in order.
Because of the chaos in Iran at the time, his parents were able to claim
he was missing in action so they could avoid trouble from the fanatics.

That’s life in a land where a cult takes over.
