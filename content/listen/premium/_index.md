    title="Sunday Thoughts August 07, 2022"
    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday. <br/><br/>Not much happening in the news this week and I did a news show on Friday, so I thought this week I would talk about something else. I have been spending time thinking about the various cults that haunt the current age. I did a Taki post on the cult of Gaia last week. I have talked about the neocons as a cult and may do a post on the topic at some point. There are other cults out there, as well as ad hoc cults that form up around news events. The Russian collusion hoax is a good example.<br/><br/>I had a bunch of tabs open to neocon stuff so after seeing that the news was dry, I figured thirty minutes of talking about the cult of neoconservatism might be a good way to pass the time on a lazy summer Sunday. The thing I keep circling back to with these people is how they are feverishly reworking their thing to ingratiate themselves with the Left, which they see as a new host. It suggests coordination, but is this just instinct at work or are they sitting around plotting this stuff?<br/><br/>I tend to lean toward the former. This is due to spending most of my life in and around large organization and seeing them drift off course. In the corporate world you see a lot of careful planning that ends up nowhere near where the planners expected. After a while you start to think of the best laid plans as a man in a boat fighting the current to reach the shore. Often, the man makes the shore, but not exactly where he expected. Sometimes he is just swept down the river and forgotten. <br/><br/>My sense with the neocons is they viscerally reacted to Trump’s nativism because they grew up in households equating populism and nativism with fascism. That and you know who has become something of a demigod in the secular faith of these people. The chants of “never again” are a reminder to them that it will happen again and this time they must be prepared this time to avoid you know what. Trump triggers this subconscious programming leading them down the river to the cult of Never Trump!<br/><br/>The problem is it disconnected them from their host. They need a host so they are searching around for a suitable replacement onto which to attach their thing. This is why they are increasing hysterical in the way we associate with the far-left. A Jennifer Rubin post is a form of echolalic babbling as she tries to emulate what she hears from the new host. It is not front brain thinking. This is instinct. Her limbic system is pushing her to this new host and she is trying to find cover in it by emulating it.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>•	Jennifer Rubin<br/><br/>•	The Bulwark<br/><br/>•	Jonathan Last<br/><br/>•	A. B. Stoddard<br/><br/>•	Charlie Sykes<br/><br/>•	Cathy Young<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday. <br/><br/>August is typically the slowest time of the year for Washington. Congress is on break and the President is traveling or on vacation. Traditionally, August was a good time to send the President on a world tour as it got him away from the American media. The host countries make sure to select only cooperative reporters to ask the President questions. These days with the American media operating as a public relations firm for the political establishment, Biden does not have that issue. <br/><br/>Even so, it is a rest period for the fall run into the midterms. It is the one time of year when Washington is a pleasant city. That is another reason to suspect that this raid on Mar-a-Lago caper was not run out of the administration and instead was done by others. The mad scramble to get important figureheads like Garland back into the city and provide them with a script suggests they were unprepared. The media was also caught off-guard so they did not have their narrative ready. <br/><br/>It is easy to forget, but the FBI spying caper was mostly run by junior members. It is clear now that the Obama people did not know what was happening until that kooky CIA director gave them a cock and bull story about it near the end of their time. They knew he was lying, which is why they wrote memos to themselves to that effect, so they could avoid getting caught up in it. The people in charge are not the people in charge. That is the problem, no one is in charge so it is a free-for-all.<br/><br/>That is one of those small signs that suggest we may be closer to the end the American empire than we realize. If the deep state were really in control or the alleged leaders were on top of things, these capers would not be happening with increasing frequency. The war against Russia, sending Pelosi to Taiwan and this Trump caper look to me like a system in crisis, rather than control. People in the system are doing what they want because they have no dear from the top. Behind closed doors, it is chaos.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday.<br/><br/>As expected, the news is picking up after the unofficial end of summer. One of the challenges about this time of year, especially with an election looming, is getting back into the swing of reading the news. It is as if the firehose has been turned on full blast all of a sudden. With so much of it entirely fake, it feels like that scene in Star Trek, The Next Generation where Picard is being tortured.  Reading the regime news sites I keep expecting a voice to shout, “How many lights?!”<br/><br/>I must admit that the thought of buying a piece of land off-grid and dropping out of society entirely comes to mind at these times. There are a bunch of YouTube channels dedicated to off-grid living that I have recently discovered. I guess this has been a thing for a while. Like everything in this age, most of them are fake, but some are legitimate. There is a natural appeal to the thought of chucking it all and “to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.”<br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe next week the show will be from a hut in the forest.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Ukraine Media War <br/><br/>·         California Dreamin’ <br/><br/>·         China Syndrome <br/><br/>·         Ingrates <br/><br/>·         Managerialism <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday.<br/><br/>I must admit that I have enjoyed the bleep show DeSantis started when he shipped migrants to Martha’s Vineyard last week. Intentional or not, it was perfect timing as this is the off-season when the beautiful people are now gone. That left the locals who are every bit as pompous and self-righteous, but not as well trained as the professional sociopaths. That made for some excellent video as these ridiculous hypocrites struggled to deal with the story.<br/><br/>The hope is that this is not a one time deal. Keep doing it but pick different locations so a new group of pompous jerks have to figure out how to moon for the cameras. It is a form of “bringing the war home” when you think about it. As long as these smug people avoid the consequences, they can carry on pretending they are on the moral high ground. It is what the antiwar people proposed doing during the Vietnam war, but without the violence.<br/><br/>The big difference is the radicals of the 1960’s were dealing with fundamentally decent people who were trying to do the right thing. Our present rulers are fundamentally indecent people who will use this stunt as a reason to go harder on the normal people. The people in charge, the leadership of both parties, corporate America, Silicon Valley and Hollywood, are organized around hating white people and nothing will change their minds.<br/><br/>Still, it was a fun show.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Get Getz <br/><br/>·         Super Butthurt   <br/><br/>·         Surreal Means Stupid <br/><br/>·         Campfire Stories  <br/><br/>·         Trump Judges   <br/><br/>·         Danger To Our Hypocrisy <br/><br/>·         Bhad Bhabie <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Sunday Thoughts September 25 2022"
    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday.<br/><br/>Most of the show this week is on the new Republican plan to save America! They are calling it their “Commitment to America” which suggests there is some question about their commitment, but no one will mention that to them. The plan is a collection of vague promises cooked up by lobbying groups. You can also see the fingerprints of regime pollsters whose job is to make sure the pols never mention anything popular with people.<br/><br/>That is one of the things about the system that no one notices. The consultants and pollsters take the long view of their business. That long view says the party is eternal, while the politicians are just temporary glimmers flashing across the screen. That means the consultants give their clients advice that pleases the party. That way, the party recommends them the next cycle. The same applies to pollsters who only poll on issues popular with the party.<br/><br/>When the lobbyists presented their “Commitment to America” scheme to the House GOP, they fortified with a slew of “social media experts” and polling. The experts claimed that immigration remains popular, but illegal immigration is unpopular. The term “energy independence” polled well, so that is in the plan at various places. There was no polling done on the plan to force people into electric cars or make them eat burgers made from bugs.<br/><br/>You have to be mindful of your own bias, so maybe I am missing the appeal here, but this feels like a half-assed bit of nostalgia for the 1990’s. Looking through the site, it felt like the people behind it were doing it because they had to do something. In fact, neither side of the regime is bothering to say why anyone should vote for them. If our elections were honest, the ballot would have “More of the Same” and the “Even More of the Same” as the two choices.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe I am the one divorced from reality and this stuff electrifies normie. Come election day there will be mile long lines of grillers eager to vote for More of the Same or maybe it is Even More of the Same. On the other hand, maybe everyone has just accepted that these are the choices in the two party system and playing along is better than complaining about it. You always have to leave open the possibility that you are the crazy person in the room.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         The Commitment to Nothing <br/><br/>·         The Blackety-black <br/><br/>·         Violent Trotskyites <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday.<br/><br/>A big and important power of the media is the power to ignore. This is evident in the terrorist attack on the European gas lines last week. There were news stories, but nowhere near the volume one would expect from such a thing. There were no narratives posted by the usual suspects. Compare the coverage of the storm to the coverage of the bombing. The former is just weather porn, the latter is one of the most important geopolitical events in our lifetime.<br/><br/>Tucker talked about it last week in one of his monologues. It is as if the usual suspects in the media have been waiting for the scripts to arrive. They do not know what to say because they have not been told what to say and there is no obvious narrative structure.  You cannot blame it on the bad guys as that is too ridiculous even for this age. There can be no good guys here as blowing up civilian infrastructure is always considered a bad thing. The only solution is to ignore it.<br/><br/>This may turn out to be a critical event. The practical impact is hard to know. There are two other pipelines bringing gas into Europe. Maybe that will be enough to survive winter. One of them goes through Ukraine, so that is a concern. The bigger issue is the moral one. Washington just squandered all of its moral capital on this caper. You cannot be seen as the good guy when you are blowing up civilian infrastructure on allied territory. There is no way to ignore that reality.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Fake Russia News <br/><br/>·         The Usual Suspects <br/><br/>·         Fake Russia News #2 <br/><br/>·         More Crying Out  <br/><br/>·         Girl Power  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday.<br/><br/>Quick Note: There is some clicking in parts of the show that I could not clean up. I am not sure where it is coming from and I could not figure out how to strip them from the recording. I have to upgrade my software, apparently, in order to have that tool.<br/><br/>Way back during Covid I wondered out loud a few times how the regime media would walk back the things they were saying that were obviously untrue. It feels like a million years ago, but they were sure we had two weeks to bend the curve. They were sure that we were facing a long dark winter of a pandemic of the unvaccinated. None of that was true, but they just moved on like it never happened and all of it has been forgotten. It really is remarkable.<br/><br/>In fairness, there are people on-line who have not forgotten. They are the ones talking about the healthy people keeling over dead for no reason. These are the disinformation merchants in league with Putin and Trump. What sort of impact this has had on society is hard to gauge. Lying is not a cost free enterprise for any ruling class, so it seems like it should have had some consequences. Maybe it has and it is all under the surface, slowly building pressure.<br/><br/>I have had similar thoughts about the Russia business. There are a lot of people who think the Ukrainians are ready to march on Moscow. They think Putin is about to be arrested and executed any day for being Hitler. The bridge story is a good example. They accepted without question that the most important bridge in the world was destroyed by Ukraine. The last few years has been a population-wide study of the Gell-Man amnesia effect.<br/><br/>I wonder what happens when winter comes. The Russians are planning a winter offensive and they have been doing so since the summer. They are committing a lot of resources to it. There was never a question about who was going to win in this war when it started. The question was whether it would end at the negotiating table or on the battlefield. How is the regime media going to walk back all of the things they have been saying for months?<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Russia Russia Russia!<br/><br/>·         Kanye, My Brotha<br/><br/>·         MBS Is Corn Pop<br/><br/>·         Election Stuff<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday. <br/><br/>I thought at this point I would be doing more election stuff, but the media seems to be much lighter on this stuff than I expected. I figured by now it would be wall-to-wall conspiracy theories about how the invisible army of fascists were plotting to steal our democracy! Those would be followed with waves of heroic tales of how brave drones from the uniparty are fighting to save our democracy. Instead, it is still fairly light, as if the narrative machine has broken down.<br/><br/>It could be the terrible polling that the uniparty has, but never releases. Since all of the polling companies compete for contracts from uniparty candidates, they have two sets of books, one for the rubes and one for the insiders. The polling we get to see says the uniparty is going to have a bad time of it next month. That probably means the secret polls are even worse. As a result, they are buckling up to explain the result in a way that works for the party.<br/><br/>There is also the economic stuff. That is not getting anywhere near the attention that it warrants, but in this case, I think it is due to narrative collapse. Back in the summer they were all running with the official story that inflation was transitory. It was a carry over from Covid and the insurrection. They always get high off their own supply, so they were sure by now the economy would be booming. Now they have no idea how to respond to the disconfirmation.<br/><br/>I think we are on the cusp of interesting times. It feels like a lot of things are coming to a head at the same time. There is the economy, which may be worse than is known. Then you have the political crisis looming over Biden’s mental condition. You have Europe teetering on the edge collapse. The Ukraine war is headed for a new, much more lethal phase. Throw in the pending arrest of Donald Trump and we could be in for some very hairy times. <br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         More Trump Horn<br/><br/>·         Russia Russia Russia!<br/><br/>·         Elections<br/><br/>·         Haiti<br/><br/>·         The Rent Is Too Damned High<br/><br/>·         The Usual Suspects<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Like most people, I assumed the Covid lunacy had finally come to an end, but it turns out that the Covidians were simply in hibernation. Yesterday I had to take one of my animals to the vet and I learned that they are back to Covid theater. The masks were back and everyone has to stay outside and wait to be called into the facility. I was tempted to give one of them the business about it, but I ha da sick animal and that was my priority. I will need a new vet it seems.<br/><br/>I have noticed a slight uptick in mask wearing, but I did not think about it. The trip to the vet made me more observant and sure enough there are more masks now. I suspect that once the election is done, we will get a new surge in panic porn from the media. This will be a way for these people to mourn the election without admitting it to themselves. They will hunker down behind their mask as a way to hide from the world that they see as increasingly hostile.<br/><br/>The amusing bit at the vet was that they are not requiring patients to wear the mask. They have a big sign that lectures you about the safety of mask wearing. Two on my way to the examination room once of the Covidians offered me a mask, but I politely declined. I was waiting for one of them to crank-splain the benefits of mask wearing, but it never happened. For now, they are satisfied for a smug, condescending look when a normal person goes bare face.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         The Slaughter Of Twitter<br/><br/>·         Pelosi & The Rough Trade<br/><br/>·         British Shenanigans<br/><br/>·         It’s A Black Thing<br/><br/>·         The Covidians<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="First a quick note. I have upgraded my recording software and now things are not working the way I expected, so bear with me while I sort the issues. The volume seems to be far too low, so you may have to crank the volume depending on your device. There is a noise creeping in that sounds like a chair squeaking but my chair does not squeak. The mic is picking up something, but I cannot figure out the source or how to remove it. One day, I will get a real studio.<br/><br/>Now, this is the most glorious day of the year. You get up and learn that you were suddenly granted an extra hour of life. They moved the clocks back! It used to be that we humans had to move the clocks back, but now the gremlins in our devices magically do it for us. It is as if the gods suddenly granted us a gift for reasons we cannot understand. All joking aside, I love this time of year. I think we should move the clocks back two hours. That would mean moving the clocks ahead two hours in summer.<br/><br/>Adding to the joy is watching the usual suspects blow themselves to pieces over the black entertainers wandering off the reservation. The treatment of the NBA player is particularly sadistic. They are going to force him to publicly admit that the movie he tweeted is anti-Semitic and that he condemns it and everyone involved with it. My goodness.

    desc="I must admit I have mixed feelings on the election. My head tells me the ongoing theft of key races is ultimately in our best interests. Before last week, there were X number of people who thought the system was rigged. Now there is some multiple of X wo at least think there is a problem. I know normies who were skeptical about the vote rigging claims in 2020 but now shrug and laugh about it. The election of brain damaged hobo in Pennsylvania has been clarifying.<br/><br/>I am not as familiar with Arizona, but the few clips I saw of the women running against Kari Lake tells me people there are having the same response. The woman refused to debate and came off as mildly retarded, but maybe she just knew the votes were counted before they were cast. Regardless, there is no way you can accept the result at face value. Throw in the “late arriving votes” that keep magically appearing and you cannot help but question the system.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the regime made a huge error in promoting a collection of absurd candidates in this election, especially after the last election. Normal people are left with two options. They can accept that the majority of the voters are so stupid that they will vote for a ridiculous option like brain damaged hobo or they can think the system is rigged. In fact, they can accept both to some degree, which is probably the worst result for the “our democracy” crowd.<br/><br/>That said, I cannot help but feel a twinge of sadness. Even the most cynical person holds out some hope that disaster can be avoided. The willingness of the regime to put John Fetterman in the Senate says there is no hope for reform. The sanguine attitude of the Republicans says they are in on it. The warning shot that was 2016 has resulted in both parties quietly closing the door on the election process. There will never be another fair election.

I think tomorrow I will do a post about the increasing strangeness of the travel experience. My trip was full of delays and snafus, even though the airports were not all that full for the weekend before a holiday. It was all human error.

    desc="I have to say that I am only mildly looking forward to the great Twitter resurrection that Musk has promised this coming week. It has been so long since I have had an account, I no longer recall the details, like the e-mail I used or the handle. I think I was The_Z_Blog. I seem to recall that having been taken so I think I had to be something else, but who knows? I long ago deactivated the e-mail associated with it and I do not think I ever supplied a mobile number.<br/><br/>That means if Musk resurrects my account, I will never know about it. I am okay with that as I was never a big fan of Twitter. I have about a dozen accounts bookmarked that I look at during the day, so I expect no changes. Those bookmarked accounts will supply the necessary zaniness from the great resurrection. Of course, that assumes there is a race back to the platform by the millions of banned accounts. I bet many are like me and never return.<br/><br/>That said, it is amusing to see a billionaire dunking on the various scolds and crybabies that are now in a panic over the lack of moderation. I am told many of them signed up for Mastodon accounts only to find that there is no moderation there. They keep reporting people and now the mods there are banning these people for reporting people for mean speech. It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at it.

    desc="Watching the Twitter drama, I am reminded of something I talked about on Friday with regards to how these shows play out. There is never anyone on the stage who will ask the questions that need to be asked of the main players. Everyone is so busy slobbering over Musk for releasing some data or denouncing him as a blasphemer that nothing useful is asked of him. Everything gets tossed into the blender, pulsed around and it becomes a colorless slurry.<br/><br/>For example, I would like to know if there was coordination between Twitter and other tech companies to silence people. It sure looks like there was coordination. Alex Jones lost all of his accounts, even minor stuff, within a few hours on the same day. Normal people targeted by Antifa, the SPLC and ADL have found that their accounts were all closed simultaneously. It sure looks like there has been a high level of coordination in these efforts. Where is the data on that?<br/><br/>Similarly, what about these pressure groups? There has been a rumor for years now that the SPLC and ADL have access to a centralized ban list. These two groups have bragged for years that they have access to senior people at the big social media firms. It would be nice to see the correspondence between top people at these outfits with regards to censorship. If Musk genuinely cares about openness, he could crush these censures by simply posting their own words.<br/><br/>An even bigger question is how much Twitter worked with bad actors. There were stories that a Saudi spy at Twitter helped with the abduction of Khashoggi. We now know Twitter was full of thousands of people loyal to Antifa. Is it unreasonable to suspect that they were feeding user information to Antifa in the doxing campaigns? It would be a good question to ask Elon Musk, but one that will never be asked, so it will never be answered.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Twitter Drama   <br/><br/>·         Black Party <br/><br/>·         Blood Libel <br/><br/>·         China Syndrome  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="After recording the show, I remembered the name of the internet tattletale who works for the Washington Post. It is Taylor Lorenz. I looked up her Twitter and sure enough, she has not had much to say about the Twitter files story. One would think that someone hired to report on social media would be covering the biggest story about social media in a decade, but clearly word has gone forth to give the whole thing the silent treatment.<br/><br/>The curious thing is she is using her Twitter to promote her Substack venture, which suggests she does not expect to be at the Washington Post for very long. Maybe part of the great leaving alone we see with the Twitter files is a shift by the main media nodes away from social media and the sorts of weirdos who have been the center of it. You have to think that there are more than a few people at the Post embarrassed to be associated with a clown like Taylor Lorenz.<br/><br/>I said a long time ago that if I were running a media site, my fulltime people would be barred from the social media platforms. Maybe the company would maintain an official account on these sites, but the individual employees would be barred from having anything but a personal account. Why the Washington Post or the New York Times allowed its people to “break stories” on social media sites never made any sense.<br/><br/>Perhaps that reality is sinking in and we are about to see a big pullback from the mainstream media in order to protect their business. The Post and Times have been losing subs at a steady clip since the 2000 election, which has to be worrisome. It may mean nothing but it could also indicate that these sites are suffering the same demographic problem as sports. All those new American swimming over the border are not big fans of the Times crossword puzzle.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Murder Numbers<br/><br/>·         Twitter Files   <br/><br/>·         Death To The GOP!<br/><br/>·         War Woes <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="For those who do not listen to the show, there is good news. This is the last Sunday show of the year, at least I think it is, but I may change my mind. A New Year’s show about the prediction post could be fun for me to do, so we shall see. For the those who do listen to the show, there is potential good news in that I may post a show on Friday after all. I have a stack of letters and cards that should be discussed before the calendar flips, so maybe this Friday if time permits.<br/><br/>Otherwise, like lots of people I will be going into lazy man mode. Like everyone I will be enjoying the Twitter crap show that just gets funnier every day. I have no interest in rejoining Twitter, but I have been enjoying the show. News this morning says that Musk banned the miserable [bleep} Taylor Lorenz based on the new miserable [bleep] clause in the terms of service. She is now trying to nail herself to the cross as if she is a victim. This miserable [bleep] has spent her life trying to make people miserable on-line, so my hope is this drama pushes her to suicide.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Business Stuff<br/><br/>·         Are they Lying?<br/><br/>·         A Ridiculous Whopper <br/><br/>·         Ukraine’s Winter War <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I must confess that I enjoyed the McCarthy circus quite a bit. Like most reading this, I have long ago thrown in the towel on conventional politics. I no longer follow the various dramas they cook up to keep the suburban peasants distracted from important matters. I did enjoy watching these idiots and their mouth pieces in the media go crazy over the holdouts. I think every time Conservative Inc. hisses at their audience, another dissident is born.<br/><br/>That said, two things were revealed in all of this. If a small group of serious people in Congress want to throw sand in the gears and get something they want, it is not that hard. These twenty holdouts showed just how easy it is to do if you commit to it. They went into this with a plan to highlight their complaints, paint the leadership as weak and untrustworthy and then demand concessions. The point is the so-called conservatives could have been doing much more if they wanted.<br/><br/>The other important thing here is that a small group can exploit the rules to extract rule changes that they can exploit down the line. This is how the usual suspects have subverted America since the middle of the last century. Every connivance set up the next connivance. They gnawed away at the system a little at a time, by gnawing away at the rules. Again, if there are genuine reform minded people in either party, they will have to take the same approach.<br/><br/>That is unlikely to happen. What I expect is over the next year the party will systematically claw back all of these concessions. They will make a deal with the Democrats to first get rid of the rule regarding how many votes are required to remove the Speaker. Once that is passed, they will then fink on the rest of the concessions in short order. Then the twenty holdouts will be stripped of their committee assignments and given a primary opponent financed by the party.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>Charlie McCarthy Hearings<br/><br/>* Politico: Inside the 28 minutes that saved Kevin McCarthy – Link<br/><br/>* LA Times: Now the country will pay the price – Link<br/><br/>* Politico: Proposed GOP select panel – Link<br/><br/>* ZeroHedge: Here Are The Concessions McCarthy Had To Make For Speakership – Link<br/><br/>Ukraine<br/><br/>* Economist: The West sends armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine – Link<br/><br/>* The New Atlas: Latest US Arms Shipment to Ukraine – Link<br/><br/>* MSN: Ukrainian Forces Face Being Surrounded in Bakhmut – Link<br/><br/>* WaPo: Time is not on Ukraine’s side - Link<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I have been enjoying the Biden drama too much, but it is a fascinating glimpse into the black box that is our political class. Every ruling elite primarily concerns itself with preventing a peasant revolt, but senior members of the ruling elite are focused on the palace coup. That is what we are seeing with this Biden story. Some group of people inside the system have carefully plotted this political hit job and they are carefully executing it. The great mystery is who is behind the plot.<br/><br/>I did not mention this in the show, but the placement of these documents seems like something from a poorly written Hollywood script. Some are in an abandoned office. Some are in old boxes in his garage, next to his Corvette. Now we learn that more are found in an office where he was pretending to write a book, meaning he knew they were there all along. It is as if some one planted these to show how reckless Biden has been with secret documents.<br/><br/>As I said in the show, nothing about the current narrative holds up. The big red flag is the total lack of preparation within the administration. They had months to cook up a script for the media and for some reason never got around to it. It suggests that people close to the Biden inner circle made sure they were not prepared. There is a John Dean lurking in the White House. Maybe the next shoe to drop is the appearance of a Deep Throat to dish on the Biden people.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>L'affaire Biden<br/><br/>* But Trump is Worse!   <br/><br/>* Caught By Surprise <br/><br/>* Drip Drip Drip <br/><br/>Ukraine<br/><br/>Narrative versus Reality<br/><br/>* Kagan Cult Take  <br/><br/>Antiwhite News    <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The universe has a sense of humor and you see it with the pressure being applied to the Germans to supply tanks to the Ukrainians. So far, the Germans are resisting this and they are barring other countries from exporting their tanks to Ukraine. The reason given for this refusal is that the Germans have a small number of these modern tanks and they lack the ability to produce more of them. The generals are balking at the idea of de-arming themselves for Ukraine.<br/><br/>That is a legitimate concern, but a bigger concern is the optics. Western elites obsess over optics and the German elite is fanatical about it. The last thing they want are images of German tanks on fire in the Donbas or Russian tankers showing off a destroyed German tank. Then there is the inevitable photoshop opportunities to impose old German iconography on these new tanks. This would bring back what one would call unpleasant memories for the German elite.<br/><br/>There could also be another reason for their refusal. The Germans have told the Americans that they will send their tanks if the US sends Abrams tanks. This can never happen as the Abrams is unfit for this type of fighting and they cannot be sustained in the field. The Germans surely know this, but they also may understand that part of the plan is to further reduce Germany. After all, the point of NATO is to keep Russia out, America in and Germany down.<br/><br/>Time will tell but it is starting to look as if there are some cracks beginning to appear in NATO. With word filtering out of Ukraine that maybe things are not going as well as the Zelensky government has been claiming, buyer’s remorse may be setting in with some NATO countries. So far, the war has cost Europe one trillion just in increased energy costs. That number will keep growing as long as cheap energy from Russia is off the table.

    desc="On Friday night the people in charge of Memphis Tennessee released the video of the beating death of someone named after an automotive part. They released it Friday in hopes that it would result in the maximum amount of mayhem. Not only would the professional rioters have the weekend to do their worst, the media could set aside other topics to promote the riots. When I was thinking about topics for this show I assumed the riots would be a big part.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I could not fight the urge to simply ignore it. I watched the video and I was not outraged by the footage. Is what happened wrong? No doubt. The cops beat a man to death for no other reason than the impulse to do it. Frankly, if you stripped off the uniforms and set this scene in an airport terminal, it looks like many other videos of the genre. We used to have a term for this. When nonwhites went berserk like this, it was called wilding.<br/><br/>The fact is, I simply do not care about this stuff anymore. Judging from the tepid response, the general public has also tired of this stuff. The professional rioters showed up, but their volunteer auxiliaries took the weekend off. Here in Lagos about ten people showed up with signs, but the local news did not think it warranted coverage, so they used stock footage from the Freddy Gray riots. If the news cameras are not there to see the riot, did it actually happen?<br/><br/>It is probably not the lack of public interest that is draining the enthusiasm of our elites for this sort of thing, but a general cultural fatigue in the elites themselves. They have spent the better part of the last decade agitating themselves into a frenzy. Many were simply too tired to rummage around in the signaling drawer for the BLM iconography to use on the social profile.  Do they remove the Covid stuff or the Ukraine stuff to bring back the BLM stuff? <br/><br/>Speaking only for myself, I am tired of the theater of democracy. I see that a long list of Republicans are plotting to launch presidential campaigns this year. I am struggling to care. No matter who wins, the people running things will forge ahead with their policies. The borders will remain open, the Kagan cult will be waring with Russia and the pirate class will keep looting the economy. Outside the theater of democracy the world is on fire, but I am supposed to watch the show. <br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Memphis <br/><br/>* Hamilton 68 <br/><br/>* Tank You, May I have Another? <br/><br/>* Leukophobia Update  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I did not use this in the show, but I posted it on Gab the other day. I have been saying for a while that the weirdos of Conservative Inc. really think a Tim Scott – Nikki Haley ticket is the winner. I do not consume much conservative media these days, but once in a while I will tune into the cable shows just to see what they are drooling over lately. This show and occasionally the Friday show require me to consume mainstream news content.<br/><br/>Whenever I hit Fox, one of the chattering skulls will bring up Tim Scott or Nikki Haley in the context of 2024 candidates, usually couched as “if Trump does not run” but the intent is clear.  The people in television are genuinely empty vessels, so they are saying this stuff because their handlers are telling them to say it. Shows like The Five are not heavily scripted, but each actor has a role and they are given talking points to use for each topic.<br/><br/>Since 2020 I have said that the party will find a way to deny Trump the nomination. They will game the rules in the primaries or maybe even move to disqualify him because of the legal stuff that is brewing on various fronts. They will not let Trump be the nominee, but they will not let a Trump-lite guy like DeSantis sneak in either. They saw what the Democrats did in 2020 and they took notes. Their “solution” to their Trump problem will be the rainbow ticket of Scott- Haley.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Eins Luftballon <br/><br/>·         Who's The Boss <br/><br/>·         Ukraine War <br/><br/>·         Sacco & Vanzetti <br/><br/>·         Rigged Games <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One of the weirdest things of this age is how the media will ignore stories that in the past they would have covered with enthusiasm. The Seymour Hersh story on the bombing of Nord Stream is a good example of the great leaving alone that is now common. Hersh was a pillar of far left radical media for decades, so he has the proper credentials. It is not as if he is a sketchy character or on one of the enemy lists of the Left. Yet, his story has been ignored.<br/><br/>We are seeing something similar with the train wreck and chemical spill in Ohio. That is a major story that should be leading the newscasts and headlines across the country. It has the human interest angle and it fits into what used to be a comfortable media narrative. That is evil corporations not caring about the damage they cause to mother earth. Instead of that story, we get wall-to-wall coverage on the government shooting down another mysterious balloon of unknown origin.<br/><br/>I think what has happened over the last thirty years is that the media has evolved to wait for cues from the ruling class before they promote a story. If tomorrow the White House comes out with a narrative and stages a photo-op in Ohio, then all of the news sites will be leading with the story, repeating some version of the talking points. Since the White House is talking about balloons, then the story is ignored in favor of balloons. <br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Little Green Balloon Men<br/><br/>·         DeSantis - Trump <br/><br/>·         Ignoring Ohio <br/><br/>·         Spiteful Mutants <br/><br/>·         The Cult of Strauss <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I mentioned this at the end of the show, but I keep having these Bruce Banner moments where I see something in the media and I want to start smashing things. Looking at the news this morning for the show, my eye caught a story in the Washington Post claiming that thirty thousand Wagner troops have been killed in the Ukraine. The story is just a reworked copy of the press release from a cult member in the State Department, so it is not a claim by the Post.<br/><br/>Even so, there has to be someone at the Post that knows this is a lie and knows that the person providing it is a habitual liar. They know the State Department is lying, but they never ask the spokesbot from the State Department about these obvious lies. Imagine someone standing up in one of these pressers, presenting the proof of the lie and then asking the spokesbot, “Why are you telling us things that you must know are false and you must know everyone here knows are false?”<br/><br/>That can never happen, of course. The reason is the media people all dream of being a spokesbot one day or maybe getting a better gig in government. Hundreds of former media people now work in the Biden Whitehouse, just as they did in the Obama Whitehouse. Even if they do not dream of government work, they know what happens when you do not follow the script. You get ostracized and that means you get fired from the comfy media job.<br/><br/>Even knowing this, it is hard to not turn green and rampage through the neighborhood after reading the six millionth lie in the media. Even though the extreme lying is a good sign for our side, it means they have nothing left, it is still tough to take. It is not the lie or even the stupidity of the lies, but the insult that lies behind the lie. They lie because they hate us. Even if they have no reason to lie, they lie anyway because they enjoy it.

    desc="The big news of the week was CPAC, which concluded yesterday. At least I think it concluded yesterday with Trump's keynote speech. They may have something happening today. I did not go and I doubt I would ever want to go to it. I was invited to go yesterday and attend a dinner but I was too busy with the day job to break free. I am perpetually behind on everything, which is making me nuts, so I am committed to getting back on schedule no matter what.<br/><br/>From what I could tell from on-line posts, the event was about a third of what it has been in the past, but that is just going by the pictures posted. Don Jr. gave a speech on Friday in front of a room that was maybe a third full. The pics I saw of Nikki Haley’s speech looked like there was maybe a hundred people in the audience. Granted, these are not headliners. Don Jr. is a B-List celebrity and Haley is just a zombie from the blob. Even so, it suggest that maybe this thing is losing its appeal. <br/><br/>I mentioned this last week, but in the fullness of time we may look back at the Trump years as having masked the decline of Conservative Inc. He brought new people with new energy to these sorts of events, but he was breathing life into something that was dying. Another thing you see in the pics from this event is the audience is old. Like so much of 20th century America, when the Boomers exit the scene, they will take a lot of stuff with them. <br/><br/>I did see that Nick Fuentes threw together an event at the last minute. He showed up doing his wigger act, promoting Kanye West. Here is a video of it. Fuentes was late, as always, so fast forward to the middle for when he starts talking. I am told he got about fifty people to show up, which is quite a thing given that it was a spur of the moment thing. It is a shame he has embraced wiggerdom, because he has a lot of talent. Maybe he grows out of it.

    desc="I was awakened in the middle of the night one day last week to the sound of my old Twitter account being restored to life. Back when Musk took over and was granting amnesty to the damned, I submitted my request, which was promptly rejected. I never knew why my Twitter was suspended in the first place, as I barely used it. This was 2018 or thereabouts. The reason for my banning was the claim that I was encouraging suicide, which was hilarious.<br/><br/>The e-mail notifying me of my pardon stated that my followers would also be restored eventually, which I assumed meant restored to my follower count. Most were probably banned long ago and never bothered to come back. One of the amusing things back when I used Twitter was that my follower count would get about five thousand and then suddenly drop to around one thousand. This coincided with the mass purges of bad people from the system.<br/><br/>Over the last few days, I see the follower count has been ticking up, despite not doing anything or notifying anyone of the restored account. Paul Ramsey has talked about this. His follower count was capped for the longest time, until Musk took over. In weeks he added tens of thousands of followers, because the old limits were scrapped. In the fullness of time, the degree of censorship that has been going on will surprise even the most cynical.<br/><br/>This jumps out to me with Rumble. Lots of people have been moving to Rumble, so I decided to start posting the Friday show there. I was stunned by the traffic. When I used to post on YouTube, I would always get around 1500 views. It is audio only so I just assumed this was the same group of people each week using YouTube to listen rather than an app. It turns out that YouTube was simply blocking access to the channel so it was very hard to find it.<br/><br/>You see this with the video people moving to Rumble. They are noticing that their view counts are much higher than when they were on YouTube. The reason is they were limited by YouTube and most likely, YouTube lied about their view counts. That is another part of the censorship game. They overstate approved contend and understate unapproved content. The idea is to get people thinking that the bad guys are not popular while the good guys are wildly popular.<br/><br/>I think we are just scratching the surface in terms of the fakeness of everything. If they are going to such lengths to fake view counts, what else are they faking? It is not a big leap from there to faking data on the financial statements. It is not as if that is a never before done thing. Maybe that is the reason for the panic surrounding Silicon Valley Bank. Maybe the degree of fraud extends much further than the follower stats of so-called influencers on Twitter.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Forever J6 <br/><br/>* Silicon Valley Bank <br/><br/>* Winds Change For Ukraine <br/><br/>* Childless Shrew Update <br/><br/>* My Rumble <br/><br/>* My Twitter <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I record these in the morning for authenticity, but I get my thoughts together on Saturday by reading the headlines of regime media. An interesting thing I often notice is that the stories being pushed by regime media will not be featured on their front page. The New York Times relies on the lower-tiered media and pundits to push certain stories, like the Trump indictment, but they reserve the front page for the stuff that lets them maintain the façade of being a genuine news organization.<br/><br/>It speaks the deviousness of these people. They think about how they can manipulate opinion by manipulating the media system. The New York Times knows that they set the tone for certain segments of the mass media. The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and others have influence over different areas, with some overlap among all of them. One will push a new narrative and once the B and C level outlets pick it up, the other majors will produce their version of it.<br/><br/>You see it with the Jimmy Carter story. This was cooked up months ago and the point of it is to support the general claim that negative election outcomes, from the perspective of the regime, are the work of nefarious actors operating outside the rules of the system. This story is being pushed to the various conspiracy theorists in the system so they will add it to the over all narrative that includes the Russian collusion hoax and now the Dominion voting machine hoax.<br/><br/>It points to the fact that the mass media is not trying to trick the people or persuade people using propaganda in the classic sense. Most of what they do is spin yarns to support the main narratives that justify life in the managerial class. The Carter story is not for the Dirt People. It is for the Cloud people, especially the lower order Cloud People in Washington.

The window size defaults to something like letterbox, which I cannot figure out how to fix, but maybe I just get used to it.<br/><br/>It is in these times when you see that most software development is just for show.

    desc="I must admit that the Douglas Mackey verdict on Friday was a real kick in the junk that put me in a foul mood for most of yesterday. The jury being deadlocked gave me hope that maybe the fever was starting to break, but that was foolish of me. Of course, the judge made it clear to the holdouts that he would keep them locked up forever if required. These crooked judges know that normal people will eventually break if you put enough pressure on them.<br/><br/>That said, the great leaving alone the major media is giving this case suggests they know this is a problem, so they are hoping to bury it. Of course, based oligarchs like Peter Theil and Elon Musk have not lifted a finger to support Mackey. If they were anything they claim, this is the case they would use as a club over the heads of the people they pretend to oppose. It is the sort of case that offends and frightens people regardless of ideology.<br/><br/>Theil bankrolled the sex tape case by Hulk Hogan, but he had no interest in this case. The reason he hated Gawker was that they outed homosexuals. That was a part of their overall business model, which created obvious problems for Theil. Of course, the rest of the ruling class has a closet so packed with deviancy that they were happy to see Gawker go away. Weaponized media can only have one target and that is anyone who offends the people in charge.<br/><br/>That said, this is a necessary step. Each new outrage clarifies things.

The Biden administration mocking the victims of the tranny killer is so offensive it defies explanation.  These abuses destroy trust in the system and the credibility of the moralizers behind these actions.

    desc="One of the most powerful weapons in the regime’s arsenal is the false choice. They use their control of the media and the false opposition to present us with choices that serve their interests. You see it with the Ron DeSantis versus Trump narrative. The choice on offer is hate one or hate the other. That way, whoever wins will have alienated many potential supporters. It is a good way to distract critics from more important issues, as well as a way to sabotage the opposition.<br/><br/>The Left side of the regime does not care all that much, as they understand that too many states have been fortified for democracy now, but it is a fun distraction for them. The neocons, Conservatives Inc., and social media grifters, however, are deeply invested in this story. For them, this is a good way to pit various critics against one another. The internet grifters see it as a way to get attention, which is their primary reason to exist.<br/><br/>The reason the false choice works so well is it is hard to avoid being sucked into it. The Trump-bashers, in this example, are obnoxious and stupid. The DeSantis-bashers are the braindead types that show up at Trump rallies wearing the American flag. Depending upon your own hierarchy of intolerance, one will irritate you more than the other, so you get sucked into picking a side. Even when you know what is happening, the temptation is hard to resist.<br/><br/>I find myself especially irritated with the newly minted Trump-bashers like Pedro Gonzalez. I stopped reading his Twitter feed because I do not want to hate the guy. I do not want to hate DeSantis, who is a model governor. I want all GOP governors to look at him as an example of what you can do with power in your state. I do not want to see him turn into a neocon sock puppet in an effort to win the nomination and ultimately lose the general election.<br/><br/>Even knowing this, it is tough to avoid getting sucked into it. Probably the only way to avoid it is to tune it all out and wait for it to settle out on its own. That is probably more difficult than quitting smoking for most people, which speaks to the power of media. More people quit meth than quit consuming political media because meth is intoxicating and addictive. I be the space aliens running the simulation find this endlessly fascinating.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* DeSantis<br/><br/>* Fox News<br/><br/>* Twitter Versus State Media<br/><br/>* 327 Do 100<br/><br/>* Fake Leaks<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Last night I scanned through the news sites expecting it to be filled with Trump stuff, but I was pleasantly surprised to see little of it. There was one story about the current polling in the Wall Street Journal indicating that Trump has a growing lead over the field. Earlier in the week the kooks were yelping about DeSantis getting the cold shoulder from the party during his latest trip to Washington, but otherwise it has been quiet on the Trump front.<br/><br/>Similarly, there was nothing about Kennedy announcing his run for office. I did see one story that showed him polling in the mid-teens against Biden, which is actually pretty good given the state of the party and its voters. Trump started out at 15% when he ran in 2015. Kennedy will draw in the anti-war vote and most of the Sanders vote, so he will have a base of support. That is probably why the regime media is silent on his announcement. <br/><br/>Between the two, I wonder if people on our side will be much more interested in the Kennedy run than in whatever happens on the GOP side.  RFK Jr. could be the Democratic Party’s version of Trump, in that he becomes a vessel into which flows populist discontent. He is antiwar and anti-Covidian and he is picking up on the free speech cause. This will present all sorts of problems for the regime and their media toadies if Kennedy can pick up some momentum.<br/><br/>I sense fun times lie ahead.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Baltimore <br/><br/>* The Sacrament Of The Damned   <br/><br/>* Crazy People  <br/><br/>* Sudan <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="A few days ago, I posted this on Twitter. It is obviously fake, but it makes for a good bit of satire, which is always the basis for the best memes. What was surprising to me is how many crackpots got angry about it. My block list, which was already thousands long, doubled in size in just one day. I would have assumed by now that they had come accept mass immigration and demographic replacement as moral goods, but they appear to still be in denial on these topics.  The phrase “great replacement” still rattles them.<br/><br/>It raises the question that maybe the unguarded exhaust port for the regime is the idea of millions of nonwhite migrants pouring into the lily-white neighborhoods of the Left. One of the seldom discussed realities of this age is that the most progressive congressional districts, in terms of their representatives’ voting habits, are all white or all black. Nothing red pills a white progressive like seeing diversity up close and personal. White liberals like diversity from a distance, not up close.<br/><br/>That is probably why Florida and Texas quietly dropped their operation to bus migrants to places like Martha’s Vineyard. Maybe Texas is still doing it, but Neocon Ron stopped his program. The people in charge knew this was bad for them, so they made sure the people in these states got the message about shipping migrants to white progressive areas. Again, Texas may still be doing this, but I have seen nothing in the news about it for months.<br/><br/>Not that matters in the short run, but it is a good reminder that the zombies chanting progressive slogans do so from the comfort of white nationalist locations. Joe Sobran said, “In their mating and migratory habits, liberals are indistinguishable from members of the Ku Klux Klan.” Much later I condensed this in to, “They talk like MLK, but live like the KKK.” Not only is this true, at some level they know it is true and it terrifies them more than anything.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>The Red Vest <br/><br/>Intolerant Bastards <br/><br/>Gun Grabbers <br/><br/>Not Funny <br/><br/>Neocon Ron <br/><br/>Fortified For Democracy <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The other day at breakfast, the conversation turned to darker topics, like the fate of the Marine who killed the lunatic on the subway. Someone turned to me and asked if I thought the Marine would avoid being charged. I said no and he will most likely be overcharged and be convicted. Everyone just nodded and it was at that point I realized I had moved into the optimist camp.<br/><br/>What I mean by that is normal people are watching this stuff and slowly moving to the pessimist camp, while I have not moved much at all. Five years ago, I was considered to be a pessimist, for warning about the response to Trump and many other things. The people who thought I was wrong about Covid now think it was a massive hoax. The world comes at you fast, as they say.<br/><br/>The reason the one guy asked me if I thought the Marine had a chance was that he was looking for a little hope, but even sunny optimists like me are running low on hope these days. The unrestrained assault on the legal system we are seeing is a sign that things are about to get much worse. It is one thing to exploit the law in the game of lawfare. It is another thing entirely to assault the law itself.<br/><br/>Pessimism should never be confused with despair. Life in normal times is the story of ups and downs, the former often tempting us more than the latter.  I am reminded of the story of Sir Sidney Smith, who was a British officer in the Napoleonic wars. He had been captured and thrown into a dungeon as he was the one British officer Napoleon truly feared. In prison he left Napoleon a note.<br/><br/>\"Fortune's wheel makes strange revolutions, it must be confessed; but for the term revolution to be applicable, the turn of the wheel must be complete. You are today as high as you can be. Very well. I envy not your good fortune, for mine is better still. I am as low in the career of ambition as a man can well descend; so that, let this capricious dame, fortune, turn her wheel ever so little--I must necessarily mount, for the same reason you must descend.\"<br/><br/>Smither finished his note with, \"I make not this remark to cause you any uneasiness, but rather to bring you that consolation which I shall feel when you are arrived at the same point where I now am--yes! at the same point where I now am. You will inhabit this same prison--why not as well as I? I no more thought of such a thing, than you do at present, before I was actually shut up in it.\"<br/><br/>Smith escaped the prison and was instrumental in defeating Napoleon in the Middle East. While Smith was present at Waterloo, he did not participate. He went on to do other things and was eventually knighted. Sidney New York is named after Sir Sidney Smith. Before Napoleon died, he is reported to have said of Smith, \"That man made me miss my destiny.” Sir Sidney Smith is a lesson for all of us.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>Self-Hatred <br/><br/>The Civil Theocracy <br/><br/>Persecuting Heretics <br/><br/>The War on The Law <br/><br/>Kill Whitey <br/><br/>American Terrorism <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One of the things I am not looking forward to is the official launch of the DeSantis campaign, which is due in the next few weeks. The main reason is I have no interest in hearing the same feckless liars who made up the Never Trump crowd do their act a second time. I have a low tolerance for lying, especially when the people doing the lying know I know they are lying. It is insulting.<br/><br/>That is manageable, but what I am really not going to enjoy is seeing people who should know better go down the bitter anti-Trump sewer. I stopped following Pedro Gonzalez, for example, because he has gobbled down the bitter pill. He now sounds like a slightly less masculine version of Ann Coulter. He should be a good resource in our cause, but instead he will turn himself into a clown for clicks.<br/><br/>That seems to be the issue with the bitter crowd. Being one of the crowd with regards to Trump is not profitable on social media as there are lots of Trump fans. Taking a neutral stance never gets clicks, so that leaves being anti-Trump. It is the old edgytarian act. When I wrote that I thought it was about to die out, but I was wrong. It was updated to be spergy contrarian guy.<br/><br/>That said, you have to hand it to the people in charge. They are baiting DeSantis into the race because they know it will create problems. It will dirty up Trump, but mostly it will eliminate DeSantis as a potential running mate and as a 2028 candidate. It is a good reminder that the bad guys are not winning because they are stupid.

    desc="During my first visit to AmRen back in 2015, I noticed that everyone talked about their journey, as in their ideological journey. Many people came through the libertarian door, but most took the logical journey from conservatism through the paleo space and then over the great divide. At that time, the journey was fresh enough that people still followed conventional politics and the failures of Conservative Inc to conserve anything.<br/><br/>I thought about that the when seeing some stories about the debt ceiling stuff. If I had not been scanning the normie news sites for content, I never would have thought about it. If I chose to write about it, the comments that day would be mostly off-topic stuff. No one on this side of the great divide cares about the debt ceiling. No one cares about the budget or taxes or any of the other stuff that the parties are including in their show.<br/><br/>Scanning Twitter, it is hard to find much interest in normie land either. There is far more interest in black on white crime. Thousands of posts depicting the latest outrage. There is Ukraine stuff. When you travel to black Twitter it is the usual hate whitey stuff. The rage heads from the media are obsessing over the Florida banning child mutilation, when they are not raging about Trump. The parties are putting on a debt show, and no one cares.<br/><br/>In other words, it is not just people on this side of the great divide who have abandoned conventional politics for other issues. No one cares. The reason for that is you care about conventional politics when you generally think everyone is concerned about the same things. The issue is the priority and how best to address those things. When the only thing that matters is the enemy, real or imagined, then there is no need to worry about what happens in Washington.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Debt Ceiling <br/><br/>* Ukraine <br/><br/>* New Planes <br/><br/>* Travel Warning <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I decided to change things up a bit for the long holiday weekend. This is one of the slowest times for the site as people are busy doing fun things or getting ready for the summer. The summer is always the quietest time for the site and these long holiday weekends are the slowest. I thought about skipping the show entirely but that is a bad habit to develop. Doing this is a lot like going to the gym. If you take a break, it can easily become a long break, so it is best to never take a break.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see how engaged people are with the political races this summer. My sense is no one cared a bit about the phony-baloney debt ceiling drama. What little I saw online was people making fun of the media for pretending that this was anything but pointless nonsense. It is like a poorly done reboot of a movie that was not all that good the first time. The original had some big-name stars, but the reboot has nobodies and the same terrible script as the original.<br/><br/>That may not bode well for DeSantis. People sense that this is a remake of the 2016 show with DeSantis playing the role of Ted Cruz. Jeb Bush and the other zombies have been replaced by a diverse cast because nothing sells like diversity. People may just tune out for the summer. They may have already tuned out, given that the DeSantis story lasted about two days. Maybe one result of the years of lunacy is people will just tune out of politics, at least for the summer.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Debt Ceiling<br/><br/>* Elections In Turkey<br/><br/>* Pipe Heads <br/><br/>* Finks <br/><br/>* Rat Jerks <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Something that has not be mentioned with regards to the Trump indictment is how the timeline for this and the other legal issues will run. Our court system moves at a glacial pace. Douglas Mackey was charged in January of 2021 and did not see a trial until March of 2023. His case was straightforward and simple compared to the case against Trump. There will be many appeals court hearings before we ever get to an actual trial if it ever happens.<br/><br/>As a practical matter, it means this case will be hanging over the primary and general election next year, which may be the whole point of the exercise. One of the weirdest aspects of the current crisis is how our bourgeois dictators live within narratives of their own creation. It is entirely possible that they have spun a tale for themselves that says the indictment of Trump craters his support and this leads to him dropping out of the race in order to save face.<br/><br/>To a normal person this sounds crazy, but time and again we see these people create fantasy versions of reality and then carry on as if it is all true. After all, if you can pretend that these moronic pride celebrations are sensible, you can convince yourself of anything. The people who think indicting Trump is a great “own” also thought the Russian collusion hoax stuff was real. They also thought it was a good idea to wear your underwear around your head to keep the cooties away.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see the polling over the next few weeks. Trump has come out swinging, which is a very good look for him. He showed up at the Waffle House in Georgia and mingled with the people and paid for everyone’s meal. He then gave a fiery speech at a North Carolina GOP event. Americans love an underdog, especially one that shows grit. My hunch is we see Trump’s numbers jump. We may also see DeSantis take a hit, despite his support for Trump in this matter.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         The Rule Of Men <br/><br/>·         RIP Uncle Ted <br/><br/>·         The New Religion <br/><br/>·         The N-Word <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Looks like the lazy hazy days of summer are upon us. Scanning the news sites, I did not see much about the subjects the big foot journos are paid to cover. The Washington press gaggle is headed for vacation and the politicians will soon be following them. The low-ranking journos will be sent off to follow the candidates around this summer, but the content creators and narrative makers will be at swanky summer conferences paid for by the non-profit industrial complex.<br/><br/>Looking at the aggregators, the Trump stuff was missing and there were no stories about the long promised Ukrainian counter-offensive. Looks like we will get a break from this stuff for a little while unless something pops. My guess is they are timing the Trump stuff as part of the overall narrative they have created for the primary. The next big event on the calendar is the August debates, so maybe they have Trump arrested so he cannot attend the debate.<br/><br/>That said, this is feeling like a normal summer again. We got some normalcy back last summer but there was still a hangover from Covid. This year it is back to the familiar pattern. Schools have let out around here so people are on vacation.

    desc="The last 48 hours provided another example of a Caesar moment that fell short due to the guy who was cast in the role of Caesar losing his nerve at the last minute. Someone on Russian Twitter noted that Trump was supposed to be the man but lost his nerve on January 6. Bolsonaro had his moment on January 8th. Imran Khan had his chance to lead a revolt against the ruling junta but lost his nerve . Now we have Prigozhin backing down at the last minute.<br/><br/>There are two ways to look at this. One is the system is breaking down and that opens the door for rule by men rather than the rule of law. Biden is far more dictatorial than Trump. Lula is much more comfortable with power than Bolsonaro. The rules are no longer working so you get a challenge from a strong leader. The people in the system responded with the use of dictatorial power not so much to defend the rules but to defend their positions.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it can also be read as a successful defense against Caesarism. This line of reasoning works in the case of the Prigozhin incident. The Russian political system shrugged off this attempt to challenge it without spilling blood. The Pakistani system has done the same, but with the usual chaotic violence that defines the political life of that world. It is hard to know where things go in America and Brazil, so this line of reasoning does not work in those cases.<br/><br/>Of course, there is some chance this event has Kremlin fingerprints on it. The way Putin handled this raises a few red flags, suggesting there was something else happening behind the scenes. There is speculation that Putin let this proceed as a way to subvert critics inside the Kremlin. There is a faction unhappy with the war. These are the rich guys who do business in the West. Then you have the hawks who would like to nuke Kiev.<br/><br/>This weird rebellion forced everyone to rally to the flag and rally to Putin. If we have a spate of Russian billionaires drowning in their bathtubs or jumping off buildings, we can assume they were not enthusiastic enough for Putin in this incident. If Prigozhin settles into quiet retirement or he is rehabilitated in the next year, then we can assume his performance in this drama was something other than what is being presented by him and the Kremlin.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>·         Russia Russia Russia!    <br/><br/>·         Republican Side  <br/><br/>·         Democrat Side  <br/><br/>·         No Labels  <br/><br/>·         Lying Liars Of Science <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I was expecting a slow news week, so I thought maybe I would skip the show, but the news is jam packed with stuff. The court cases and the French riots are the two big items. I have said as much as I need to say at the moment on the affirmative action court case, but this is just the start of the dissident critique of the issue. The chattering skulls in conventional politics are still chewing on the superficial aspects, but it will be left to people on this side to tackle the core issue.<br/><br/>The French riots are an interesting thing. The fact that they look so much like the Saint George Floyd, peace be upon him, riots is striking. As we all know, there was nothing organic about the summer of Floyd, so it raises the question of who is behind these riots. On the other hand, it could simply be a case of monkey see, monkey do. These people consume American cultural product more than they consume what is left of French culture.<br/><br/>The rumor I like so far is that the French army is thinking about a coup. I doubt this could happen, but it would be glorious if it did happen. It would blow a massive hole in the EU project. You cannot be gassing on about democracy when a core member of the project just had a coup and is now run by a military junta. It would also expose the current political system as impotent and illegitimate. This is why I highly doubt such a thing can happen. The generals are as degenerate as the politicians.<br/><br/>On the other hand, things can get out of hand quickly. The blackouts in Western media suggest there is a real concern about what is happening. When you have blacks looting armories and then using those weapons to fire on the cops, we are beyond the race riot stage. France now has a large population of alien savages that want only to make war on France and French people. There is only one end to this, so it is just a question of how we reach that end.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* It’s A Riot<br/><br/>* The Biden Putsch <br/><br/>* The Gays <br/><br/>* Little Lindsey <br/><br/>* DeSantis Woes <br/><br/>* Zombie Terror <br/><br/>* Old Degenerates <br/><br/>* Antiracism <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

It is an interview with the lead attorney on the affirmative action cases decided by the court last week. It is one of those pieces that has a lot of layers to it once you figure out what is happening. It is, in effect, a clash between two moral codes that cannot exist simultaneously.<br/><br/>The interviewer is espousing the new code of equity and diversity. For her, the moral society is one free of whiteness, which can only be measured by counting heads. She also maintains the highly superficial notion of race as skin color. This is necessary in order to maintain the blank slate. The attorney represents the old civil right moral framing. In his view, all discrimination based on race is immoral, so the only way to avoid it is to never acknowledge it.<br/><br/>He is, of course, doing what conservatives have done for generations. He wants to get the desired result within the progressive moral framework. In the case of colleges, he wants a merit-based system based on objective measures, but at the same time says that discrimination is always wrong. The other side insists that the only way to know we are free of discrimination is by counting heads. The moral good of a discrimination free world requires open discrimination against whites.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Affirmative Action <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

Poor old Mike Pence took the worst of it, mostly because he offended Tucker with his answers. Why his people sent him out there without the proper software update is a mystery. If smoke started coming out of Pence’s collar and his eyes started flashing red, it would not have surprised me.<br/><br/>Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, no doubt, are thankful that Pence made an ass of himself, as no one was talking about their terrible performances.

Watching the Tuckercide, I doubt Trump has any concerns for these people. I do suspect he would like to avoid a shouting match with Chris Christie.

    desc="I have said for a long time that the real power of the media is the power to ignore, and we are seeing this with the Biden scandals. Breitbart will cover it, but they do so in a tabloid way. It just becomes another chant in the conservative zombie chant book. Regime media can then point at the chanting and claim it is a conspiracy theory. What should be the biggest story since Watergate is treated like it is an uninvited guest by the Washington media.<br/><br/>Compounding it is the fact that the Biden piece may be the tip of the iceberg. People forget that the regime tried to remove Trump for the crime of looking into Ukraine. John Kerry’s kids were in on the same scam as Hunter Biden. Pelosi’s kids were also in the racket. The truth is, everything and everyone has been for sale in Washington for a long time now. Ukraine was just one of the buyers as the auction. Yet, no one even thinks about connecting the dots.<br/><br/>There is another angle to it. No one in the regime media or in either party feels the need to address any of this stuff. A cavalier attitude has slowly crept into the culture of Washington. They are beginning to realize that they do not have to keep up appearances. It is not as if they will be voted out of office or face some sort of backlash from the public.

    desc="Way back when I started talking about Tim Scott being the Republican nominee, most people assumed it was a joke, but I was serious. The regime is increasingly controlled by narratives that gain popularity inside the ruling class. Once the narrative becomes established, everyone acts to make the narrative come true. Not only does it become immoral to question the narrative, but everyone is also required to do their part to further the narrative.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the past, the narrative on the Republican side was that Trump would be removed from the primary either legally or procedurally. They would indict him enough that he either agreed to bow out or the party would be forced to remove him from the ticket. DeSantis would be Scott Walker 2.0 and drop out before he ruined his career completely. That would leave Tim Scott as the guy to be the Republican Obama, who would restore things back to before Trump.<br/><br/>To sane people, this sounds nuts, but we are not ruled by sane people. This Ross Douthat post pretending like he just heard about the plot to make Tim Scott the nominee is another sign that the wheels are slowly grinding along to make the narrative into reality. Douthat plays the role of sober minded intellectual conservative. The task for the people playing this role is to pretend to slowly come around to this idea as the solution to the Trump crisis.<br/><br/>It remains to be seen if they can pull it off. As we see with the Ukraine disaster, these people may be crazy, but they are also quite stupid. Yanking Trump off the ballot at the convention could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. There is a lot of simmering anger in American society. Worse yet for the regime is that white racial consciousness is become a thing. Close to 80% of Trump supporters think antiwhite prejudice is an important issue. Tim Scott could be a tipping point.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Goodbye Ron <br/><br/>* Killing The Courts <br/><br/>* Self-Love <br/><br/>* Battery Fires <br/><br/>* Carny Strike <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Another week, another gathering of the lunatics to dance around displaying their outrage over Donald Trump and everything associated with him. I am out of outrage juice, so I was not outraged by the latest batch of indictments. It is depressing to think that my country is collapsing into an authoritarian girly state run by hypersensitive snowflakes, but this is all predictable. There is no point in being outraged or even flustered by it. There is nothing to be done about it right now.<br/><br/>This is a good example of how people mistakenly think the opposite of joy is anger. It is the warped binary thinking of the hive people. They also demand we accept that hatred is the opposite of acceptance or that irrational fear is the oppositive of blind loyalty. In reality, indifference is the opposite of both love and anger. Indifference is the opposite of blind loyalty and irrational fear. Love and hate, loyalty and opposition stem from caring. The opposite of caring is indifference.<br/><br/>This is some wisdom I passed onto Ricard Hanania after one of the online tattletales revealed that Hanania once trafficked in banned thoughts. I told him to ignore it. The lifeblood of these kooks doxing people is the attention of the people they are attacking and especially their friends and supporters. Ignore them and you deny them what they want most of all, your caring about them. Indifference is a powerful weapon. In the end, it may be the penultimate weapon in our arsenal. <br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Outrage Fatigue<br/><br/>* The N In NASCAR <br/><br/>* Death Of College Sports <br/><br/>* Guilty Until proven Otherwise <br/><br/>* As Goes Grimace <br/><br/>* I Will Die At The Office <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The first debate of the 2024 cycle is this Wednesday. I may live blog it on the site or on Gab, assuming I have been properly medicated. In the past I have live blogged these debates, but I needed to be properly lubricated to do it. Drinking during the week is never a great idea, but the level of alcohol required to watch one of these things means taking a few days off afterwards. On the other hand, maybe I do it stone cold sober and see how much pain I can tolerate.<br/><br/>Hilariously, they still have not figured out who will be on the stage. It looks like some of the minor candidates have figured out how to game the system. The Bugman guy from North Dakota was the first to figure it out, but others have followed with their own scams. Of course, I am hoping all of them get on the stage, so it looks like a line at a bus station. That also increases the odds that one of the crazy guys does something very crazy in order to get attention.<br/><br/>These debates are a great example of how insulated and inward looking the political system has become over the last few decades. In the past, the campaigns would have prevented this sort of thing because they would have understood it was bad public relations. Team DeSantis would have demanded that the goofballs be removed so their guy could get more airtime and avoid being seen next to some guy named Bugman or the guy who reminds everyone of a Simpson’s character.<br/><br/>These days the campaigns are all run by people who live in Washington. The debate shows are for the entertainment of Washington.  The oleaginous consultants will be boasting to everyone about the lines they inserted into their robot’s mouth. The zombies from Conservative Inc. will be wheeled out to drool on about trivial nonsense as if it matters to anyone. This debate is a show for people who look at elections as a way to make money and pad their resume.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Debate Prep  <br/><br/>* The Corruption <br/><br/>* Tucker The Jerk <br/><br/>* Narrative Construction <br/><br/>* Polling <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Decided to break from the normal routine and ramble on about my thoughts while walking back from the farm stand yesterday. There will be plenty of news to cover as we move into the autumn, so this week is a news free show. That and I recorded a podcast with Pete Quinones on the Republican debate, Trump, and the usual stuff. The show will be available tomorrow on Odysee. Pete is a good host, which is not a skill we see a lot of in the podcasting scene.<br/><br/>Something I did not mention in the show is just how hard it is to watch any sporting event on television these days due to the tsunami of ads. I tuned into the Notre Dame – Navy game in Dublin. It was supposed to start at 2:30 PM but it kicked off at 2:45 PM so they could bash the viewer over the head with ads and lectures. The show probably lasted three hours, which is the typical length of a football game these days, which means a football game is mostly ads and sermons.<br/><br/>That last part is the important bit. The ads are mostly about selling the morality of the day while briefly mentioning the product. Notice no ad for a thing ever mentions the practical features and benefits of the thing itself, but rather the social credit for having the thing. The main thrust of car ads, for example, is that you will be seen as a better person driving a certain car. Of course, many ads are really for the latest thing and not a thing you could use.<br/><br/>The sermons are the worst. I made it through a few series of the Notre Dame – Navy game until they put on a sermon about girls playing sports. I think it was an ad from the NCAA, but it was a lecture about how we have to force girls to play sports so they can go to college and then be all the things boys should be but are prevented from being because reasons. No one sits down to watch a game in order to get these lectures, but they are ubiquitous.<br/><br/>Of course, it is much more obvious to me now that I rarely watched normal television. I watch stuff on YouTube with an ad blocker. The only time I see ads is when I watch a YouTube show on my television, which does not have the ad blocker. Watching regular television with the tsunami of ads and sermons is like being dropped into North Korea. This explains why they work so hard to keep people plugged into mass media culture.

    desc="The end of summer is finally here, which means the election season officially starts. I have said this a million times, but it bears repeating. I am not all that interested in this election. There is a very good chance that it makes 2020 look like the model of integrity. The shenanigans in both parties will set all-time single season records for shenanigans. I like shenanigans as much as the next guy, but I am struggling to get interested in what is coming down the road.<br/><br/>The reason is mendacity fatigue. There is a limit to how much lying one can take before you find it both boring and exhausting.  Everything the Never Trump loons say is a lie. Everything the various influencers online say about the candidates is a lie. The regime toadies do nothing but lie. Of course, the regime is a volcano of lies that rain down on us all day, every day. It is exhausting trying to keep up with the lies and there is no real benefit to doing it. It is all a pointless noise.<br/><br/>That is another thing that is sapping my interest. If there was some chance that someone could do something useful in the White House, I could maybe talk myself into grasping at that straw, but that is the lesson of the last decade. There is so solution at the ballot box. If by some miracle Trump wins, we know he will do nothing, even if he actually tries to do something. None of the zombies will do anything but more of the things everyone hates.<br/><br/>Maybe that is the 4-D chess being played. The people in charge have grown tired of the farce of elections, so they are trying to make them as awful as possible. At some point they offer blessed relief by cancelling further elections. To save our democracy, we have to end these terrible elections that are causing people to lose faith in democracy. It sounds ridiculous, but is it anymore absurd that the stuff we now see every day in the political system? <br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Fake Polls <br/><br/>* The Never Trump Plans <br/><br/>* Youngkin <br/><br/>* Neon Nikki <br/><br/>* Fat People <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Microsoft decided that my computer needed an update, so it must have rebooted in the middle of the night. I turn off the automatic updates, but a feature of many updates is to turn that back on without telling you. I try to remember to check but I often forget as I should not have to do this. Think about the arrogance of the people on the other side. It is a part of bourgeois entitlement that probably deserves a post or even a show about it.<br/><br/>I use my computer as an alarm clock. I wanted to get an early start, so I set the alarm for six, but the machine rebooted, and the alarm only works when I am logged in for some reason. I wound up getting up later than I wanted which started the day off on a sour note. I settled in to record the show and the playback was weird, like I was speaking from a cave. I realized that the update had scrambled my settling again, so I had to put those back before I started.<br/><br/>This is a well-known feature of Windows. Whenever there is an update, which is weekly at this point, the update randomly changes your settings. I notice the sound settings because I use them a few times a week, but I am told it is other things as well. I have noticed that if I use Microsoft Teams, a terrible application, it messes up the audio for other apps like Zoom and GotToMeeting. Windows has not fundamentally changed in decades and this nonsense continues.<br/><br/>This is an issue all over. Telegram ships a bug fix a few times a week. This means that their bug fixes are actually fixing bugs from prior bug fixes. It is recursive bug fixing. Since so much code is now written by poor people in India, it is bug fixes all the way down.  Even old code bases like Windows are hopelessly caught in the web of bug fixes. It is no wonder we are seeing systemic failure like that which struck United Airlines last week.

    desc="It is officially autumn, so it is officially election season, but surprisingly there is little in the regime media about the looming election. You can find stuff on the Wednesday Republican debate, but it is all from small-time players in the media. The Sunday postings from regime media had none of the stuff we got prior to the last debate. Maybe they are saving it for this week or maybe there is a shift going on in the narrative and the new version is not ready.<br/><br/>That is a weird thing with our media. When the official narrative falls apart, regime media figures simply put the topic aside until they are given a new narrative. The first debate was supposed to top off the old narrative that said Trump was losing support due to the indictments. Instead, the first debate was a comedy of errors that only boosted Trump’s numbers. Without a new narrative, this coming debate is that tree falling in the woods when no one is around to hear it.<br/><br/>The problem they have is they have gone too far down the road with the old narrative, so there is no turning back from the Trump indictment stuff. At some point they will have to remove Trump from the ballot either in the primary or the general election. There is an argument that the 14th Amendment requires states to remove him from the ballot.

    desc="Everyone can come in off the ledge. The great fear has passed, at least for forty-five days, while your heroic representatives hammer out a long-term solution. That’s right, the Republicans folded on the spending bill, as everyone knew they would. Not only did they fold, but the GOP leadership plotted with the other party to fink extra hard on the few Republicans putting up a fight. It is a story as old as politics, at least Washington politics.<br/><br/>If the Republican Party was a real party, the House Republicans would have abstained from the whole thing and let the other party do what they wanted. The narrative says the good guys have to beat the bad guys and get everything they want, so the way to beat the narrative is to not play the assigned role and just let the Democrats do what they want. The bill would go to the Senate and that would be the end of it, thus depriving the Hive of the chance to play out the drama.<br/><br/>That is how you know it is all fake. Even the noises made by the few holdouts are all fake, as they surely knew from the start how things would go. If people like Matt Gaetz were honest, he would refuse to participate in any of it. Instead, he plays his role as the “Extreme MAGA Republican” who is attacking “our democracy” like some sort of Japanese monster.

    desc="The big news is obviously the Israel business, which has all of the usual suspects either whipped into a frenzy, trying to whip you into a frenzy or whipping themselves into a frenzy. It was an amazing thing to watch yesterday as all the important people put on their killer face and demanded the Israeli government murder every Muslim they could find.  Even Jordan Peterson sobered up for a few minutes to tweet out his call for jihad against Islam.<br/><br/>It was a fun day of mask dropping. So many accounts on Twitter were suddenly demanding a final solution for the Palestinians. Of course, many of them were super supportive of Ukraine. I suspect part of the bloodlust on display was due to the looming reality of the Ukraine project. They sense they will need some new blood to lust after, so it is back to the Middle East. They will be taking down their Ukraine iconography and putting back up the Israel stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, for the cucks it was a cuck-a-rama. All of our favorite cucks from Conservative Inc. were competing to see who could cuck the hardest for Israel. David French managed to combine his love for Ukraine with his love for Israel. Many spent the day robotically posting “Israel is our greatest ally” or something similar. It was like everyone went back to the year 2000 to relive their heyday just after the 9/11 attacks. Many even compared yesterday to 9/11, which is hilarious.<br/><br/>It is a good example of the systemic nature of our politics. There is a massive, well-funded Israel Industrial Complex that is always poised to exploit any opportunity. The same is true for other things like race, climate, or abortion.  When something happens, it is go-time and all nodes start to blink, which sets off the volunteer army of associated believers. The result is the orgy we saw yesterday or what we saw after the George Floyd incident.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Israel Industrial Complex<br/><br/>* The Issue Industry<br/><br/>* Indifference<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Someday the robot historians will be looking at the before times and puzzle over how the Global American Empire succumbed to so many manufactured dramas. More important, it will puzzle over how the ruling class of the empire invested so heavily in creating them. The last thirty years have been one after another, that follow the usual arc. First, we get the triggering event, which is followed by the initial players rushing onto the stage to sound the alarm.<br/><br/>The initial players are always the usual suspects that turn up in these sorts of things, but this time it is different, as they are soon joined by the narrative makers. These are the people who provide the narrative structure to connect this triggering event to what must come next. That is when the players from the clouds arrive to do their part in support of the story. Maybe they add something to move the story along or maybe they amplify some aspect of it.<br/><br/>Often, reality does not cooperate, so the narrative falls apart and the narrative makers are called back to patch up the script.  Then we get another round of the various players learning their lines and performing their roles. If the required script fails, then the show closes and we move onto the next production, which is always ready.

    desc="One of the defining features of the last ten or so years is the small awakenings that happen from time to time, usually triggered by an event. The big example is the Trump phenomenon where all the so-called conservatives dropped the mask. All of a sudden, millions of people were suddenly made aware of the fact that conservatism was a scam. Those chattering skulls who you thought were on your side were suddenly snarling and bearing their fangs at you.<br/><br/>We are seeing something like this with Israel. Twenty years ago, the Israel lobby would have been much more restrained in their calls for blood. They would have avoided sounding like they were out for vengeance. Washington would have been careful to play the role of peacemaker, even as it took the side of Israel. Now, the Israel lobby is calling for the slaughter of women and children, while Washington threatens anyone who speaks out against it.<br/><br/>This is having a corresponding result domestically. The polling on the general topic of Israel versus Gaza is interesting. Republican zombies respond as trained, but there are far fewer zombies now. People have dug into the age distribution, and you see the pro-Israel camp is old white people. Even amongst that cohort, support for Israel is far lower than in the past. In Europe, there is no support for Israel. They also are seeing massive protests by their imported Arab population in support of Gaza.<br/><br/>We are seeing one of those moments when the regime runs the old playbook, but the plays are not working, and the people see that they are not working. In the process of trying to gaslight the public like usual, the public is noticing the gaslighting. It is like when the audience catches the magician’s sleight of hand during the trick. The audience knows it is a trick, but part of the fun is in the magician’s ability to conceal the trick. That is the real magic of the act.<br/><br/>In a time of crises, these revelatory moments are what erode the people’s trust in their rulers and the system that enables their rule. It is a vicious cycle. The more the people catch onto the tricks, the harder they try to trick the people. The skepticism over this Israel business has led to hyper-gaslighting, which has increased skepticism. If they are struggling to whip support for Israel, imagine what happens when they call for sacrifice in a down economy.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Muh Freedumb <br/><br/>* Not My People <br/><br/>* They Hate You   <br/><br/>* The Brown Shrew   <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I did not spend any time on it in the show, but it is related to the end of the Mike Pence experience and the rise of the new Speaker. In both cases, the determinative issue is Israel. Pence, like all establishment conservatives, was running for the blessing of the neocons. He was battling Tim Scott, Nikki Haley and to a lesser degree Ron DeSantis, remember him? These candidates are all looking for the support of the people who want to blow up the world and save Israel.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, they are the same people who run imperial foreign policy and control the flow of money into the Republican Party. This is how they landed on this Johnson guy as the Speaker. The neocons love him because he is berserk for Israel, and he is controllable.  Listen to this guy and he comes off as sort of a Ned Flanders type of guy. Sociable and pleasant, but oddly unaware of how things actually work in Washington, especially when it comes to the neocons.<br/><br/>What we are seeing is a great lesson in who really runs things in the empire. There is zero skepticism in Washington over the latest project. In fact, they are falling all over each other to show how much they love Israel and want to blow up the world. Haley is the big winner in all this as she is the most ruthlessly bloodthirsty and conveniently devoid of a conscience. With Pence gone, the pressure will be on DeSantis and Scott to drop out of the race. Maybe they will get promised the VP slot.<br/><br/>My prediction when all this started is the party would setup a Haley – Scott or a Scott – Haley ticket, as this is the ultimate Big Lie ticket. The claim that these two stiffs genuinely won the nomination would be a lie so outlandish that no one would want to think anyone \"could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously\". Thinking about it, I could also imagine a Haley – DeSantis ticket.

    desc="A thing to watch as we hurdle toward the 2024 election is how people respond to the mass media and the army of people online who exist to respond to the mass media. Lots of people turned online media criticism into a career during the 2016 election and now they are sort of a weird counter-establishment that is as entrenched as the people they critique. That is something I noticed with the fake Ukraine story that is the heart of the show this week. The critics accepted the fakery without question.<br/><br/>The dynamic between critic and his object of criticism is something like an old couple that quarrels all the time in that the two sides have come to be defined by their quarreling. All those people who got rich in internet money chanting about fake news in the Trump years found out they needed the fake news to keep their act going, so they now treat the regime media with much more respect. They will still do their fake news act, but it is much more selective.<br/><br/>This popped off the screen with the Israel – Gaza stuff. Many of the fake news warriors happily trumpeted the claims from the media, as if the people who have lied about everything to this point were suddenly telling the truth. Breitbart quickly became unreadable due to the total lack of skepticism about the claims coming from the Zionists. No one should be shocked or offended that the Zionists are screaming for blood, but no one should take their claims at face value.<br/><br/>Then there is the fact that people are tired of repeats. The war in the Levant is a reboot of the Bush franchise and no one wants any part of it. Rebooting the Trump franchise, along with the MAGA stuff, the fake news stuff, the on-line media criticism, may meet a similar fate. It is not just that people are not interested in a Biden - Trump reboot, it is that they may not be interested in all of the stuff that comes with it, including the platforms like Twitter.<br/><br/>It all feels like we are at the end of the road in some way. The reboot of the meme war that is coming will not be all that interesting. The reboot of the MAGA rallies will not be fun. The tsunami of lies from the lie machine will not be worth fighting. None of this stuff feels like it is worth the effort, even if you want to be outraged. As the kids used to say, it is all fake a gay.

    desc="I am back after a couple weeks off from doing the Sunday show. One week I was in Germany and one week I was too sick to record. The plague that tried to take me out was a nasty one. I rarely get sick and when I do it is for a day or two tops. I often get what I call plane sickness, which is basically a cold that lasts about a day when I return. It is twenty-four hours of a mild fever, one night of weird dreams and then maybe a day of recovery from a very mild cold.<br/><br/>Somewhere in my delirium I wondered if the trend toward working at home is going to result in more sever colds and flus, at least for some people.  The nature of my work and now working from home means I interact with far fewer humans than in the past. When we had the office, I socialized at work with people and with the people in the building. I went to lunch most days and traded germs with many strangers at various lunch places.<br/><br/>Over the last year, I have gone days without interacting in person with another human. My office is now next to my bedroom. I get up, write, have breakfast then shower and make the five-step commute to the office to do the day job. The diner is now in my kitchen. Meetings are zoom sessions. I try to take a long walk every day, but I rarely see another human, unless he is running for his life from the locals, which is a feature of life in Lagos.<br/><br/>Around here about half of workers work at home. During the day, the streets are empty as the number of people going out for lunch is half what it used to be, you see it at the fast-food places that used to have massive lines at lunchtime. The point is lots of people are now working at home, which means they have far fewer contacts with other humans and therefore fewer contacts with germs. In other words, the new pod life that is evolving is going to make us more vulnerable to germs.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Fink Romney <br/><br/>* Goofballs <br/><br/>* Stop Complaining <br/><br/>* Killing Chauvin <br/><br/>* The Kid Sniffer Problem <br/><br/>* We Are Alone <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

The Russians were in no hurry to launch a big offensive and the Ukrainians were bogged down in planning their offensive.<br/><br/>As is usually the case, that prediction is turning out to be wrong. Things are getting very weird in Ukraine militarily and politically. First there is this public dispute between the commander of Ukrainian armed forces Zaluzhnyi and the dictator of Ukraine Zelensky. Then you have members of Budanov’s entourage, including his wife, coming down with heavy metal poisoning. Both Zelensky and Zaluzhnyi are openly talking about eliminating the other from the scene.<br/><br/>Then last week Zelensky did a tour of the battlefields, meeting with all of the generals, except for Zaluzhnyi, who was off somewhere else. Then we get word that the Ukraine army is in retreat along the middle of the front. Some say it is to assume more defensible positions while others say it is to minimize losses and reduce the chances of the army revolting against Zelensky. In some of these places, the Ukraine army has been decimated over the last few months.<br/><br/>The topper is the Seymour Hersh story about secret negotiations being done by Zaluzhnyi and Russian chief of the general staff Gerasimov. It is a nonsense story, but clearly planted by people in Washington for some reason. It suggests there is something going on behind the curtain in Washington and that may be tied to the events in Ukraine. Instead of things coming to a head in late 2024 they may be about to go nuts to kick off the new year. 2024 is going to be wild.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Seymour Substack <br/><br/>* Foreign Summary <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="It would take a heart of stone to not laugh at the panic that has gripped our elite monasteries over the issue of Israel. The figurehead of Penn just resigned, because she was found to be insufficiently obedient to the Zionist cause. Like Richard Nixon, she fell victim to a changing set of rules. A year ago, it was okay to let brown people harass white people on campus. Now, certain brown people are not allowed to harass specific white people. Mx. Magill did not get the memo.<br/><br/>The mask dropping over the last two months has led to a whole lot of noticing. Not only are people noticing the grotesque double standards, but they are also noticing the grotesque hypocrisy in the public square. Many of the people demanding action over a few Jewish kids getting their feelings hurt roared with laughter when the same crowd was physically assaulting white kids. Of course, people are noticing the special set of rules for certain people when it comes to truth telling.<br/><br/>As an aside, I have noticed that the SPLC crowd has taken up anti-Zionism. The same people who spent their days trying to dox people for spicy memes on Twitter are now down with the anti-Zionist cause. These people are simpletons who go whichever way the wind blows, but I look forward to seeing the Zionists train their sights on these people. A whole lot of people who spent their lives chasing imaginary Nazis are going to be labeled antisemites by the people who underwrote their operation.<br/><br/>Not having a dog in any of this, I am enjoying it. I noted on Twitter that the figurehead at Penn was one of the people trying to get Amy Wax fired for the sin of having Jared Taylor speak to her class. This is proof that the universe has a sense of humor. It is the problem of the American Left in a nutshell. The Left is defined as antiwhite now, so the only role for white liberals is to chase the imaginary Nazis and white supremacists, but many of them are actually Jewish.

    desc="Having spent Saturday preparing the new house for painting, I decided to take the easy way out this week and talk about the gays. No, not those gays or even \"gays\" but the life and times of Harvard president Claudine Gay. I found her most recent resume, which is about ten years old. The great scrubbing of her life from the internet is underway, so getting any of this stuff will soon be impossible. Everyone is focusing on her alleged antisemitism, plagiarism, and immunity from these claims due to her intersectional score. All of those are worth attention, especially the last item, as it blows a giant hole in the left-wing project. Everyone in this sort of politics assumes they are at the top of the progressive stack. They tell themselves that they are all equal as they exact revenge on whitey, but that is not the case. There is another angle here. Harvard and the people running it is where the next generation of managerial elites are decanted. The job of Mx. Gay and the rest are to get these students ready to assume positions in the elite, so they can run the leviathan, which includes the administrative class and Dirt People. Some portion of these novices will need to know how to run things and keep the system going. When you look at the resume of Mx. Gay, or the CV’s of any of these people, what you find is a life lived in avoidance of the world outside the campus. Mx. Gay would end up living under a bridge if she were barred from the college campus. She has no skills that translate to anywhere outside the academy. Therefore, she has not skills, experience, or wisdom to pass along to the students Harvard is training to run the world. What is happening to our elite colleges is a variation of the late Jerry Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracies, which goes like this. \"In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely.\" Our elite colleges are run by people who only care about keeping the flow of money coming so they can maintain an alternative reality.  To do that they sell credentials that used to be tied to merit, but now they act like the Nobles of the Robe, raising money for their weird court by selling diplomas, which are something like the Letters of Patent sold by the French aristocracy to raise funds.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>Affirmative Action Resume <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I must admit that I am torn at the start of the election season. On the one hand, it promises to be an epic circus that will provide hours of cheap thrills. On the other hand, it means I will have to talk and write about it and that will not be much fun. I noticed that whenever I engage with conventional politics, I start to get angry, and my mind is consumed with dark thoughts. Luckily, I have enough projects going that I will struggle to keep up with all of it.<br/><br/>I will go out on a limb and predict that Haley will have a dreadful night on Tuesday. She reminds me of that lunatic Howard Dean a few cycles ago. The media loved him, but his campaign was all paid volunteers from out of state. The locals had no interest, and they do the voting. That and Haley is relying on Democrats to strategically vote for her as a way to harm Trump and the Republicans. That strategy rarely works, so I say she finishes third.<br/><br/>The guy to watch is DeSantis. He has put all his eggs in the Iowa basket, so if he finished third it is over for him, but even a distant second could be enough to end his run. He has no campaign in New Hampshire, so he needs a big night in Iowa. If that does not happen and he drops out, does he endorse Trump or does he endorse Haley? Just for entertainment value, I hope he endorses Haley. Ann Coulter will have a stroke.

    desc="The New Hampshire primary is upon us. I remember a time when this was like carnival in winter in that it drew in the media and all sorts of freaks and weirdos. For a week it was a big party. It has not had that vibe for a long time. In 2020 the Democrats were miserable over Bernie Sanders so there was no fun for them and Trump was unopposed. You also had the Covidians out ululating in the streets at anyone not wearing their underwear around their head.<br/><br/>In 2016 it was a thing as Trump needed a win to establish himself as the favorite. Even so, it had lost a lot of its luster as the state has changed due to crackpots from Massachusetts having flooded into the state over the last decades. That and the regime was in a full-blown panic over Trump rising to the top of the Republican field. Some people had fun in the New Hampshire primary, but the people who controlled the mood of the country were not having fun.<br/><br/>A big part of New Hampshire losing its festival atmosphere is the fact that our politics have been immiserated by scolds and lunatics. It is tough to have a good time when you know these crackpots saying and doing loony things will have real power. Of course, the scolds and lunatics are always on the lookout for people having fun. Within living memory politics was often fun, but now it is never fun, even when the bad guys do not get what they want from the ballot box.<br/><br/>That said, it will be interesting to see how the regime reacts to what is looking like a bad night for the anti-Trump forces. Normal people have assumed Trump would roll through the primary, but the regime and regime toadies in the media really thought they were chipping away at his support. Once Haley flames out this week, the usual suspects will be rending their garments and gnashing their teeth at what will be a surprise to no one but them.<br/><br/>The thing I am watching is the end of the DeSantis campaign. He has pulled all of his ads in New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. He is in New Hampshire doing some events, but he has single digit support in the state. There is a good shot he quits the race after Tuesday. The question then is will he endorse Trump? I will blow a funny fuse if he endorses Haley, but my bet is he does not endorse anyone and just goes back to Florida.<br/><br/>No politician does anything without a scheme. Not endorsing Trump would signal to the party that he is still in the anti-Trump camp. It would suggest his people still think Trump gets removed and he can make another run at the nomination. If he endorses Trump, even unenthusiastically, it suggests that behind the scenes the smart money is thinking the lawfare is not going to work. There are other signs that regime elements are reconsidering that narrative.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* New Hampshire<br/><br/>* Zelensky <br/><br/>* Science! <br/><br/>* Israel <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The Texas border crisis came and went without incident. It was one of those rare times when the regime showed some political savvy. Instead of confronting Texas and risking the bad images that would come from such a confrontation, they chose to ignore it. There were no votes to gain from a confrontation and no votes to lose by ignoring it. They have instructed the media to ignore it, so the whole thing will be forgotten by Monday.<br/><br/>It is a great example of the power to ignore that is the media’s greatest power. They can whip up a lynch mob against a target, but that target gets attention and maybe positive attention. Trump exists largely due to the media’s obsession with the man. On the other hand, if they ignore someone or something, the public also ignores it. That has been their best weapon on the great replacement. The regime ignores the issue, leaving it to people they label as cranks.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see what happens with the immigration bill as a result. Both parties strongly prefer open borders, but it is becoming a problem. House Republicans seem to think they have a winning issue, so they are holding the line for now. Again, most would live nothing more than to fink on their voters, because they live to fink. The Speaker of the House knows that doing nothing is finking, but it looks like he is not finking, which helps con the rubes back home.<br/><br/>They also have the Ukraine money tangled up in this, so the pressure will be on to do something so the money laundering machine called Project Ukraine does not run dry. Given that the people working on this problem are either evil or finks, I fully expect them to arrive at a solution that finks on the voters and it a truly evil compromise. The lesson of my adult life is that you cannot be too cynical about the people who pretend to run the political system.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Immigration<br/><br/>* Election Stuff<br/><br/>* Death To Scum! <br/><br/>* The White Out <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Something I did not cover in the show is the decision in Oregon to bar ten Republicans from running for reelection because they have been accused of mean words. Oregon, of course, is run by kooks, so this is not a surprise, but it is another example where we seem to be heading for divorce. How can people who want a civilized society, based around rights, exist in the same society with people who reject those ideas and instead demand a secular theocracy?<br/><br/>In the past I have compared it to a negotiation in which one party opens with the demand that they get to kill the other party. Where is the middle ground here? Will the second party agree to losing a leg or maybe take a severe beating that puts him in the hospital? Obviously, the second party would never agree to make any deal, unless he was a conservative,. A normal person would see the danger of any association with the other party and prepare for war.<br/><br/>That is what you see all over now. The New York court system, for example, is a lawless place dominated by anti-white lunatics. The illegals who beat a cop on the street were let free because the cop stands for whiteness in the pea sized brain of the black prosecutor. How can a white person or even the nonwhite cops exist in the same society with someone who thinks this is acceptable?

All the worst people spend two weeks preparing to do their worst during the broadcast and they do not disappoint. The game has been enveloped by ads and social commentary from people who should not be allowed to have opinions. Then you have the halftime show, which became ridiculous a long time ago.<br/><br/>For the longest time, at least twenty years, I watched little of the game because I was part of hosting a big Superbowl party. It took all day to get things ready and then most of the game was spent feeding people and socializing, often with people I would see once a year. I might catch some of the halftime show and the end of the game, but most of it was lost on me. It turned out to be the best way to consume this product.<br/><br/>We ended the annual party and so I had the chance to watch the whole game from start to finish and I was shocked at the terribleness of it. The runup was full of jibber-jabber from men who had taken too many blows to the head. The game was okay, but the endless breaks and the insipid ads in those breaks made it hard for me to watch.

    desc="Lots of Russia news and Trump news this week. Trump was just fined a gorillion dollars for the crime of not defrauding his bankers. The death of Alexy Navalny is also Trump’s fault. You see, Trump and Putin are of one mind, the mind of the devil, against whom the good people are arrayed in the end times battle of this age.  That sounds bonkers, but they have Nikki Haley out there saying Trump killed Navalny, so while it is bonkers, it is a real thing in this age.<br/><br/>There is a link in the notes below to an interview with a French intelligence officer. Like Marines, no one ever really leaves the intelligence community and remains alive. He is retired from active work, it seems, so he occupies his time telling people about the shadowy world of the spy game. His comments about Navalny and how the United States grooms troublemakers to insert into the politics of countries on the neocon target list is interesting. America is what the Soviets used to be.<br/><br/>I did not mention it in the show as I just thought about it, but to understand the Navalny situation just think about the Nikki Haley situation. Like Haley, Navalny was a creation of the neocons and their extensive network of donors and operatives. Like Haley, Navalny never had a base of support, outside of the small number of people who hated Putin. Haley exists because she is willing to be the face of TDS and Navalny existed because he was willing to be the public face of Putin hatred.<br/><br/>Politics is a rougher game in Russia than the US. When Haley reaches her expiry date, she will be given a no-show job that pays well for a woman with no utility. Navalny, like other catspaws used by Washington around the world, ended up in a cage and then died. This is good news as far as the neocons are concerned as they need a way to distract from events in Ukraine. Now they can paint Navalny as Russia’s Nelson Mandela.

    desc="Sunday was a rough day, so the show was put off in order to get some much-needed rest and take care of some work stuff. Having two jobs is always a challenge, but when you throw in a renovation project and a move, the schedule gets tight. I have been burning the candle at both ends for a few months, even more than usual, so I needed to take a break. Saturday, I put in a wood stove, which is not an easy thing to wrestle into a house, so I was extra tired.<br/><br/>It worked out for the better, as the topics in the news today were much better than what was in the feed Sunday, so it makes for a better show. It also ties into with the post today. The bizarre stuff in the media regarding Trump makes for a good show. It reminds me of 2016 when I was writing about Trump every week, because the media and the conservatives were having a weird new meltdown over Trump every week. The 2024 Summer of Trump is going to be just as wild.<br/><br/>In fact, it may be worse. I do not see how they un-ring the bell with the indictment stuff and I do not see Trump dropping out, so that means we will have a serious crisis. The crazies have committed themselves to this course and they will not be dissuaded. At the same time, Trump is turning into a genuine dissident around whom people are rallying. This is not 2016 where Trump support was a warning shot to the political elites.

    desc="I did not want to do the whole show on the leaked audio of the German officials plotting to attack Russia, but I could easily have done an hour on it. It is one of those things that reveals so much it is hard to know where to begin. It is one one of those rare peaks inside the private world of the Cloud People, one that confirms a lot of what we have suspected. The big confirmation is that the people who rule over us are dangerously stupid.<br/><br/>In addition to being stupid, what is striking is just how comfortable they are with lying. The point of the call was to devise a plan where Germany could launch missile attacks on Russia but do so in a way that would make it look like the Ukrainians did it. That way they could pretend that they are not actually at war with Russia. The casual way in which they discuss this scheme suggests these are men who are not only comfortable with lying, but it is a central part of their identity.<br/><br/>The other thing I did not mention is the general crappiness of Western wonder weapons. The mechanics of making these weapons work is astonishing. These missiles cost over a million a copy but require months of planning in order to fire one of them. Even crazier is the fact that they know they can only use them once or twice before the Russians unriddle how to defeat them. It is no wonder that the Ukrainians say that Western weapons are only good for parades.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Trump Stuff<br/><br/>* Morons I <br/><br/>* Morons II <br/><br/>* Kooks <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Having been unplugged for the better part of a week, I did not follow the news very much. Before calling it a night I would scan Twitter, but that was it. I saw some clips of Biden’s State of the Union speech, which looked kind of dark to me. He looked angry in that old man at the nursing home sort of way, which is rather sad. They juice him up with Adderall for these things, which I am told is why he comes off so angry, especially as the speech wears on.<br/><br/>It is also why he seemed so out of it the last few months. The way this works is they juice him up, but once the drugs wear off, he returns to his foggy-brained state. The more times you give him the hot shot, the longer the foggy period lasts and the worse it gets, so they must be trying to conserve what little he has left for these events. How this will work in a campaign is a mystery. Maybe they just assume the press will run cover and they can keep him under lock and key.<br/><br/>I keep waiting for the scenery to topple over in this act. Either Biden has a public episode where it is clear that he is out of it, or he starts talking gibberish. This ridiculous show they are putting on with this old man cannot go on much longer. On the other hand, I did not think he would last this long. I suffer from the bias common with normal people and that is I assume that lunacy has an expiry date.

    desc="I remain skeptical about Trump winning the election this November, but eight months out it is looking like he could win the election, which is not something I thought would be the case. There is a long way to go, of course, so we cannot assume anything. The change in tone we are seeing in the media, however, suggests that the people who actually run things may be softening on Trump. Maybe they are just busy with other things at the moment, but it does feel like something has changed.<br/><br/>The panic in Europe over Project Ukraine is another clue. They are worried that Trump winning will not only mean the end of money for Ukraine, but that Trump may pull troops from Europe. Presumably they think this because they are hearing it from their handlers in Washington. It could just be a scare tactic to get them to step up while the Kagan cult scrambles for a new plan. It could also be a sign that the winds of change are blowing through the political class.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we saw these respites when Trump was in office. The crazies would take a break, only to come back even crazier. It could be that they are resting up for a summer of lunacy. Getting Antifa and BLM back together will take time. These court cases are all stalled for one reason or another, so they need to get those going again.

    desc="Normal people always struggle to accept that the Cloud People really believe the things they say. There must be some other reason for what we see. Money and power are the most popular explanations, even though the people in charge have all the money and power. These are explanations that make sense to normal people, so people stick with them despite what they see. Normal people cannot accept that their rulers are as crazy as they appear.<br/><br/>This post from Keith Woods is a good example. He cannot accept that the West was behind the terrorist attack in Moscow because he cannot see the benefit. His first mistake is in assuming he understands how they see their interests. He just assumes they must think like he thinks and therefore assess their interests as he would assess their interests. The second mistake is the unwillingness to accept that these people are as crazy as their behavior indicates.<br/><br/>This post from Amy Klobuchar is a good starting point for understanding our rulers. In the world in which she spends all of her life, she and her fellow actors did the people a favor by passing a spending bill riddled with degenerate things like money for torturing children. In their world they are the heroes for showing up and performing their lines in the middle of the night.

    desc="Someone in the comments on yesterday’s post said, “It is really had to accept, but we are ruled by a gang of retards.” I think that is a good summary of the age. Americans are struggling to come to terms with the fact that our system does not work as advertised and it may not work at all because the credentialed people running it are too dumb to do it. They are good at gaming the system, but they are not good at doing anything useful to keep the system running.<br/><br/>You see it in the crime stats story that I cover toward the end of the show. We can no longer rely on the crime figures because the people reporting the figures are too stupid to do the basic tasks required to get accurate numbers and they are too dishonest to do it even if they had the brains to work the knobs and levers of the reporting mechanism. That last part is critical. Even knowing that the numbers are now junk, they will shamelessly claim that crime is improving.<br/><br/>That is the thing that will eventually break the system. There is a limit as to how much lying a population can tolerate before it reaches a breaking point. Everything is a lie in America. Lying has become the coin of the realm. Even when the truth would be the best course, these people will produce an outlandish lie to tell. At some point, people just get so sick of the lying they begin to hate the system that selects for these outlandish liars.<br/><br/>You see some of this happening with the Israel – Gaza war. Much of the anti-Israel pushback I see on Twitter is in response to the lying. People see the images of destroyed apartment blocks and then a pro-Israel shill responds with blatant lies about October 7th that have been debunked a dozen times, as if there can ever be a justification for deliberately blowing up civilians. The pro-Israel lie machine is having the exact opposite effect that is intended.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Israel  <br/><br/>* Ukraine  <br/><br/>* WW3 <br/><br/>* Evil Spirits <br/><br/>* Fake Crime Data <br/><br/>* The Diddler <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One thing that I forgot to mention last night when I recorded this is there might be another game afoot with this Iran – Israel tit-for-tat. The Biden admin might be putting on a show of trying to prevent a war between Israel and Iran. They wanted the Iranians to think Washington does not want war and will put pressure on Israel to not respond. This would tempt the Iranians into a measured response, retaliating in a measured way, thinking this will be the end of it.<br/><br/>One reason Washington might want this is chaos could keep them in the game. There is no way Israel will be cut off, so if there is a regional war the American war machine will be sent to support Israel by attacking Iranian assets. This will send energy prices to the moon. The country most effected by this will be China which is a massive energy monster now. Sure, it will raise prices in the West, but the excuse is those dastardly Iranians, not the Biden admin.<br/><br/>This might look like 4-D chess, but it is a piece with how the neocons have run American foreign policy over the last half century. They always put chaos in the set of options. Chaos is their last resort in the Ukraine war, which in that case is terrorism. The Crocus terror attack was a taste of what is likely to come after the Ukraine army fails. An Israel – Iran war would throw the Middle East into chaos and chaos often presents new opportunities.<br/><br/>Trump did this in his 2016 campaign. Every other week he would say something to outrage the media, thus creating an atmosphere of chaos. He usually came out looking like a champ because he is a guy who is comfortable in a world of chaos. Creating chaos is a way of resetting the board by forcing everyone to reset their strategy. That could be what the neocons are up to with this game of pretending to want peace, but really hoping for war.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Iran Strikes Israel<br/><br/>* The 4-D Chess<br/><br/>* Changing Of The Guard<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Something I did not mention in the show is the role spite seems to have played in the long Ukraine war funding boondoggle that terminated yesterday. If you look inside the bill, you will find that they included money for NGO’s that facilitate illegal immigration into the country. These are the “Christian” groups that help settle violent migrants into your neighborhood. This has nothing to do with Ukraine, but was included in the Ukraine bill, rather than the Israel or Taiwan bills, for two reasons.<br/><br/>One reason they deliberately put it in the Ukraine bill is Johnson held up this bill because he wanted a bill passed to address the border issues. That pissed off the lizard people. How dare he make demands of them like this. They needed to make sure to send a message to whoever is the next “leader” of the opposition party that this will not be tolerated. If you dare try to bargain with the lizard people, the deal will get worse until you surrender.<br/><br/>The other reason they put it in the Ukraine bill is they knew it would get all the scrutiny from the chattering classes, so it would be spotted right away. The lizard people wanted you filthy Dirt People to see what happened. It is a way for them to rub our noses in it. It seems contradictory, but underneath all the chanting about “our democracy” is the iron fist of autocracy. They want you to know that your opinion means nothing. They are in charge, and they decide.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Weekend Boondoggle<br/><br/>* Death To The GOP<br/><br/>* REP Act<br/><br/>* Trump Trial<br/><br/>* RFK Problem <br/><br/>* Fake and Lazy <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="My plan was to spend the weekend writing about the VDare conference, but I was visited by a terrible case of Ebola Friday night that kept me out of commission until now. I felt fine Friday night at the kick-off reception, but when I got home Ebola hit me. No doubt someone at the event was carrying germs that decided to attack me. There were people from all over, which means they flew to the event and that means they were mixing it up with all sorts of strange germs along the way.<br/><br/>I rarely get conventional colds of the flu, but I will get stuck with a 24-hour bug when I fly and that is what must have happened this weekend. I got home at around 9:30 PM on Friday and by midnight I was having the Naked Lunch experience. The last thirty-six hours were what it must be like to spend a weekend in an opium den. Like the Russian army in World War II, my immune system rallied to beat back the forces of darkness last night and I am back in the world again.<br/><br/>It is a shame as I was looking forward to listening to the talks on Saturday. They had a good group of speakers, but I was in no condition to attend. That and it is never a good idea to go to a public event when sick, especially one where there are old people. Giving everyone else a chance to enjoy your germs is a terrible thing to do, so it was for the best that I did the Howard Hughes act.

    desc="Looks like this will be another summer of protests. These campus protests will surely be redirected to the public square in the coastal cities, especially Washington and New York, in the hope that they create maximum chaos. It seems counterintuitive, given that the Democrats hold the White House, but the managerial class assumes they win when normie is rustled. They are the side of order, so periods of disorder are good for their side.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the issue of bourgeois decadence. The boys and girls that dominate the college campus suffer from arrested development in that they have no real responsibilities and no prospects for ever having them, so they are free to indulge in performative misbehavior. They know nothing serious will happen to them, as long as they avoid certain taboos or causing bodily harm. These spring protests are just a lark that kills time until finals.<br/><br/>All that said, there is an anti-Israel element among the people we call the left that has been dormant since the Bush years, but it seems to be coming to the surface now. Anti-Zionism has always been a left-wing cause and mostly a Jewish cause. This strikes people as implausible, because the antisemites convince everyone that Jews are a monolith, but that is not reality. Left-wing Jews are anti-Zionist because they are anti-nationalist.<br/><br/>In the end, the correct side in this stuff is the sideline. None of these people are our people and they would lock shields in a heartbeat for the chance to hurl white people into the void, so the best course is to root for both sides to escalate. This is the college campus version of the Iran – Iraq war. In a perfect world, both sides are deploying tactical nukes on all of the elite college campuses this summer.

    desc="The promised wild summer has started as the news is almost all about Trump and the panic the worst people experience when they think about Trump. That last part promises to become more acute as the Trump rallies get going this summer. Trump managed to pull an estimated eighty thousand people to a rally in Wildwood New Jersey. A good example is this story about the rally, which quickly becomes typical kook lunacy about the show trial in New York.<br/><br/>Panic is warranted. New Jersey is a plus-15 Democrat state. That means statewide, Democrats win the state by fifteen points. Biden won the state 57-41 in 2020. In 2016 Clinton won the state by fifteen and in 2008 Obama won by eighteen points. For Trump to draw that sort of crowd in a solidly Democrat state suggests at the minimum, the anti-kook forces are more intense now. The non-kook population is getting tired of the kooks.<br/><br/>The speech itself had an interesting tone. Someone on Twitter compared it to McCarthy’s Wheeling speech, in which McCarthy warned at a Lincoln Day event that “we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and Christianity.” This was the speech where he held up papers claiming to have a list of “homegrown traitors” and the ADL assumed he meant them. Trump talked about subversives who are destroying the country from within.<br/><br/>Trump will never win New Jersey, but what this event suggests is there a crusader tone to this election that was absent in the last one and only a flicker in 2016. People voted Trump in 2016, in part, to send a message, but this time people seem to sense that he is leading a holy crusade. The regime is beyond repair, so the time for warnings has passed. That is a different thing entirely from what drove people to vote Trump in 2016 and 2020.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Tax Man Cometh <br/><br/>* Shitlib Fantasy Hour <br/><br/>* Brown Tide  <br/><br/>* Old & Broke     <br/><br/>* The Future Of Democracy <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Majority Minority"
    desc="There is plenty of talk about the demographic changes happening in America, but not much thought about where it is headed. Some people mention the fact that the country will be majority-minority in a generation, but no one likes to think about that so that is as far as it ever gets. The people in charge seem to think America will be Brazil but without the favellas and kidnapping industry.<br/><br/>The fact is the social and political structures that have defined America cannot survive the demographic changes that are coming fast. The main reason for that is the majority population, once it becomes just another minority population, cannot continue to think like a majority population. The majority will no longer be able to swap the good of the whole for the good of their group.<br/><br/>Everything about America is the result of the majority population swapping their interest for the interest of the country. This altruism works only when the interests of the country are seen to align with the interest of the dominant majority, which is a thing that comes naturally when the majority is near ninety percent. Once that majority shrinks down to nearly fifty percent this perception collapses.<br/><br/>This is what we see happening all around us. The majority looks around and see nothing but angry minorities, both unhappy with their position in society and totally unwilling to sacrifice anything for the good of the whole. The campus protests, for example, are just another sign that we have reached the tragedy of the commons phase of the demographic collapse of the white majority.<br/><br/>That is the show this week. It is a rumination on how majorities naturally see themselves and how minorities naturally see themselves. Democracy can only work in a majoritarian society. Once a democratic society devolves into a majority-minority society, minoritarianism takes over and democracy is no longer possible. What comes next is from a set of choices most do not relish.<br/><br/>This Week's Show<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>* Majority & Minority<br/><br/>* Majority Attitudes<br/><br/>* Minority Attitudes<br/><br/>* Majority Minority<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Normally I do this show using the Memeorandum site as it is a useful news aggregator, and it is in a handy outline form. Sometimes I will look at Drudge, which I hardly do anymore. When was the last time anyone mentioned Drudge? It really is amazing to think that a decade ago it was the go-to site for what was happening in the news and now it may as well have tumbleweeds on it. When was the last time Matt Drudge was seen in public?<br/><br/>This lack of relevance reminded me of something I saw the other day about how Drudge got the scoop of the century during the Clinton years. This was before social media was a thing and before most people were online, but powerful people were pushing Drudge. He was a frequent guest of B-list talk radio programs like Mary Matelin and Michael Medved. Why they would have an obscure website guy as a guest never made any sense until he suddenly got the Lewinsky scoop.<br/><br/>Anyway, someone on Twitter, now stupidly called X, pointed out that the reason anyone knew about Clinton raping interns was that the Israelis tried to use the information to blackmail Clinton and when that failed they gave it to Drudge. It suggests that Lewinsky was recruited by her home country’s intel agency to exploit a well-known vulnerability. It also suggests that Drudge was made famous because he got intel from his home country’s intel agency.<br/><br/>That raises a lot of questions about the outpouring of support for Israel from every Republican politician and most of the Democrats. Maybe the reason that a guy like Tom Cotton cannot shut up about Israel is that he has secrets he wants to remain secret. It is also a reminder that our news media does no honest reporting and relies entirely on information handed to it by governments. That means everything in the news is there because powerful people want it in the public domain.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Death To Them All <br/><br/>* Jerry Springer Nation <br/><br/>* Loyal Soldier <br/><br/>* VP Watch <br/><br/>* Forever The Past <br/><br/>* Rich Friends <br/><br/>* Laser Penis <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I must confess that even though I knew the Trump verdict long before the trial began, I still found the whole thing a bit depressing. No matter how black-pilled you are about the country, there remains a flicker of hope that the fever will break, and sanity will return. Events like this are a terrible reminder that hope is a foolish thing in an age like ours. Instead of planning for the worst and hoping for the best it is “plan for the worst and expect it to be even worse.”<br/><br/>That said, this is a good test of whether the regime can control the system. You get the sense that even the regime toadies know this was a bad move. Letting low-level morons do stuff like this just discredits the regime. There is no upside to this. If the cucks remove Trump from the ballot, it is a disaster for regime credibility. If this idiot judge puts Trump in jail, then he is even a bigger martyr, and half the country starts thinking about revolution.<br/><br/>The Biden White House should be able to lean on this idiot judge so that he gives Trump a fine or maybe probation of some sort. The regime toadies get to call Trump a felon, but the process trundles on, keeping the masses trusting the system. The trial is just another bit of the circus that surrounds Trump and maybe costs him some support at the fringes. The argument against him becomes, “It is always a circus around this guy. Do you want four more years of this?”<br/><br/>It is not a great plan, but it saves enough face to keep the white middle-class thinking they can vote their way out of trouble. This reminds me of something I said about Bill Clinton in the 1990’s. Clinton was never smart, but he was clever. Smart people know how to avoid trouble, while clever people know how to wriggle out of trouble. Clever people run our system, but in order to show their cleverness they create these problems for themselves.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* An Angry Rant<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="This week is a bit of a break from the Trump stuff, as most of what is in the news about Trump is from C-level media zombies. This is holiday time for Washington, so the content creation is left to the minor league staffers. Things will pick up after this week as we ramp up to the great debate between Biden and Trump which is scheduled for the 27th. I continue to think they booked this debate early so they have time to play the old switcheroo with Biden.<br/><br/>Looking at Drudge there is plenty of international stuff worth discussing. We seem to be reaching an inflection point in American foreign policy. The Biden people seem to be preparing to shift gears in Ukraine and maybe even Israel. Meantime, the Europeans are carrying on like before because they have not received new orders from the home office. Of course, it is also election season in parts of Europe, so they have to worry about the peasant revolt at the ballot box.<br/><br/>I posted a video on Telegram yesterday about this, but I am getting the sense that we are approaching the end of something. The old energy driving the populist revolt is running low, but the kook energy opposing it is also running low. Maybe it is just summer, but it feels like everyone has run out of poo to fling at their favorite bogeyman. Who knows, maybe this case of madness has finally burned itself out and we are headed to another interregnum like after the 1970’s.<br/><br/>I doubt that is the case as this is a different country now, so maybe we are in a lull before some new storm of lunacy descends upon us. Perhaps that kook judge will send Trump to jail and that sets off some unimagined consequences. Maybe the debate will be a planned disaster and they swap out Biden for Gavin Newsome. Regardless, it does feel like we are either at the end of something or maybe waiting for some new thing to happen.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* The Ruskies <br/><br/>* The Kook <br/><br/>* The Jews <br/><br/>* The Huns <br/><br/>* The Krauts <br/><br/>* The Aliens <br/><br/>* The Balls <br/><br/>* The Swallow <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Video Experiment #1"
    desc="I have been fiddling around a bit with video since the end of last year with the thought of maybe adding that to the content collection. The trouble is I know nothing about video editing, and I have not had the time to learn, so the few efforts at doing video were straight to Telegram or straight to the trash bin. Video editing is a completely different set of skills from audio editing and much more frustrating. The main challenge is figuring out how to make short videos that can be posted on SubscribeStar because they have a low limit on video size. That means trial and error to get the time and quality right. The original file for this video was a gig, which is about three times too big for what is allowed here. Let me know how it looks. I had to reduce the quality quite a bit, but it still looked okay on my desktop, but we shall see how it looks here. I am torn on the video stuff. The cool kids do videos, but most of the videos I see look like hostage tapes, but maybe my tastes are not aligned with the world. The ones I like are the ones where the guy walks around talking and maybe showing some things he sees on his walk or even doing the selfie stick thing. One of the Duran guys does his daily videos as he wanders around Cyprus or Athens. The other idea I have is to do short presentation videos on certain topics. Maybe five- or ten-minute presentations on the stuff that is core to this thing. They would be best for a free audience so they can be passed to the curious. That is more work than it looks as you have to put together the images and video and then time it all out with an audio tract. So far, it feels like there is more work to it than this sort of video. For now, all of this will be for the green door club. That way if it is terrible, the world does not see my terrible mistakes. On the other hand, if after some trial and error I decide to not do this, I do not have people telling me I should stop writing and focus my attention on doing videos that I do not want to do. I still get e-mails from people telling me that no one reads anymore, and I should focus on doing podcasts.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="The madness is officially upon us. The debate is this Thursday which means the election will be the only topic in the media for the next four months. Everyone with any sense knows the debate will be a circus as the moderators run cover for Biden by attacking Trump the whole night. It will be the old “three on one liberal fun” that defined chat shows in the 1980’s. They would have a panel of lefties and one righty, who spent all of his time defending himself from the goons.<br/><br/>Conservatives always went along with these rigged debates because conservatives exist to kiss the feet of their masters, but Trump does not have that excuse. He should have insisted on a fair format where he and Biden ask one another questions. The moderator’s job is to turn off the mic when one side goes too long on an answer. Alternatively, he could have insisted the debate be on Rumble or Twitter and each side picked a questioner.<br/><br/>It is a good reminder that Trump is a man of his time, and that time was when people got their politics from television news. Maybe it makes sense since old people are the biggest voting bloc, but the debate will just be a shit show. The two moderators are kooks who will no doubt spend the night calling Trump a felon, while Trump makes faces and Biden stares off into space. There is simply no upside for Trump or any Republican in doing these things.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Trump will announce his running mate this week and he or she will be in the audience for the debate. The betting is he picks a woman, but Trump is old school, so I think he picks a black. Like most white people in his age group he thinks with a little more worship, the black people will forgive them and all will be right with the world. It really is a weird fetish.

    title="Video Experiment #2"
    desc="One main reason I have avoided doing video to this point is I suspect the amount of effort required to produce minimally acceptable video content is much higher than what is required to produce minimally acceptable audio content. The phrase \"minimally acceptable\" here is purely subjective and that judgement lies with me. I try to avoid doing anything that I do not think meets my minimal standards of acceptability. For example, in the case of the podcast, the quality should be good enough for the listener to be able to hear everything, and not be distracted by random sounds. Nothing worse than listening to a show with dogs barking in the background or the audio cutting in and out, so I make sure to avoid that stuff. At the same time, podcasts should not be over-produced as I think they lose their authenticity. Too good and they sound fake to me.Video is a different animal. If I am going to watch even a short video, I want to be able to see everything clearly like I would with a professionally produced video. It is what I am used to and what I assume most people are used to expecting. That does not mean movie quality, but the expectations are higher than with a podcast. The video and audio should be close to the professional level and that means more effort to produce them.What I have found with video is you need more prep time to do a video than to do an audio show because of the limits of editing. When recording the podcast, I often talk myself into a dead end and then stop, go back to some convenient restarting point, cut out the jibber-jabber and continue recording from there. Once in a while you can probably tell I clipped a section here or there, but it is never very obvious.With video, this is not easy. For starters, the video editing software is all bloatware so doing simple tasks is a chore. Cutting and splicing video is also far more difficult because it is so much easier to see the edits. Then you have the issue of matching the audio to the video if you are shooting video of yourself talking about what you are seeing. Video editing comes with many more hurdles than audio editing.Probably the biggest challenge for me is the language. I still only know about ten percent of the lingo used in audio editing. I have had no reason to learn what a Reverse High Filter EQ Back Straddle Twist edit does. There is no need for me to know this stuff as I am not producing classical music tracks. I just need to filter out ambient noises, my \"ums and uhs\", and the occasional bellowing of Devil Cat.With video, there is a whole new language and none of it makes much sense to me. For example, the simple act of shrinking a video by a few seconds so that it goes from ten minutes and ten seconds to exactly ten minutes apparently requires a trip to Mordor to fetch a special ring of power. Video editing is a jobs program and as such the video editing guild has made it as opaque as humanly possible with esoteric language.Anyway, the plan is to entertain myself learning this stuff until I either reach the minimally acceptable level or I find a new hobby. I have recently discovered the world of LED track lighting, which is something I plan to use in the basement project. It comes with lots of fiddly gadgets and the chance to electrocute myself. Maybe I can combine video editing with the art of dodging stray electrons while wiring up LED lighting.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="Lots of fake news claiming that there are debates behind the scenes about forcing Joe Biden to retire so the party can install a living candidate. Most of these stories are fantasies cooked up by the same people who gave us every other media fraud. Right now, everyone knows the narrative is about the debate and what should be the reaction to it, so they are churning out appropriate copy. If the narrative shifts, then their “sources” will suddenly have different stories to tell.<br/><br/>There are two competing claims here. One claim says that the people in the hollowed-out volcano plotted this whole thing so they could bump off Biden. They scheduled this early debate, so they had six weeks to force out Biden and then engineer a movement in favor of a replacement. This person will then be crowned at the highly choreographed convention in the middle of August. Biden’s performance was part of the plan to pull the old switcheroo.<br/><br/>The other theory is this just happened because the people running the administration are incapable of second order thinking. Not only are they incapable of thinking more than one move ahead, but they are also unable to think about anything other than their own desires. In this case, they wanted to get the debate out of the way so they could move onto their campaign against Trump that would not require Biden to do anything more than shuffle around on stage.<br/><br/>The evidence in favor of the former is the unified response from the media. Clearly, word went out to stage the entirely phony shock and awe campaign. None of these people do anything without prior approval from their handlers, so it was planned. On the other hand, this does not contradict the second theory of the crime. It is possible this was a planned hit, but it is also possible that they have not thought about what comes next.<br/><br/>In fact, this is the pattern we see in foreign policy. They never think about what comes next or they just assume what they want will happen as if by magic. The West’s handling of the Ukraine war has been a case study in this form of one-dimensional chess. They dream up a narrative, make the first move and then assume the rest follows. When it fails, they dream up a new narrative. This may be what we are seeing here with Biden. They just assume he steps aside.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Night Of The Living Dead<br/><br/>* Replacing Biden<br/><br/>* Chevron<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Biden watch is in its second week. Maybe they should bring back the gag they used in the 1970’s during the Iran Hostage Crisis. “Biden Held Hostage: Day 13” and then have the usual chatterbots repeat the things they keep saying over and over about Biden’s problems. It is a good reminder of just how far down the toilet the media has gone. Fifty years ago, the television media would say bad things about a Democratic president who was a screw up.<br/><br/>Last week, Ross Douthat wrote a column in which he contemplated the reality of the modern president, which probably serves no real purpose to the functioning of the machine. He makes some obvious points but then quotes Curtis Yarvin and his brain then falls out of his head and the rest of his column devolves into nonsense. This is the risk of reading Yarvin. Your brain cells begin to die at an alarming rate, mostly as an act of suicide in order to avoid reading Yarvin.<br/><br/>The thing is the job of president has been ceremonial for a long time. Obviously, Biden is a vegetable and has been for most of his term. Under Trump, the system simply adapted to do what it wanted despite his efforts to do otherwise. Obama famously worked only a few hours a day. He never read his briefing books. His job was to perform the speaking role. Bush was a figurehead. Even Clinton complained about not having any real power.<br/><br/>The last president to hold real power and use it was probably Nixon, who was run out of town partially on the claim that he had too much power. This is when the managerial revolution entered into the consolidation phase as the separation between the regulatory state, the mass media and the economic elites collapsed with the managerial class taking control of the system. The size of the federal government exploded as a consequence.<br/><br/>My guess is what amounts to the executive committee running the White House is looking at polling and thinking that maybe it does not matter if the public knows Biden is brain dead. They can still do their usual magic with voting in key states and the party continues. The lesson they learned from January 6th is they can contain an insurrection if one occurs. The police state is probably better than they imagined, and the public is far more docile than they feared.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* No Joe Go<br/><br/>* Coping<br/><br/>* Project Bullshit <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="As expected, the conspiracy theories are flying around the internet about the attempt to take out Trump at his Pennsylvania rally. The kooks were the first to have a go at it. Their initial reaction was that it was staged, and Trump was hit with a BB gun. Once it became clear that at least one person was killed, they stuck with the staged hit narrative, but then the proof was how Trump reacted. As of this morning they are still peddling this theory.<br/><br/>It is a downstream consequence of official lying. Like printing up money for the short-term benefit of the state, official lying eventually works at first, but then undermines itself over time to the point where no one believes anything. Joseph de Maistre said, “False opinions are like false money, struck by guilty men then circulated by honest people who perpetuate the crime without knowing.\" Official lies spawn a cottage industry of lying until no one believes anything.<br/><br/>Of course, not everyone is a liar. The hard thumping kooks in the kook media took to their favorite platforms to tell the world that their hatred of Trump and his fans was always real. There have been many posts like this one in the hours after news broke of the assassination attempt. The truth is, most of official Washington agrees with this guy, but they are smart enough to hide it. Most of the people who rule over us think Trump should have been taken out long ago.<br/><br/>You can spot the people who are disappointed the shooter missed, but do not want to make it public, by their relative silence. Jonah Goldberg is a good example. He waited a few hours to post anything then put up this tear-soaked item on Twitter. Whenever these guys put on their “sober face” you know they are lying to you. His mentor, the neocon crank Ben Wattenberg, was famous for playing the sober-minded, avuncular guy who dispassionately agreed with the crazies.<br/><br/>In the end, yesterday should be a good reminder that history often turns on serendipity. An inch or two another way and we are talking about the death of Trump. The good Lord looks out for damn fools and drunks, so maybe in time this will be viewed as the moment the political class dodged the bullet. It is hard to know what would have happened if that bullet found its target, but it is hard to imagine that the trajectory of things would not have veered toward the revolutionary.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Trump The Lion<br/><br/>* This Was Overdue<br/><br/>* Is There A Way Back To Normal?<br/><br/>* The Kooks Never Learn<br/><br/>* Lots Of Normies Got Radical<br/><br/>* Biden Is Safe Now<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The wild week is over. A wild week lies ahead. This appears to be the last gasp at pushing Biden out of the race, given the calendar. The Democratic convention is four weeks away. If they want to have an open convention, then they need a few weeks to put together a candidate list, convince them to lobby for donor support and put together a campaign for the convention. It also takes time to rig the vote, as nothing says democracy like rigging democratic primaries.<br/><br/>It is an interesting bit of scheming. The Biden people are playing for time as they understand the reality of the schedule. At the same time, the anti-Biden people are feverishly planting fake news about Biden in the media, because they understand the calendar too. That means this week will be a frenzy of activity from both sides. They plan to parade Biden around all next week doing campaign events, while the anti-Biden people turn the fake news up to eleven.<br/><br/>The thing to watch is the effort to get the delegates to revolt against Biden at the convention to force him off the ballot and thereby force an open convention. As of now, the “virtual nomination” is set for August 1st. It had been scheduled for last week, but it was delayed. That means the anti-Biden people have this week to convince enough delegates to fink on Biden. They need about 2000 delegates to flip in order to force an open convention.<br/><br/>Of course, no one involved in this effort is thinking past the first move. Even if they can create a revolt among the delegates, it does not mean they get a good result at the convention. Biden will no doubt spend his vast campaign budget to win at the convention. Then you have the fact that the delegates tend to be the hardest of hard thumping crazies. They could decide that it is time to nominate Bernie Sanders to right the wrongs of past primaries.<br/><br/>Please Allah, make this happen.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Nursing Home Joe<br/><br/>* Super Genius Tom Nichols<br/><br/>* Ear-Gate<br/><br/>* The Chaos To Come<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I did not see this story before recording the show, but it would probably make a good show all by itself as it gets to the main problem of the progressive revolution. That is, it violates core assumptions of Western civilization and therefore creates new problems. In the case of novel definitions of marriage and family, the old rules suddenly make little sense. If a marriage is no longer about biology, then family cannot be about biology, but then what is it?<br/><br/>Simply declaring that marriage is now based on unicorn farts does not address the problem of the laws regarding marriage and family being based in biological reality, rather than unicorn farts. The logic of the law says that custody of a child, for example, is determined by biology. The two, and only two, biological parents, one female and one male, are the two options regarding custody unless they are unavailable for some reason.<br/><br/>Upon what basis could a lesbian lover of the biological mother have a claim to custody of the child that trumps the claims of the biological father? The only way this is possible is if biology ceases to matter at all, so that the state takes primary custody of all children and is free to assign them to whomever it likes for whatever reason it likes. This sounds great to the fantasists of progressivism, but it offends nature and the very existence of the human animal.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Dictator Trump <br/><br/>* Vance Versus The Cat Ladies <br/><br/>* The Cucks <br/><br/>* Old Vance/New Vance <br/><br/>* Harris Fakery <br/><br/>* Simulacron-2024 <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One thing I did not cover in the show is the Iran – Israel business. This post in the Times of Israel, which steals the content from a paywalled report in the Daily Telegraph, is interesting mostly because it lines up with something I said when this event happened. That is, there may be more going on here than just a typical Israel assassination. The way Iran is responding is what you would expect if they had internal problems that either caused this or were revealed by it.<br/><br/>Now, the Telegraph article is fake in that they do not have any of the sources they claim to have in the story, but that is another reason it is interesting. The most likely source is MI6, followed by the usual suspects slithering around the Kagan cult. The writer is an Afghan who speaks English, so he surely has connections to Western intelligence. Just about everyone in that part of the world with good English skills has got a paycheck from the West at least once.<br/><br/>That does not mean the claims are all false. They could very well be true, or they could be an effort to create a fog of uncertainty. The New York Times had a fake story about a missile attack that was clearly sourced from the Biden White House. The game is to put a bunch of different versions of this in Western media, all with the same subtext. The Iranian regime has serious internal divisions and with the right amount of effort, they can be toppled.<br/><br/>Perhaps the usual suspects are once again plotting regime change in Iran. They have convinced themselves that Iran is a critical ally to Russia, so a regime change in Iran would harm their ancient enemy and maybe bring the Saudis back into line. It sounds crazy, but compared to their prior crazy narratives it is somewhat reasonable. Starting the process while Biden is a lame duck makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Debate Flap<br/><br/>* The Economy <br/><br/>* Party Dictatorship <br/><br/>* White Guilt <br/><br/>* Weirdos <br/><br/>* Gross <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="It is always tempting to think that whatever you are experiencing is new, but almost everything in this world has happened in every conceivable way. As the old saying goes, there is nothing new under the sun, just new ways of doing it. There are, however, novelties of this age that arise from the fact we are the first virtual civilization. The internet, this alternative reality that for many people has supplanted reality, is a new thing and therefore it brings new experiences.<br/><br/>One of those is the virtual campaign run by the regime for Kamala Harris. For the last three weeks we have been subjected to the greatest gaslighting campaign since the Soviets discovered cinema or the Nazis took power in Germany. All of the regime elements have been enlisted to promote the inevitability of Kamala Harris and Elmer Fudd. Meanwhile, the only mention of her opponent are imaginary tales about him raging to his subordinates down in his bunker.<br/><br/>Proof that the universe has a sense of humor is the fact that the self-proclaimed right-wing influencers are the ones most caught up in this media operation. It makes sense though, as these are people who live online, always looking for the latest thing so they can rush to the head of the line and proclaim themselves the leaders of it. They see this tidal wave of pro-Harris media and they get swept up in it while trying to front run it.<br/><br/>What we are experiencing is a test of sorts. Can a regime with near total control of the media organs brainwash enough people to elect an imaginary person? That is what is happening. The real Kamala Harris is fading into the background, while a new, virtual Kamala Harris fills every nook and cranny of the information space. Can this virtual candidate jump from cyberspace into reality? Alternatively, is this the bridge too far and what triggers a change in how people view the media?<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Gaslighting<br/><br/>* Menticide <br/><br/>* Max Boot <br/><br/>* Desperate Times<br/><br/>* A Crazy Person <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="There is some merit in the claim that we are living out a cheaply done remake of the period after the cultural revolution of the 1960’s and 1970’s. One piece of evidence in favor of that is the Kamala Harris plan to bring back wage and price controls. This was a policy created by Ricard Nixon to fight inflation, which was about the same as we are experiencing today. The official statistics are different, but that is the beauty of a remake. It updates the original.The doomers are sure this will win the election for Harris, on the grounds that the public is so dumb they will fall for this stunt. That is why I need a break from following this stuff. My patience for the doomers has reached a new low. Yeah, the copers are a bore, but at least they refuse to give into despair, which is the worse reaction to present trouble. It is not that there is always hope, but that there is always something you can do, even it is to die a valiant death.<br/><br/>I do not think I can read another Greg Hood tweet about how we are all doomed because the media controls our minds and there is no solution to it. I like Greg and I get what he is saying, but, my goodness, if you really feel that way then kill yourself. I do not think he really feels this way, but that is the effect when all you do is post about how we are doomed. I think I might take a couple weeks away from Twitter just to cleanse the mind of these guys.<br/><br/>That aside, the weird parallels to the 1970’s are interesting. The Harris plan comes from Elizabeth Warren who was not young in the 1970’s, so she surely recalls the epic disaster that was the Nixon inflation policy at the time. It is good proof that we are living through a bizarre nostalgia trip of a generation that is about to shuffle off the stage. It is just once last bit of good vibes for them before the icy hand of death touches their heart.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Peak Lunacy <br/><br/>* Crazy People <br/><br/>* Ick Meister <br/><br/>* More Crazy People <br/><br/>* Police State <br/><br/>* Stupid Police <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="When I recorded the show, I had not dug into the official bullshit about the arrest of Pavel Durov, the Russian guy who founded Telegram. I still lean toward this being connected to the Ukraine war, but maybe the free speech people are right, and it is about censorship. Politically, it is better if people see it as an attack on liberal values, like free speech. That is an easy issue to rally around, and it appeals to a much larger segment of the populace.<br/><br/>In politics, there are three questions that must be asked about something like this. The first is whether the facts are true. In this age, jumping on a false story can be bad for business. The next question is whether the thing is useful. That leads to the question of who it benefits. That is what must shape the response to everything. As the most cunning political animal in human history once said, “the question is always who shall overcome whom.”<br/><br/>With that in mind, here is a what Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former president had to say. He is also one of the savvier as far as using social media to transmit information to the West. As a result, he is someone who young people in Russia tend to look to for understanding what is happening in the Kremlin. Medvedev has proven to be one of the craftier politicians within the Putin inner circle.<br/><br/>\"Once, quite a long time ago, I asked Durov why he did not want to cooperate with law enforcement agencies on serious crimes. “This is my principled position,” he said. “Then there will be serious problems in any country,” I told him.<br/><br/>He decided that his biggest problems were in Russia, and he left, and then also received citizenship/residence permits in other countries. He wanted to be a brilliant \"man of the world\" who lives well without a homeland. Ubi bene ibi patria!<br/><br/>He miscalculated. For all our common enemies now, he is Russian – and therefore unpredictable and dangerous. Of a different blood. Definitely not Musk or Zuckerberg (who, by the way, actively cooperates with the FBI). Durov needs to finally understand that one does not choose one’s Fatherland, just like one does not choose one’s times…\"<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>Me Rambling Like An Idiot<br/><br/>More Bullshit   <br/><br/>RFK FR.   <br/><br/>Pavel Durov <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Autumn is upon us which means the campaign will move to the center of our thoughts. The first debate is this week, and it should be amusing if the CNN interview of Harris is an indication of what we can expect from her in a live setting. It is clear that her handlers are very worried about this, which is why they tried every trick in the book to rig the thing in her favor. Most likely, they have a secret deal regarding the questions and some moderator tricks on Trump.<br/><br/>To their credit, the Trump people held the line. Over the years, it has been standard operating procedure for the Republicans to help the Democrats rig these things in their favor. They would concede to the format, the moderators, the location, and the composition of the audience. Their principles demanded they roll over and play dead for the other side. The Trump people, most likely Trump himself, have held the line on most of it, which is another reason why conservatives hate him.<br/><br/>My hope is that Harris shows up half in the bag, slurring her words and cackling like a lunatic. That would be spectacular entertainment. You would get the event itself and then a week of the toadies trying to explain it away. People forget that the week following Fetterman’s hilarious debate was filled with absurd explanations for why this brain damaged hobo was shouting random words and phrases in response to questions.<br/><br/>Sadly, Trump will probably be on his best behavior. A little bird tells me that their internal polling is good in every key state right now. Harris is not doing events in New Hampshire because the public polling is correct, and she has a solid lead. As we saw with Biden, the plan for Trump will most likely be to keep the focus on Harris, especially when she is fumbling, and not come off as cruel or aggressive. That is probably the right call, but the not most entertaining result.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* The Folkmoot<br/><br/>* Trump Trial Delayed<br/><br/>* Debate Prep <br/><br/>* Virtual Campaign <br/><br/>* The Worst People <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="It has been fascinating to watch the Haitian cat devouring meme go viral as it was both hilarious and illustrative of the problem facing the managerial regime. Largely due to Musk owning Twitter, now stupidly called X, there was little the regime could do to stop the spread of AI generated images of Trump defending house pets from Kamala and her animalistic Haitians. Regime toadies online were left to snootily do the “but actually” meme in response to it.<br/><br/>It reminded people of 2016 when clever people created MAGA art as well as anti-Clinton meme campaigns that were often far cleverer than what came from Trump. This is why they moved heaven and earth to shut this stuff down for the 2020 election. There is no way we get the Haitian cat devouring story if the cranks were still running Twitter. Of course, this assumes that workarounds had not been found to get around the censorship.<br/><br/>That last bit is the real problem with the managerial system. Over time it becomes inward looking and insular, so it is unable to lead the conversion among those over whom it rules, which means it cannot adequately respond to criticism. Its attempts to control what is being said become increasingly heavy handed, while the efforts to circumvent the new controls get increasingly sophisticated. You see this play out in companies with weak management.<br/><br/>It is a universal truth of human existence that strong, confident leadership responds to criticism either by taking the criticism to heart and responding accordingly or by pretending to take the criticism to heart while quietly ignoring it. The strong leader knows that some criticism is good, so he strikes a balance between discouraging insubordination and encouraging supportive criticism. The weak leader treats all critics as threats to his power.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Cats & Dogs <br/><br/>* The Debate Conspiracy <br/><br/>* The Race<br/><br/>* Laura Loomer <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The show is late today because I had a social engagement over the weekend. Often, I will record the show Saturday night and then edit it up Sunday Morning. If not then I record early Sunday, but I did not get back until late last night, so it was a bit of a late start today. It is funny how talking with people in a social environment about current events changes how you look at the news. Normally, I avoid speaking about politics in the meat space, so the news lacks that context.<br/><br/>One of the things I bumped into was a few people using the word “weird” to describe J.D. Vance, which they obviously picked up from television. They are Trump people, but they are not enthusiastic about Vance and the main reason is the media gaslighting. That and Vance is pretty much Ned Flanders and in the political space this is quite odd. We have been conditioned to expect our politicians to have the profile of a carny, because most of them are carnies.<br/><br/>There were other things like this which was a good reminder that most people get their opinions from the media, in the sense that they look to media sources for their opinions. The people consuming Candace Owens content tend to accept the framing and conclusions. They sought her out, however, because people they know online or in the meat space followed her. People migrate into their preferred silos, but there is interaction between the silos.<br/><br/>This is why the regime is ruthless regarding dissent. It is not that they fear an honest debate as conventional conservatives have always claimed. It is that they worry about the stuff that could leak over from dissident silos. The relative weirdness of Vance is meaningless in the Trump silo or even the dissident silo, but the relative normality of Vance leaking into the regime silo presents problems they fear because they have no way to police such bad thoughts inside their own silo.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Based Black Guy <br/><br/>* No Debating It <br/><br/>* The Bullshit Stream <br/><br/>* Crazy People <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One of the things the robot historians will puzzle over is the paradox of race. On the one hand, upper-class whites, fellow whites, and nonwhites pound their fist at the alleged racism of the white majority and the society that makes these groups possible. On the other hand, the people getting pilloried for their alleged sins regarding race go out of their way to worship nonwhites. It is a condition that should not have persisted this long, but here we are anyway.<br/><br/>Yesterday I popped on the television to watch a college football game. I wanted a lazy day to just do nothing and watching a sportsball match from the couch qualifies. The first thing I see is a studio show with a girl and some blacks. I have no tolerance for people talking about sports for a living, so I went scanning around for the games that were scheduled. I landed on one and the color guy is a black guy who clearly has a two-digit IQ and struggles to make sentences.<br/><br/>Now, the color guy is always a former player, and they tend be a bit thick, but they have always been able to form sentences and at least tell a few colorful anecdotes. This guy was struggling to spit out a basic observation, despite help from the play-by-play guy. Scanning around, I see that the trend now is to make sure the booth is vibrant and diverse. The easiest way to make the call of the game as vibrant as possible is to make the color guy into a colored guy!<br/><br/>One reason for it is the normal leukophobia, but another reason is Afrophilia. A sizable chunk of the audience is assumed to worship black people. That white remnant that is so vilified by the beautiful people for their antipathy towards blacks actually worships black people. They want nothing more than to be confirmed by a black. They are justified in organizing their life around watching sportsball because the magical black guy on television loves sportsball too!<br/><br/>It is not just that sports are loaded with magical black people in the presentation. The games also come with the lectures from the beautiful people on race. One team gives out a special number because it was worn by their first black player. The guy was not particularly good as a player, but he allowed the white fans to touch his robes and wash his feet. It is an insane paradox that the robot histories will never be able to unriddle, no matter how good their artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* ·         Afrophilia <br/><br/>* ·         Israel Fatigue<br/><br/>* ·         The Looming Debate<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The natural disaster in Appalachia is a foreshadowing of what lies ahead. No doubt the Biden admin is cheering the suffering. They hate white people. That is a big reason why so little federal relief has come to the area. General hatred of the people also hampers what efforts have been made so far. Another big piece of the puzzle is incompetence. The government is no longer able to do many of the things is tasked with doing, like organizing disaster relief.<br/><br/>What you see going on in the disaster area is that white people are figuring out how to both address the immediate problems caused by the storm and work around the government. This will be something we start seeing more often as rural communities figure out that they can no longer expect the system to work for them, so they must fend for themselves. This attitude will inevitably spread inward to the white exurbs and then the suburbs.<br/><br/>This is not without precedent. Throughout history, this is the fate of empires. On the fringes the empire is no longer to provide protection, so the fringes evolve their own protections. Over time the fringe grows until all of a sudden, it is an autonomous zone and then it breaks free entirely. This process repeats and accelerates as the empire declines.

    desc="We are officially in the home stretch of the campaign. I think if you are on Team Harris, you are very concerned with how things have changed over the last month. The way this was supposed to go was after the great gaslighting of August, what would follow would be events that the media would use to keep the air in the Harris balloon. First would be the introduction of Walz, then the first debate, then the VP debate and then the final debate in the closing weeks of the campaign<br/><br/>Instead, the Waltz act turned into comedy and the presidential debate was a clunker. In the fullness of time, the VP debate will be seen as a turning point. If Walz had shown up dressed as a gym coach with a whistle around his neck he would have been less ridiculous. There is a general lack of seriousness with the Harris campaign and it was made clear in the debate. Harris fumbling scripted media events has added to the sense she is not a serious candidate.<br/><br/>As for Trump, he is doing what he always does, but clearly with fewer zingers to bait the usual suspects into clutching their pearls. People literally taking shots at him as helped. The result is he is viewed as the safe and serious alterative to girl boss and bugman. It also reflects the normalization of his key issues like immigration and the racial subtext to it. Elon Musk publicly backing him has also gone a long way to blunting the anti-Trump madness this time.<br/><br/>There is a long way to go, but there is a sense that Trump is on his way to victory. The tone of the media has changed, even the international media. We are seeing Ukraine stories along the lines of, “If Trump wins this is what will happen with Ukraine.” The media is conditioning themselves and their fellow hive mates for what they think is coming. We will get a better picture in the next two weeks when we see who is campaigning where and with whom they are campaigning.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* General Election<br/><br/>* State Of The Race<br/><br/>* What To Watch<br/><br/>* Howard Dean 2.0<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="We have just sixteen more days of the election then the 2028 election starts! I wish I were kidding about that. Things are looking surprisingly good for Trump, if their “get out the vote” machine is as advertised. Early voting numbers, assuming they are real or close to real, favor Republicans in general. The polls are all better for Trump this time in the key states than they were in 2020. The riggers are less enthusiastic this time, but it is hard to tell with riggers. <br/><br/>The interesting thing about the Harris campaign over the last week is they decided to go all negative in their presentation and advertising. Usually, you go negative early, using proxies to dirty the opponent up, maybe baiting him into doing the same. Then the candidate shifts gears, appearing to take the high road hoping to be the cleanest dirty shirt. “My opponent has no plans, just more of the divisive politics that have ruined everything.” <br/><br/>Team Harris has flipped this on its head. That interview with Fox was hilarious, as it felt like the only thing Harris could remember about her prep was to say Trump’s name. What they wanted her to do was present a narrative that says the last ten years have sucked because mean orange man has made politics mean and orange. Instead, it came out as that weird exchange where she says “and Trump has been running for ten years” in response to a question about the polls.<br/><br/>The ads during the football games are just as weird. There is one with an old white guy who does the “I am a lifelong conservative but...” act, which never works. It is so hackneyed and stupid it suggests they have not hired good ad people. Then you have an old white woman who claims to be pro-life but voting for Harris because of Project 2025. No one knows or cares about Project 2025. This is an example of how the Harris people live inside their internet bubble, rather than in the meat space.<br/><br/>In total, however, it looks like the plan is to blast away at the idea that a vote for Harris is a vote against Trump to recapture the anti-Trump hysteria of 2020. This is what should have happened last month so that October could be the closing argument about all the free stuff you get if you vote the Harris. You get people wound up about Trump and then offer them the solution, so they are motivated to go out and stuff ballot boxes, rig voting machines and the rest of the ways they fortify our democracy.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="It is around this time that in the old days you could get a sense of the campaign by the demeanor and activity of the respective candidates. The guy dashing about from place to place, waving his arms around in an excited fashion, was probably losing. The guy who seemed like he was riding a great wave off the coast of Hawaii was probably winning. One of the many consequences of 2020 is you can no longer trust these sorts of judgements in assessing the race.<br/><br/>Even so, it is hard not to notice the very bad week for Harris. It has been a few bad weeks, in fact. Her campaign appears disorganized and chaotic. The Houston stunt is the sort of thing ham and eggers do because they think it is clever. Getting a big crowd to see a butt-waver then swapping the butt-waver for the candidate at the last-minute sounds clever to blinkered people who cannot contextualize how it will look once the fraud is revealed.<br/><br/>On the same day Trump does the Rogan show and it breaks the internet. Rogan does the weed head act to lure people into his show. He seems harmless, but popular, so people want to do his show as it is a cost-free way to get attention. He is not a simpleton, and he does often make guests look stupid because they think he is a dope. Bari Weis is the best example. Rogan quickly saw he was out of his league with Trump and turned into a smitten kitten.<br/><br/>All that said, the margin of fraud is the great unknown. The busting of the ballot stuffing caper in Lancaster County Pennsylvania is an ominous sign. It means the riggers are hard at work generating fake ballots to drop on us at the last minute. On the other hand, the busting of this operation is possibly an ominous sign for Harris. Maybe the local party is preparing to sit this one out. After all, the governor has his eyes on running in 2028.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Weird Week<br/><br/>* Media Meltdown  <br/><br/>* The Oligarchs<br/><br/>* Echoes Of Howard Dean<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Thomas Aquinas wrote that there are two causes of despair. One is the lack of striving for heaven, and the other is an attachment to worldly pleasures. On the one hand, a lack of faith can lead to a lust for material pleasure and on the other hand a lust for earthly pleasure can result in a turning away from God, which leads to despair. A lot of time was spent by Christian theologians on the question of despair, which is a curious thing from the perspective of this age.<br/><br/>It is not that most people have abandoned Christianity, but that it is so rare for someone to give up hope, no matter their conditions. Even the lowest bum thinks better days lie ahead. Much of what keeps people on drugs is the belief that they will one day rise from their condition. In fact, it is only when they begin to despair will they start to turn around their lives. That is not to say there are no people who have succumbed to despair, but that it is a rare thing.<br/><br/>Watching the jubilation from the Trump fans online, I am amazed how they seem to have forgotten what happened in his first term. His party, the other party, permanent Washington, the judiciary and the intelligence community worked to thwart him. It is only reasonable to assume they will do the same this time, maybe without the theatrics. Trump is wiser now and he has some support from the economic elites, but he still faces the orc army of managerialism.<br/><br/>That does not mean it is hopeless. It just means expectations need to be tempered. The most we can expect from Trump is for him to move the ball down the field, so that Vance can start from better field position if he wins in 2028. In fact, one of the top priorities of this term should be to set up Vance to take the baton from Trump and continue the fight. Every mortgage payment in Washington depends on Trump failing, so no one should expect a glorious revolution.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Optimism<br/><br/>* The Reagan Revolution<br/><br/>* The Crash<br/><br/>* The Resistance<br/><br/>* The Long Fight<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I got a complaint (I get many of them) about the volume of the show. Allegedly, the volume is inconsistent and generally not high enough. I edit using headphones, so maybe it sounds right that way, but not through regular speakers. I tested on regular speakers this morning and it is lower, for sure, but also sounds quite different in general. One project next week while it is slow is to tinker with my audio setup to solve various issues. Let me know on the sound quality issue in the comments.<br/><br/>The show itself is about the Trump cabinet. It is an odd bunch, but it reflects the changing nature of the party and the base of the party. You really see it with economics. The days of “free market” corporatism are in the past now. The people Trump will nominate to key posts are not dogmatically committed to open borders, open trade and open season on the working-class. It is going to be quite an adjustment for some to make, even those on this side of the great divide.<br/><br/>Foreign policy will be Israel first. I have come to terms with this reality. If the choice is the neocons or the Israel lobby, I will take the Israel lobby. The former camp is far more dangerous than the latter camp, at least as things stand. Exterminating that pestilence will take time, but Trump putting up the not welcome sign to the neocons is a start. We must hope that the other side remembers that they hate the neocons too and then maybe this menace can be eradicated.<br/><br/>In general, it is a cabinet that reflects some learning from the first term. The primary qualification is loyalty to Trump. In the first term, Trump followed the civic nationalist approach and selected people he thought were loyal to the country. Only stupid people are loyal to abstractions. In politics, it is always about being loyal to you. For good or ill, Trump will have a cabinet full of people whose future depends on making the boss look good.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Holiday Schedule<br/><br/>* The Foreign Policy Shop<br/><br/>* The Economic Shop<br/><br/>* Trump The Gun Grabber<br/><br/>* Mokita<br/><br/>* The Realignment<br/><br/>* Nuclear War<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Before recording I scanned regime media for what is happening in Syria. It appears the government has not given them the narrative yet, so not much to go on. It does appear that the government has collapsed and now there is chaos in the country. This is a shocking development as no one seems to have prepared for the collapse of Assad government. That means what follows next is probably a bloody chaos, then a civil war and then a regional proxy war that could become a global war.<br/><br/>In the short term, expect to see millions of migrants flow out of Syria. Most will first try to make their way to Europe, but that is now more difficult due to the Ukraine war. Merkel’s millions went from Syria through Turkey into the caucuses and then through Ukraine. Of course, the Turks are happy to help them make their way into the Balkans. Then you have the American NGO’s who are busy working on their grant applications to fly Syrians to your neighborhood.<br/><br/>The bigger issue is having another Libya in the heart of the Middle East. When the usual suspects overthrew Gaddafi, the result was over a decade of war and chaos. That is most likely what we see in Syria, but this time with Iran, Russia, Israel, Turks and the Saudis directly involved. One must wonder if the whole point of this was to make it so the Trump administration is immediately trapped in the tar pit of Levantine politics.<br/><br/>The puzzle is why Erdogan went along with it. He is the biggest loser in this. He will now have to deal with a million more Syrian refugees, many of whom would like to kill him. In addition to Kurds, he will now have a hodgepodge of Islamist operating inside his borders, maybe thinking that he should follow Assad into exile. He is a snake, so he certainly has an angle, but even the cleverest snakes misjudge things and get their head chopped off.<br/><br/>The second biggest loser are the Iranians, for now at least, as they lose their transport corridor to Lebanon, which they used to supply Hezbollah. That could change as they figure out how to deal with the chaos in Syria. The biggest winner is Israel. Surprise! They will now steal more Syrian land, and the Iranians will not be able to restock Hezbollah. Of course, they could easily end up with an ISIS controlled state willing to wage unlimited war against the enemies of Mohamed.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Syria<br/><br/>* Ukraine<br/><br/>* South Korea<br/><br/>* France<br/><br/>* Romania<br/><br/>* Killer Healthcare<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="We are roughly five weeks from Trump be installed as the next ruler and there already is the sense that things are changing. This week Trump and his crew were invited to the New York Stock Exchange to ring the bell, which was treated as a perfectly normal thing to do. A year ago, he would not have been permitted in the building and the New York Times would have called it a scandal if he was allowed on the property, much less rang the opening bell.<br/><br/>All over we see these signs that something in the places we never see, has changed. The priss who runs Apple was down at Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring. Like the rest of the Silicon Valley oligarchs, he was there to bend the knee to the new boss. This never happened after 2016. It is fair to say that if Trump had won in 2020, it would not have happened at all. Too many oligarchs are swinging to the side of Trump for there not to have been some change of heart in the clouds.<br/><br/>They will never share with us why they are suddenly okay with the guy they said was a threat to democracy and possibly Hitler reincarnated. One guess is they have grown very worried about what is happening in the world. The new cold war with China and Russia is bad for business. Then you have the fact that the American economic model is under threat, due in large part to the gross mismanagement of foreign policy over the last four years.<br/><br/>This may be the final phase of Brazilification. In Latin American, the economic and political elites are all European ancestry. The occasional brown guy turns up, but the people running these countries are exclusive and they keep it that way. The struggle is to keep the disruptive white fraction from enlisting the non-white masses to challenge the all-white ruling elite. This is the political dynamic in every Latin America country. It is one of those things that everyone knows, but never admits.<br/><br/>This may be what is happening now. Note that they have even toned down the “legal immigration” talk and are fine with surrogates talking about ending all immigration. Trump says he will sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship. This is a huge swing from his rhetoric eight years ago. It is a huge swing from his rhetoric a year ago. Maybe the crazies were right, and Trump is ushering in white nationalism, just the Latic American variety.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Another Trump Win<br/><br/>* The Post Office<br/><br/>* Senator Trump<br/><br/>* Winds Of Change<br/><br/>* Throw Pelosi Down The Well<br/><br/>* Fizzling Boycott<br/><br/>* Droning On<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I ran out of time in the show to do this one, so I will do it here. If you want a white pill to end the year the collapse of the point-and-shriek subculture is a good one. Five years ago, a post like this would have been a huge deal, requiring Yarvin to issue a statement. He would not have been cancelled because he has the force field, but it would have required some groveling. Various Claremont figures would have come out to defend him to keep it from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Today it is largely ignored. The only reason I knew about it was the www.memeorandum.com had it down near the bottom of the list. This is the slowest of slow times for the news, so that site is scaping the bottom of the barrel for content. There was nothing in Twitter. A few days ago, that disgusting slob Heidi Beirich posted a smear against Michael Anton and that went nowhere. It barely rated much attention at all. This stuff is just not working anymore<br/><br/>One reason for this is a major link in the chain of custody has been removed from the way these stories moved from the fever swamps to regime media. The way this worked was the fever swamp would get one of these moving on social media and then it would be picked up by the minor league media types and then recycled by the regime media platforms. The artificial boost by Twitter has been removed simply by letting things trend organically.<br/><br/>Now if the New York Times wants to run a smear campaign against someone they must own it rather than pretend they are covering it. This was always part of the “invisible man” strategy. Progressive love creating an invisible man to do the dirty work so they can pretend to be observers, commenting upon the natural flow of history. “Some people say you are a polarizing figure” always turns up in whenever a normal person agrees to talk to a crazy from regime media.<br/><br/>Musk buying Twitter has had the unintended effect of buggering up the mechanism these people used to manufacture their invisible men. Not only can they no longer game the algo to artificially get their stuff trending, but many of the crazies also have either quit the game or shuffled off to Bluesky, which has become an isolate echo chamber. They have made themselves in a tree falling in a forest with no one around to heard it fall.

    desc="The first week of the year has been interesting. On the one hand we have the bizarre terrorist events that make no sense at all. On the other hand, we have the world’s richest man blowing a gasket over immigration and then taking on the British government regarding grooming gangs, which are the direct and predictable result of immigration. All the arguments in favor of infinity Indians were used by the British ruling class to justify infinity Pakistanis.<br/><br/>Just five days in and the simulation is veering out of control. The people running this thing must have overindulged during the holidays. Of course, tomorrow brings the anniversary of the peaceful protests in support of Trump in 2021. The weird silence around it could mean something big is coming. It is hard to accept that the people who obsessed over this for four years have suddenly decided that it is no longer important, considering the recent election.<br/><br/>Of course, if it is a quiet day, it proves that there was never any organic support for the pogroms against the protestors and Donald Trump. The whole thing was manufactured. The disappearance of Antifa and BLM is more support for the argument that these things were just tentacles of the regime. A good project for someone would be to track down some of the less famous characters in these things and see what they are doing with themselves now.<br/><br/>That aside, the way to bet is that the coming weeks will feature increasing levels of hysteria from the usual suspects. Maybe they have run out of steam. Maybe the economic elites have had enough and are now clamping down on this stuff. That would be good news, if true, but it would not mean we are out of the woods, as the economic elites still cling to the old madness.

    desc="Since I gave away a bit of green door content this week, I thought I would make up for it with some bonus green door content. I am probably going to put up a video once a week as I sort my way through this new medium. The videos will be short because that imposes some discipline on me and there is an upload limit on SubscribeStar. There is no limit on Substack, as far as I can tell, but I like to remain consistent. The plan for now is to do some five-minute videos to get the hang of it and figure out what I want to do with it. One of the things I learned with writing is that to get the best result you should write what you like to read. Once I figured that out, things came together, and I started to get an audience. I learned nothing from the experience, so when I started the podcast, I had to relearn that lesson. I now do what I like. The challenge with video is that I have not thought much about what I like, but at least I know what I do not like and that is long videos. You need to be spellbinding for me to watch a two-hour video. When I want to kill time, I watch short videos, maybe up to thirty minutes depending on the topic.

    desc="This coming week could be a lot of fun, as it is the runup to Trump being installed as the new ruler, so the crazies could be out in force. On the other hand, the crazies have been weirdly quiet since the elections, so maybe it is a peaceful week. It is the old line about the dog that did not bark. Everyone keeps waiting for the crazies to do their thing, but they remain quiet and no one in official media seems to be noticing the lack of noisy weirdos.<br/><br/>The sudden quiet tells us that much of the craziness of the last decade or so was nothing more than a fad that has now run its course. Instead of women suddenly wearing a particular type of clothing or getting their hair done a certain way, it was mostly women picking up deranged political causes. There were men involved in the madness, but it was clearly a female led thing. It was obvious if you looked carefully at the Antifa mob. The girls were in charge.<br/><br/>Of course, these things do not happen overnight. You could tell that the steam had run out of the various crazy causes, even though there were still plenty of crazies. This follows the pattern of women’s fashion, where a fad pops up overnight, peaks, begins to fade and then just like that, it is gone. Antifa has become the denim suit.

I was not going to post it because I did not like how I looked, but then I remembered that I do not care that much about how I look. That and it is a good motivation to stick to the diet and exercise regime.<br/><br/>I had to do some edits and splice in the Jared Taylor clip, so I learned a few things about video editing. The main thing I learned is that the things you are most likely to do are made more difficult by the software. If I wanted to add a fairy dust overlay to the video, that is just a click of a button. Clipping out the part where I sneezed took an hour to get right.<br/><br/>The main snag in this idea thus far is that it is cold right now. When I shot that video, it was about twenty degrees in the barn. Even with a bunch of shirts on I was feeling it, which had me thinking about going inside rather than recording. I also must do something about the lights. Not only it is terrible for recording video, but it is also terrible for working on stuff too.

    desc="The restoration is tomorrow, and the gods are sending unusually cold weather to the imperial capital, which should keep the lunacy to a minimum. There is always something happening in Washington, as the crazies never take a break. This has been true since forever. In the summer, there is a group protesting something just about every day. Bad weather and holidays are the exceptions. That means there will be some crazies out on Monday.<br/><br/>The thing to watch is the media attention. If the WaPo and NYTimes ignore these people, it confirms that there was a memo sent out to put the crazies on mute. The power of the media is the power to ignore, so if they are ignoring these people then that says something changed. The way things are shaping up, the coverage will be left to back page writers and the C and D list media. The crackpots of Bluesky will be where the action is tomorrow.<br/><br/>Not covered on the show, but the rumor is there will be one hundred executive orders signed by Trump on Monday. Most are probably rolling back things they had Biden sign. Many of Biden’s early orders were petty reversals of Trump polices, so there is executive order inception happening. It will be interesting to see the list, as it will give and preview of the coming battles. You can be sure that the lawyers are all set up to dash off their court challenges to all of them.<br/><br/>One good early sign is the Israel – Gaza ceasefire. Trump forcing this on Israel is the exact opposite of what most suspected. The antisemites are besides themselves over it. It looks like the Netanyahu government will collapse because the hard liners have left the government. It would be a good thing if Netanyahu left the scene and was replaced by a left-wing coalition.

Video is not for cheap Slavs.You will note that this video is not from the bed of my truck or even my barn. It is bitter cold here at the fortress of solitude. It dropped below zero last night and the high today was in the low teens. The wind only makes it more pleasant.

    desc="It has been a wild week. The blizzard of executive orders from Trump was quite a thing to behold, not only because of their content. The fact that he could go after birthright citizenship and affirmative action in government contracting speaks to the shift in attitudes. Five years ago, a public official could mention birthright citizenship but never proposed ending it. No one dared speak about affirmative action, unless they were headed to this side of the great divide.<br/><br/>Things will settle in a bit now that his initial shock and awe campaign has ended, but there are other big items on the agenda. Trump is supposed to begin his campaign to revise the tax code. He was in Vegas talking up his scheme to make tips tax free. Everyone making a living on YouTube is praying for this one, as it means a chunk of their income would be tax free. That is like getting a 40% raise. My guess is that more people get paid super chats than with physical tips.<br/><br/>Again, the stunning thing about what we are seeing is the lack of hysteria. It is as if the people running the simulation updated the system to remove Antifa and blue haired females. Those characters have been dropped from game play. The real reason is the money has dried up for these people, so they are going back to the fever swamps. The reason for that is the economic elite have decided that things must change, and they cannot change with the crazies in the way.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* The Blitz <br/><br/>* The Purge <br/><br/>* The Cucks <br/><br/>* Security Clearances <br/><br/>* Ukraine Money <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One of the things I am quickly learning with video is that it is an enormous time sink, especially when you are learning how to do it. This five-minute video took a little over an hour to produce, which included multiple takes and multiple drafts. By comparison, it takes about ninety minutes to record the Friday show most weeks. Maybe a half hour of prep and then editing it for weird noises. All together it is about four hours of work over a few days.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the biggest challenge thus far has been the audio. The mic on the camera is not great, so it means using some sort of remote mic. Where the mic is located on or near you makes a much bigger difference outside than inside an office or studio. That means editing the resulting audio takes way more work than with the podcast. It is easy to see why professional video makers have sound engineers to figure it out on the front end.<br/><br/>That said, not knowing what you are doing makes a big difference. When I started the podcast, I would take up to ten hours to get a one-hour show. It was not at one sitting, but a little each day until I finally had it to an acceptable level. Much of that time was spent figuring out how to remove a weird noise without removing the whole clip. Now it is second nature. Presumably, something similar will happen with my video editing learning curve.<br/><br/>The news says that Team Trump is firing dozens of FBI agents and DOJ lawyers. The number I heard was ninety FBI agents, most in senior management. The DOJ lawyers are all J6 people. My bet is some of those fired FBI guys know a thing or two about editing videos, given how much time they spend faking evidence for their frame-up jobs. Now that they are looking for work, maybe I can pick up a post-production staffer or two for this operation.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this is a stunning move. I did not think they would go through with it or if they did, it would be a few people who did egregious things. Instead, they have decapitated the FBI. Word is they plan to clean house in the DOJ. The civil rights division will either be closed or folded into some other areas of the agency. Apparently, the DOGE people just shut down an IT agency that enforced things like pronouns in e-mails and the inclusive use of language.<br/><br/>The counter revolution is upon us.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Week two of the counter revolution was less flashy than the first week, but probably more significant in terms of what it means going forward. The house cleaning of the FBI and DOJ that has started says Trump was serious about exacting some retribution. It also suggests it goes beyond retribution toward a wholesale reorganization of these agencies. Kash Patel made that a center piece of his testimony during his confirmation hearing. He got very little pushback on it.<br/><br/>The fact that Kennedy and Gabbard made it to and through their hearings is another omen. In 2016 neither would have made it to the hearing phase. It raises the question as to what they had on Gaetz to force him out before his hearing. Most likely, Trump sacrificed him in a deal with the Republicans, who hated Gaetz for personal reasons. Regardless, getting Kennedy and Gabbard to this point is another example of how wildly different things are now.<br/><br/>The thing I am watching is the Musk takeover of the IT systems. The crazies are freaking out over this and maybe with good reason. The amount of collusion between the government, social media employees and the domestic terrorist doxing and stalking people is something that has never got much attention, but that could change. At least that is something the crazies fear. Then you have the billions that flow into underwriting the crazies from the government.<br/><br/>We now live in interesting times.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Following The Money <br/><br/>* Oh Canada <br/><br/>* The FBI <br/><br/>* Media Panic <br/><br/>* Full Speed Ahead <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I started the day on the road at six in the morning for the normie breakfast, fairly sure I was going to get back and spend the day asleep on the couch. The Devil Cat got me up at three in the morning. He has developed an obsession with the laser printer that has me baffled. I close the door to the office, but it does not shut properly. He has figured out how to get the door open so he can obsess over the printer.<br/><br/>On the way home, instead of being tired, I was gripped with anxiety. I was not sure what was causing it, but after a while on the road it occurred to me that I had spent too much time following the USAID scandal. For people on this side of the great divide, this week has been confirmation of many things we have been saying for so long that we no longer recall when we started saying them.<br/><br/>Instead of crashing on the couch, I split wood for a couple of hours and then I pulled the battery on the truck and hooked it up to the charger. Those who recommended the NOCO Genius charger are now responsible for whatever happens. The battery is now sitting on the bench in the pole barn with the charger supposedly making sure it is safely topped off with the proper number of electrons.<br/><br/>Before I pulled the battery, I tried to start her using the buzz box but before I could turn the key all the way the radio came on and it was a country station. It was Emmylou Harris playing Red Dirt Girl. I sat there in the cab, looking out at the sun slowly moving behind the trees, listening to a sweet song that brought back memories of both good times and bad times.<br/><br/>When a man starts his life, there are a million ways it can go. Most of them are bad, so that is why most men take the safe course. John Updike called it hugging the shore, by which he meant never going so far out that you could not get back to safety. At an early age I paddled out from shore and never came back, but here I am sitting in my baby looking out at the sun setting on my destiny.<br/><br/>I brought a couple of carts of wood up to the house as it is supposed to be a snowy week starting tomorrow. It occurred to me, as I was stacking wood, that maybe the reason I was feeling anxious on the way home is the same reason that I have just started to not lock the doors when I leave the house or how I no longer make a threat assessment whenever I am out in public.<br/><br/>For a long time, we have been losers. The old timers will tell you that we are built to lose, which is why we have been on the losing side since forever. Suddenly, our side is not only winning but winning bigly. There is something unnatural about it. The DOGE kid getting brought back because the President and Vice President decided to ignore the kooks is new.

    desc="I mentioned to Derb on Friday the old line from Lenin, “There are decades in which nothing happens and then there are weeks in which decades happen.” I suspect this is a phrase that will gain greater circulation after someone on Twitter claims they coined it or says it was Mark Twain or Ben Franklin who first said it. Too many Americans have been conditioned to think Lenin was evil to give the man credit for anything, but we live in age of wonders, so who knows?<br/><br/>That is something to keep in mind. The first three weeks of Trump 2.0 makes clear that this version has bigger goals than the first version. The DOGE team is using “waste, fraud, and abuse” as cover for remaking the government, at least the executive branch. They are clearly looking to cut off the money from the Blob to return power to the elected branches. That means the big fights lie ahead, as the Blob rallies to defend itself from the assault.<br/><br/>One fight that lies ahead is with the courts. The wacko judge who just barred the Treasury Secretary from looking at who is getting paid by the government is a possible opening for Trump lawyers to expedite a case to the Supreme Court. The questions before the courts will be which branch overseas these agencies and what are the limits of that oversight? This is an issue that has been kicking around since the 1970’s and may finally be resolved.<br/><br/>If you think the abortion war was big, just wait for these cases. This gets to the heart of the managerial system, because it has to do with the structure of the state. If the courts rule that these agencies report to the executive, which is almost certain, then most of these challenges melt away. Further, if the court rules that the executive is free to run them within whatever limits Congress places on them at creation, then it is over for managerialism in the political realm.<br/><br/>The reason is Congress was extremely vague when creating agencies like the Department of Education or the Environmental Protection Agency. At the time, they did not want to be clear about what they were doing, so they could later lie about it to their voters. After Watergate, no President was willing to challenge the alleged “independence” of these entities. This is what gave managerialism its power, but Trump is now challenging this assertion, thus taking on managerialism.<br/><br/>It is an amazing thing to see.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* The Super Cup<br/><br/>* The Boohoo’s Have Started <br/><br/>* Unitary Executive <br/><br/>* Impoundment<br/><br/>* Spare Me The False Worry <br/><br/>* Internews Network <br/><br/>* Security Clearances <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="One of the many challenges with video is that you must think about how you look, which is not something that comes natural to many people. When we go out into the world we dress appropriately and look our best, but once we are out and about, we stop thinking about it. Around the house, none of that matters. You dress for whatever you are doing around the house.<br/><br/>This applies when writing or podcasting. Doing video, changes that. You must think about how you look and what is around you. Audio is a warm medium, while video is a cool medium. With Audio, you can raise your voice a bit and express emotions, without starting the listener. Start waving your arms around or talking loudly in a video and people think you have lost your mind.<br/><br/>Off and on this week I have been working on getting what will be my studio for the new show I will be doing with Paul Ramsey. As with all things, there is a learning curve, which means making mistakes. This is probably the tenth effort on getting this “in studio” setup looking half decent. It is now Devil Cat proof, at least I think I have addressed all the ways he can create trouble for me.<br/><br/>At some point I may put something on the wall behind my desk. I have nothing on any wall in the house at the moment, which is my preference. It looks a little bland behind me so maybe I should find something to hang there. The trouble is it will be a Devil cat magnet, which means he will find a way to rip it off the wall. Perhaps the penitentiary gray wall is the best choice.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="Something I forget to get to in the show is this post in the state-sponsored Politico about how the Democrats are sad about the state of their brand. The other day James Carville was moaning about how they are in such terrible shape and Trump is indestructible. He said something along the lines that what would have easily killed most political careers just bounces off Trump. Together they get to the heart of the crisis in the political class.<br/><br/>The use of the word “brand” is the place to start. For the regime, politics has been about tricking enough of the rubes to keep the racket going. Having control of the centers of cultural production convinced them they need only come up with a new way to display themselves to the people whenever the old way of selling their brand grew stale. Mark Warner is a perfect example. He was the first guy to do the Elmer Fudd act to trick the rubes into thinking he was normal.<br/><br/>Carville’s line about not being able to destroy Trump speaks to the other side of how the regime operated for decades. While one side of the regime tried to trick enough people to claim a majority, the other side sought to destroy anyone who challenged them. Carville’s lament is about how that tactic no longer works. In fact, it seems to have fueled Trump to regain the presidency and now set fire to the institutions controlled by the regime.<br/><br/>The regime is still not understanding what is happening. Yesterday I saw an ad on YouTube that had a collection of actors pretending to be locals here in West Virginia. They were mouthing all the progressive lines, but through actors pretending to be working class and rural. It is the same crap they have been doing for decades. Supposedly, these locals are angry at Trump for cutting Federal jobs and not addressing environmental justice in West Virginia.<br/><br/>That was the power of government money. Until a month ago, they could pull this stuff and get showered with praise from a government funded audience. Tens of billions, easily more than a hundred billion a year, buys a lot of applause. Never getting any push-back made them lazy and stupid. Now that the money is gone and there are only jeers, they have no idea how to respond. They are the guy in his driveway trying to start his car, even though the battery is dead.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Europe Big Mad  <br/><br/>* Anchor Babies  <br/><br/>* USAID <br/><br/>* Ukraine <br/><br/>* DOGE Wars <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I did not get to it in the show, but the Atlantic piece I mention at the end seems to be part of the plan to reboot the race war started under Obama. Scanning the fever swaps known as Bluesky, I see lots of posts claiming that the real point of the assault on the Blob is to “roll back the Obama legacy.” It is not about the mass of unelected and unaccountable people who have taken control of the state, but about the old bogeymen that haunt the dreams of the crazies.<br/><br/>It is another example of the problem facing the crazies. Their tactics worked when they were supported by the Blob with both money and legitimacy. Take away the megaphones and money and it is just crazy people mumbling to other crazy people on the fringes. There has never been an organic audience for the things we call the left. The audience had to be manufactured to look like a consensus and the way it was done was by the Blob controlling the means of cultural production.<br/><br/>It is why the left is struggling with a response to the Trump initiative. For a long time, they just had to point and hiss, and the problem went away. There was no need to come up with a convincing argument based on agreed upon facts and sound reasoning. They just needed to utter one of the many buzzwords and the Blob would activate the network like an immune system attacking a virus. As a result, the ability to engage in debate withered.<br/><br/>The same applies to conservative establishment. They are even more pathetic because their act assumed that their friends on the left would always be there for them. What you now see from them is a bizarre mix of 1985 posting (Muh principles!) and the old sneering at those to their right which became the default position over the last several decades. It should be impossible, but their content is even dumber and more pointless now.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Your Fired <br/><br/>* Ukraine Game <br/><br/>* The Great Panic<br/><br/>* Race <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="History is full of weird characters who rise from nowhere to become an important player in what is often a strange moment in history. Rasputin is the classic example. He was a drunken, vulgar peasant who found a way into the employment of the Czar. The Count of St. Germain is less well known, but a far more outlandish example of someone who found a way to enter elite society at a global level, despite having no reason to be invited into that world.<br/><br/>In time, Volodymyr Zelensky may be on that list of mercurial figures who somehow ended up on the world stage, only to come to a bad end. The former actor and comedian, who was never all that good at either role, has become both the indispensable man and the clog in the drain of history that must be removed for things to take their proper course. The great struggle now is between those two opposing realities, which helps explain last week.<br/><br/>The neocons turned Zelensky into a folk hero so he could be the point around which Western politicians would rally. Then he became the clearing house for cash that flowed into Ukraine, some of which flowed back out into the pockets of European and American politicians. This only worked if there was a war with Russia, so they worked with Zelensky to make negotiations with Russia impossible, short of the unconditional surrender of the Russians.<br/><br/>For Project Ukraine, Zelensky became the indispensable man. Trump comes to power, and he wants to wrap up Ukraine and move onto other things, but to do that he has to broker a deal between Ukraine and Russia. Of course, Zelensky cannot do this as his very existence rests on this war with Russia being a permanent feature of life. It is why his peace plans always revolve around the West joining the Ukrainians in the fight on the ground.<br/><br/>The blowup on Friday now creates a serious problem for the Europeans. Despite the tough talk from the soy boys and girl bosses, they cannot risk a genuine split with Washington. They think Trump is bluffing about cutting off Ukraine, but once they realize that he is not bluffing, they will confront the same issue Trump has observed. The thing clogging the pipes, preventing things from flowing in the proper direction is Zelensky, which means he will have to go.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Ukraine Events<br/><br/>* The Headlines<br/><br/>* The Analysis<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I hate daylight savings time. The main reason is every year it means a week where it feels like I am late for everything, like I overslept by an hour. As a person who likes to get an early start, this is the worst feeling in the world. Sure, I get that wonderful vibe in the autumn where it feels like I gained an hour, but it is not a trade-off I favor. The spring forward misery far outweighs the fallback benefit that is long forgotten by the time spring arrives.<br/><br/>Daylight savings time is an artifact of the late industrial era boom where all the best people were sure they could solve all the world’s problems. The concept was literally dreamed up by a bug man. New Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed the idea of moving the clocks forward because be worked odd hours at a factory and wanted more daylight to collect bugs. Eventually the busy bodies latched onto it, and we got this stupid concept.<br/><br/>Daylight savings time is a lot like tax time. The people who like daylight savings time are the same sorts who like getting a tax refund every year. They do not grasp how the government was borrowing their labor for the prior year, only to return a bit without interests. They look at it as a gift from the government, the wonderful and benevolent government. The same applies here. People think they are getting a free hour of daylight from their rulers.<br/><br/>The closest thing to immortality is a government program and you see it here. Trump mentioned getting rid of this and he was bombarded with messages from bugmen demanding their free hour. Even suggesting we just leave the clock alone starting now does not work. For some reason, a sizable portion of the public wants to feel like the government is giving them more sun each spring. Perhaps it is just a part of our primitive brain at work.

    desc="A pleasant surprise this week from the Trump administration is that they continue to plow ahead with eliminating government jobs and government programs. After the initial flurry of actions in the first month, they seemed to hit a wall for a few weeks, but this week we saw more action. The elimination of Voice of America is the big one. It is not so much for what it does but for what it presents, which is the policies and mindset of the last century.<br/><br/>They continue to deal with rogue district court judges, but that may be coming to a head. There was a case in Rhode Island where a judge demanded the administration not depart an Arab woman, but they went ahead and deported her anyway. This was most certainly done on purpose as a warning to the Supreme Court about what lies ahead. There is another case where a district judge ordered the admin to hire everyone back, which has been appealed to the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>They may have been handed a good opportunity to threaten the court yesterday. District Judge Boasberg preemptively forbid the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly deport Venezuelan drug gangs. Judge Boasberg colluded with the FBI to abuse the FISA warrant system in order to spy on Trump in the 2016 campaign. They should now open a criminal probe into him and his family as a warning to the court of what comes next if they persist.<br/><br/>It is far too soon to be celebrating anything, but at the two-month mark of Trump 2.0, we are in a place few imagined possible. Paul and I did a show on Reagan last week and way back then it was the dream of normal people to see things like the Department of Education eliminated. Forty years later, the Trump team just cut eighty percent of the jobs. Time will tell if they manage to get this project across the finish line, but we are nonetheless living in exciting times.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Still Cutting<br/><br/>* Alien Enemies Act <br/><br/>* Crooked Judge <br/><br/>* Thrown The Bums Out   <br/><br/>* Ukraine Machinations<br/><br/>* Salty Tears <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

If the weather is not terrible, it is a good place for it. The background is nice, and the table is plenty big to set the camera up. The only issue is the animal noise, but they were busy doing something else this evening, so there were no problems there.<br/><br/>The one flaw in this video scheme thus far is the five-minute limit on video. This is imposed by SubscribeStar, which has a small file size limit. I might abandon posting videos there and post only on Substack. That way I can make longer videos. It is very hard to say anything in a five-minute clip. Ten minutes is about the minimum. Even small topics can demand more than a five-minute rant.<br/><br/>There is a lot to learn with video. The limitations on editing require more planning than with audio, where you can easily stop, back up and start again. You can do that with video, but unless you are Hollywood, the edits are obvious. I have seen video where it looks like the people have something wrong with them as the edits make it seem like they are jerking around.<br/><br/>I am still not sure what I will do with this. Maybe nothing. It is a hobby at this point, so I am trying different things. Once I get the barn cleaned out, I will start on the truck project, so maybe that will be the format. Maybe the show will be Racism and the Art of Old Truck Maintenance.

    desc="“Reality is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing in it” is a useful way of thinking about much of what makes up our politics. The Democrats and the people we call the left are running into this exact same problem as they struggle to deal with Trump. They are desperately trying to organize a resistance, but they are finding few takers. The “leaders” are now people like Ocasio-Cortez.<br/><br/>It is one of the rare occasions where the people we call the right were ahead of the people we call the left. The collapse of conservatism started in 2015 when the fossils in charge of it were pushed aside by a new movement and a new leader. The people we call the left continued on with business as usual, assuming that their dancing partner would eventually return.<br/><br/>That is what Chuck Schumer told people last year. He just assumed everything would return to normal. The old arrangement had been in place for so long that party leadership came to think it was the natural order. The Democrats now face a future in which their remaining talent is too old to make it up the stairs and its young talent is too crazy and stupid to be allowed near the stairs.<br/><br/>There is also the fact that the left side no longer had a money source outside of government. The right side could still shake down private donors on the promise of low taxes and special deals for business, but the left side became a ward of the state over the last decades. Now that the Trump admin is attacking their money source, they cannot function.<br/><br/>That is why we see that fossil Bernie Sanders shuffling around the country with Sandy Cortez. There is some organic support for 19th century socialism. It is not a big audience, but enough to fill a high school gym to hear speeches from yesteryear. The irony, of course, is that they are now arguing against the policies that would help the people they claim to represent, the working class.<br/><br/>The Democrats are in the same spot they were after they evicted Nixon. They are a cause in search of a purpose, led by people with no vision of the future. The difference is that in the 1970’s the baby boomers were coming along, which meant a fresh infusion of smart white people. The next generation of the left is not white and implacably antiwhite.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Weather & Trash<br/><br/>* Legal Vengeance <br/><br/>* Tough Turkey <br/><br/>* The Corruption  <br/><br/>* Brown Socialist Hero <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Something I noticed after recording the show is that there was absolutely zero Ukraine news, not even at the bottom of Memeorandum, where you see old links. The talks with Russia halted last week with a general agreement on a Black Sea ceasefire, but that was rejected out of hand by Ukraine. They also rejected the idea of a minerals deal. By the end of the week, Zelensky was telling European media that he is done with the United States and is partnering with Europe.<br/><br/>None of this made it into America media, as best I can tell. Maybe in the deep dark recesses of government media there was mention of this. Reportedly the Trump administration remains committed to a peace deal, but maybe not willing to do much about it. The Europeans are opposed to any peace deal and Ukraine cannot make peace for internal political reasons. The Russians would prefer a deal over a military solution, but they know it is unrealistic.<br/><br/>That leaves the Trump admin alone in wanting peace. That may be why the media is suddenly uninterested in Ukraine. If Trump is the only peacemaker, then it makes all his opponents look terrible, so best not to mention it. Trump may be happy to see the Ukrainians side with the Europeans as that frees him of this tar baby. Let the girl bosses of the EU figure out how they can bring this war to an end without talking to the Russians.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe there are big things happening behind the scenes. One of the weird things about Trump 2.0 is he has been very good at not talking. In his first term he was an open book, largely controlled by the media. This time he is keeping his cards close to his vest. He is also ignoring media created controversies like the Signal leak story. The original Trump would still be talking about that, but this Trump blew it off with a few banal statements.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Weather, Cats & Baking<br/><br/>* Waltz Nuts <br/><br/>* Car Wars <br/><br/>* Please Self-Delete <br/><br/>* Peace Be With You <br/><br/>* Lying Liars <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="The great panic kicked off today as the Trump tariff schedule started for real. It was amusing to see the far-left kooks and crazies suddenly sound like libertarians at a Von Mises convention. They are nothing more than hate-sacks, so they will say anything if it lets them yell “Goldstein” at their favorite enemy. Watching self-described anarchist shriek about the stock market made for a good day.<br/><br/>The yesterday men were no better. The guys who love mentioning Reagan conveniently forget that Reagan was a big fan of tariffs. He was not a libertarian goofball, so he understood that economics was not all that mattered. The point of the economy is to serve the people not the economics department. The yesterday men, on the other hand, are just dimwitted libertarians.<br/><br/>That is not to say this will be easy. The transition back to a normal, nationalist economic model is going to come with pain. The stock market will have a bad time as the models adjust. Some industries will suffer, but others will flourish. Real people, our people, will lose jobs and have a tough time of it. We have to keep that in mind as the old normal becomes the new normal again.<br/><br/>A year from now, however, things will adjust and the economy will improve. It may not even take that long as the smart money has been planning for this. German carmakers, for example, already have plans to move production to America, so the transition could be faster than expected.

Suddenly people who often claim to be Marxists and anarchists were praising the glories of free markets. Some have enough self-awareness to see the problem, so they claim they oppose the tariffs because they are nationalist and you know who was a nationalist, so tariffs are fascism or something.<br/><br/>Most lack self-awareness, so they just screamed at the internet.

What they forget is Reagan used tariffs to protect American industry, despite opposing tariffs on theoretical grounds. In theory, a tariff free world might be the best, but we do not live in theory. We live in reality. The yesterday men always leave that part out when chanting about Reagan.<br/><br/>It all points to the fact that the old post-Cold War politics are spent. The people on the so-called left and right have nothing to offer. The kooks who used to distinguish themselves from the official left by championing populist items now oppose those items. They have no answer to Trump’s agenda because they have nothing to offer as an alternative. In the new politics, Trump is the radical overthrowing the old order and the self-styled radicals are the entrenched conservative interests.<br/><br/>None of this is to say the Trump agenda is flawless or that it will work. We are just getting started, so we shall have to wait and see how it unfolds. The basic scheme, however, is sound. American tariff policy will match the tariff schemes of other countries. If Canada wants to do business with us, they must negotiate a tariff schedule with Washington. It may be radically different from the one worked out with China, but Canada is not China.<br/><br/>The foundation of what Trump is doing is pragmatism. A good deal for Americans with regards to trading with Canada will always be different from what is good for Americans in a China deal. Rather than adhere to an ideological framework, economic policy will be situational. What is good now may not be good a year from now, so a year from now you will do something else. The radical idea at the heart of it all is realism. In an age drenched in ideology, reality is a radical idea.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Hillbilly Subbotnik<br/><br/>* Hands Up!<br/><br/>* Victor Davis Nonsense <br/><br/>* Tater Haters <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Cleaning The Pole Barn"
    desc="Finally got off my lazy bleep to clean out the pole barn. When I bought the place, it came with a big pile of debris in the pole barn and miscellaneous stuff in various places, which I added to the pile. I also contributed a lot of boxes and packing material, so the result was a huge pile of rubbish. Over the last couple of weeks, I broke down the boxes and what I could to the recycling center.<br/><br/>I just about have everything gone, so the next step is setting it up as a shop. I have been scanning around for an air compressor. The first owner of the house was a mechanic, so he built a space outside for an industrial air compressor and ran pipe from it into the show area. I figure I can find a used compressor from the sale of a repair shop or maybe an estate sale.<br/><br/>My plan is to fix up the shop as needed. I want to start on the truck project, so that will provide many reasons to buy tools and shop items. In this area, there are always estate sales where part of the estate is a garage full of tools. My new hobby will be cruising these places looking for deals. There is a country-style auction house not far from here, so I will be investigating that as well.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    title="Sunday Thoughts April 13, 2025"
    desc="One of the things I touched on in the show at the end is the question as to whether we have reached a critical mass of crazy people. For example, most Democrats in the House voted against the bill requiring an ID and proof of citizenship to vote. This bill is what should be the minimum requirement for a functioning society that permits voting. Why did they oppose it? They have no idea. They just voted against it because orange man make them sad.<br/><br/>It is one thing for the odd crazy on social media to talk like this, but we have these types littered throughout the political system. It appears that many of the district court judges in the federal system, for example, are insane. They just hate the majority white population, so anything the antiwhites conjure, they enthusiastically embrace. They have no regard for the law. One must wonder how many of them managed to pass the bar or even make it through law school.<br/><br/>Colorado passed a gun grabbing bill last week, even though bills just like it have been shot down by the courts and the Supreme Court has been clear about the issue. They think they are clever by changing up the language, but it will fool no one. At best they are wasting the court’s time and the taxpayer money for a publicity stunt. More likely, everyone involved is a crazy person who is not fit for a civilized society, at least not fit to move about freely.<br/><br/>It is entirely possible that we passed the point of no return and therefore no amount of reform, not even authoritarian reform, will save us. The population will need a great reset before civilized government can return to North America. Maybe it is the organized deportation of the crazies to someplace not here or maybe Mother Nature steps in with a real plague. Perhaps it will require organized violence in the context of societal collapse to fix the gene pool.<br/><br/>Maybe that is why the fertility rate is collapsing. The mutational load has reached the point in our species where nature looks at us as a genetic dead end. We are like panda bears. It has evolved down a dead end in terms of its habitat, so it is dying out. Similarly, humans have evolved to the point where we can no longer maintain cooperative societies, which is our natural habitat. The presence of so many crazies signals, at best, a great culling of the human herd.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Tariff Mania<br/><br/>* Fake New-Fake Influencers<br/><br/>* Deporting Citizens <br/><br/>* Penal Colonies<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="The Woke Chart"
    desc="I stumbled upon this chart made by James Lindsay that is supposed to prove you are just as bad as the lefties. The woke right has all the same ideas as the woke left, you see, just a slightly different set of enemies. James Lindsay, on the other hand, has all the same views as the Founding Fathers. That is because James Lindsay is a good person and you are a very bad person.<br/><br/>You can tell he put a lot of time into this. One the one hand, he has made a compelling strawman for himself. On the other hand, his description of that strawman is so vague that it could mean anything. His definition of woke right describes no one that exists in reality, but he can claim it describes anyone he wants to give the stink eye. If you offend James Lindsay, you are woke right.<br/><br/>The funny thing is he is combining the gatekeeping of conservatism with the weird emotivism of the people we call the left. The point of his woke right stuff is to set himself up as the gatekeeper of the new right. At the same time, he litters his language with words that just mean bad. Moral absolutism in his usage just means bad absolutism or bad moral badness. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    title="Narrative Journalism"
    desc="One of the things that no one seems to notice about our media is most of what they report is made up. Not made up in that they are lying about the facts, which happen more often than not, but about the stuff around the facts. Instead of stating the facts, the writer creates a drama around the details that he has no way of knowing, so he just makes it up to create a compelling story.<br/><br/>You see it in the post that is the topic of this video. The only way the writer could know the things he describes is if he was in the room when it happened, but he makes clear he was not in the room. That means his description of the people and the atmosphere is from his imagination. The story is supposed to be a news report, but instead it is a micro drama.<br/><br/>This sort of narrative journalism has become so common that people just accept it without thinking about it. Every report is repackaged as a dramatic retelling of events, rather than a recitation of facts. That makes for more compelling copy, but it also makes for fake news. Once you start making up stuff to make the facts more interesting, it is not long before you make up facts too.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="Trump is coming up on the hundredth day mark of his second time in the White House, so this week will feature a lot of that sort of analysis. The “first hundred days” business has been with us since FDR, owing to the centrality of FDR in the managerial narrative. He was the first fully managerial president, setting the bar for how to take over a broke organization and setting it right. Ever since the one-hundred-day window has been a stock part of the presidential narrative.<br/><br/>There is a parallel between Trump and Roosevelt. Roosevelt was met with resistance from the courts until he unleashed his court packing scheme. The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 would have granted Roosevelt the right to appoint an additional justice for every current member over the age of seventy, up to six new justices. His own party killed the effort, but it did loosen up the courts so that the important bits of the New Deal could become law.<br/><br/>Trump will not get favorable comparisons to Roosevelt if he finds a way to influence the courts, but he will have to find some way to intimidate the judicial branch. The Obama admin threatened the courts to get Obamacare approved by the Supreme Court. They most likely blackmailed Roberts. The Bush administration got Congress to pass the Military Tribunals Act to get around the courts. This was eventually struck down in the Obama years in Boumediene v. Bush.<br/><br/>There is a lesson for Trump in the Bush experience. After 9/11, the Bush admin was hyper aggressive and confidence in their response. As a result, the midterms were a rare success. The 2002 midterm was just one of six successful midterms for a sitting president. It turns out that Osama bin Laden was right when he said that when people see a strong horse and weak horse, they will always pick the strong horse. Trump needs to be the strong horse.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Trump In Rome<br/><br/>* Zelensky & Trump<br/><br/>* First 100 days <br/><br/>* Deportation Panic <br/><br/>* Misinformation Science <br/><br/>* Epstein <br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Times Are Changing"
    desc="I decided to try doing a video at dusk to see how it looked. I might start doing the Wednesday show from the porch just for variety. The funny thing is you can see the light dying out over the ten-minute video. There are no edits, so within ten minutes it goes from well-lit to somewhat creepy looking at the end. Maybe I should do the flashlight under the chin bit next time.<br/><br/>The topic of the video is the white women busting out the colorful euphemisms and getting rich as a result. Last I checked she was up to three quarters of a million and will probably break a million this weekend. Juxtaposed to the fundraiser for the black kid who stabbed the white kid to death, it says a lot about where race relations are heading right now. They are getting worse.<br/><br/>That said, this might be the thing to tone things down. Blacks are a bit shocked by what is happening, so they have not been doing their usual antics. The old saying, “at your feet or at your throat” applies here. If whites are no longer willing to tolerate the race stuff, then blacks will stop doing it. You can be sure that there are some frantic meetings going on where this stuff is plotted.<br/><br/>My guess is this will be the topic of the Tuesday X space that I am now doing with Paul Kersey, Jared Taylor, and Peter Brimelow. The first two shows were fun, mostly because they are totally unscripted and off the cuff. This story should make for some interesting back and forth.

    desc="The honeymoon is officially over. Every president gets a honeymoon period, except for Trump in his first term. No president gets a second honeymoon after winning reelection, except for Trump in his second try at running the White House, but the honeymoon is now over. The bad guys have regained their balance, and they are once again seeking to drag Trump into the tarpit of established narratives with various coordinated attacks.<br/><br/>The other sign that the honeymoon is over is the vinegar drinkers who reluctantly joined in on the celebration of the election are now back to Trump-bashing. Whether it is his foreign policy or his lack of success on domestic issues, they have something to criticize. There is always a faction that predicts failure, and then actively looks for evidence of it. This is true in everything. I have seen it many times in the business world. Only enthusiastic success silences them.<br/><br/>In politics there is little enthusiastic success, so this type always has a place. In fairness, they are not always wrong about these things. There is growing evidence that it is too late to fix the problems of America within the rules, or even by creative interpretation of the rules. For example, there may be no fixing the court problem. Unless Trump is willing to become the dictator his enemies have claimed, his reform efforts may die at the hands of district court judges.<br/><br/>That aside, politics is always a grind, and we have now officially entered the grind phase. This is where we see if the Trump team is as prepared as they seemed during the honeymoon period. The test will be the new budget that is working through both houses of congress. This is supposed to include the cuts made by executive order, as well as a basket of new cuts, including military cuts. This means we are entering a summer of practical politics where the winner is the one who grinds hardest.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Phony Trump Effect <br/><br/>* Managerial Art<br/><br/>* Mike Waltz Fired <br/><br/>* Outlaw Courts <br/><br/>* Post-Nationalism <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="Videodrome Vol 1 EP 7"
    desc="I decided to give Stream Yard a shot a recording software. This is the platform Paul and I use for the Wednesday show. It is primarily for livestreaming, but it has a recording feature for what the word is for not livestreaming. It works well for the show, so maybe it will work for these videos. It has some added feature that I like, which seem to not exist in other options.<br/><br/>I think the main trouble with this platform is the audio. I could not get the echo out of it at all and I got tired of fiddling with it. There is no echo in the live show, so I am unclear as to why this happened. That and there is a slight lag in the audio and the video, which you can see on the livestream sometimes. It comes and goes, but if you look for it you can see it straight away.<br/><br/>As is true with everything, the more time you invest in something, the more you get out of it and I have not invested a lot of time in this project. On the other hand, the roughness of the product adds authentic. These videos are like an old piece of furniture you find at an estate sale.

    desc="I must confess that the dark clouds of despair are starting gather in my mind regarding the direction of the Trump administration. They are losing momentum, and it feels like the bad guys have regained their footing and are now finding ways to throw sand in the gears. For example, the Trump people have not solved the lawfare stuff or done anything other than mew about it. Congress is sitting on its hands on the issue, when it could step in and stop much of it.<br/><br/>That last bit is a tell. Congress was enthusiastic for Trump initially but now they are strangely quiet as the bad guys try to regain the initiative. Given how cowardly and corrupt the GOP is, it suggests they are about to switch teams. Of course, they were never on the Trump team, so it is not really switching teams, but publicly announcing their perfidy. I could be reading too much into this, but it feels like the Trump admin is sinking back into the tar pit of Washington politics.<br/><br/>The Ukraine deal is a good example. For reasons that are not clear, Trump has done a one-eighty and is now backing the European ceasefire deal, which has no chance of success. This is just the Fleitz – Kellogg scheme that was cooked up by the neocons in 2024. The purpose is to create a set of choices. One is the Russians give NATO time to resupply Ukraine and the other is Washington cuts off all talks with Russia and continues the Biden war.<br/><br/>In the show, I talk about one possible reason for Trump going along with this. Since it is doomed to failure, he can use it for domestic reasons. Lindsay Graham has a bill ready to go with the full support of the Senate that would impose tariffs on every country doing business with Russia, unless the Russians surrender immediately. Since every country in the world does business with Russia, even the EU countries, this is Trump’s tariffs with a different label.<br/><br/>Time will tell, but Trump’s passivity as the Europeans make a mess of what he has been trying to do to end the war feels like he has thrown in the towel. He is no spring chicken, and he has been through more in the last decade than most young men could handle. He could be running out of steam. The will to get up every day and fight the system is starting to wane. It is the thing to watch now that the honeymoon is over and the bad guys have reorganized.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Insurrection 2.0 <br/><br/>* Ukraine  <br/><br/>* Remigration <br/><br/>* Habeas Corpus  <br/><br/>* Port Narrative <br/><br/>* Black Nazis  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Since I will probably not be back in time to do a Sunday show, I thought I would do some news on the video this week. I have also honed my editing skills so that I could splice some footage from one place onto footage from another. Before long I will be making my own movies. This is probably how Stanley Kubrick would have started if he were born fifty years later.<br/><br/>You can tell when Trump has the wind at his back by the tone of the media. Looking at the news I see mostly nonsense drama that is either tiny things exaggerated to seem important or made up things that are made to sound important. That says Trump must be doing pretty good right now. The shrillness of the hysteria is also a good sign that Trump is on a bit of a roll.<br/><br/>The downside of this is the news is less interesting. The items in the show are the best bits I could find. The rest is only slightly better than the obituaries. Of course, the summer is upon us and Memorial Day is a week or so away.

I stopped at a local place for a chicken wrap, which was surprisingly good. Eight bucks for a wrap and fries. Everyone in the place was fat, and that is always a good sign for a restaurant.<br/><br/>I took care of a work item and then spent the rest of the afternoon cutting the field and the back area. I usually break it up, but I was feeling good. Working outside when it is in the low-50’s is much easier than when it is in the 80’s. Here it is Memorial Day weekend, and I need a sweatshirt to be outside. It is supposed to be down in the low 40’s tonight, so it feels like fall instead of late spring.<br/><br/>Since I did not post a video last week, I got out the camera and made a video that makes the podcast feel deep and absorbing. Now that I am getting comfortable with the editing of these things, I need to work on the pre-production. That might be a project for the weekend while I am doing the green thumb stuff. That is more of a thinking issue than a doing issue.<br/><br/>Now I am having a diet beer so I can watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have watched it a dozen times, but it has been a long time. It is the next movie on the top-100 list, so I need to watch again to make my way through the list. There is a good chance I fall asleep before the end, which has been my habit with this film.

    desc="I did not cover it in the show, as it gets no mention in the West, but it appears the Brits have another government crisis. So far, they have arrested three men for setting fires to the properties of the current Prime Minister. All three are what used to be called “rent boys” in the UK. All three are Ukrainian, which is a rather odd coincidence. Starmer has been obsessed with Ukraine since he was installed, to the neglect of the country he allegedly rules.<br/><br/>At the same time, the government has informally rolled back all of the changes made to comply with the Brexit votes a decade ago. The UK is now fully compliant with the billions of regulations imposed by the EU, but it does not have a say in how those regulations are made. Those regulations include how they deal with the millions of nonwhite invaders swarming the UK. It is as if there are people behind the scenes who are running things despite the voters.<br/><br/>It also feels like those people behind the scenes are trying to turn the island into a garbage heap. If you were trying to destroy the UK from within, it is hard to imagine a scenario much different from the one that has been playing out there for the last decade. It is as if the place has been conquered by an alien race that remains filled with resentment, despite their victory.

I am not starting from zero on the knowledge scale, but close enough to assume zero knowledge. I grew up in the country and I have spent a lot of time in the woods, so Mother Nature and I are on speaking terms with one another.<br/><br/>What I do not know is gardening, which involves plant selections, soil maintenance and water management. None of these things are terribly difficult in this age of YouTube videos and online resources. In the before times, people had to rely on ancient wisdom and trial and error. I recall an old guy when I was kid who was talked about as a wizard with rose bushes.<br/><br/>Oddly, I discovered his secret to growing roses. I was fishing with another kid, and we landed a big carp. The old guy gave us a dollar for it and said he would give us a dollar for anymore we caught that were that size. It turned out that he used carp for fertilizer, which was his secret trick to growing roses. That and he probably spent a lot of time tinkering with them.<br/><br/>I am not launching a gardening video, nor do I expect to be featured in one, so this is mostly a project to satisfy my own limited tastes.

    title="Sunday Thoughts June 01, 2025"
    desc="After recording the show and thinking about things while editing it, I think we might be about to see the end of the Trump presidency. I cannot get over the scene of Senator Poofberry and Senator Stolen Valor declaring that they are now running Ukraine policy – while in Kiev. So far, not a word from anyone in the Trump administration about it. That means they are either too stupid to see what is happening or they can do nothing about it.<br/><br/>The only positive spin is that they know Graham is lying and does not have the votes to get the bill through the Senate or they know the House will ignore it. That is not much of a positive. Foreign Policy is the domain of the executive and the only way a president can conduct foreign policy is if the rest of the world thinks he is in charge of foreign policy. Otherwise, he is nothing more than a grocery clerk running errands for whoever is calling the shots.<br/><br/>If Trump cannot get this under control in the next couple of weeks, his party will abandon him. It is not as if the Cuck Party was enthusiastic for him. They have fallen in line thus far mostly because he has had oligarch support for his domestic agenda. If Lindsey Graham is able to put a saddle on Trump and ride him around like a pony on foreign policy issues, then everyone is going to wonder if they are backing the right horse, to mix metaphors.<br/><br/>Of course, Trump’s foreign policy team is full of people who either lack experience or have a reputation for duplicity and perfidy. The fact that Mike Waltz was able to talk his way into Trump’s inner circle opens the possibility that the Blob sent these men in to destroy the Trump administration from the inside using foreign policy as the primary vector. That might explain why Rubio often looks like he is battling a monumental case of constipation.<br/><br/>Regardless of the causes, the next couple of weeks could be momentous. It appears that the Russians are running out of patience with Trump. The rumor is they will present harsh terms to the Ukrainians with a tight decision window. At the minimum, they will tell the West that the Istanbul deal now has a short expiry window. Once that window closes, the next offer will be much worse. That means Trump’s time to make a deal with the Russians is ending.<br/><br/>That means he will have lost control of his foreign policy. That alone could be enough to spook the oligarchs that have been backing him thus far. At the minimum it puts the administration on the backfoot and emboldens his enemies, especially on the Supreme Court, which is carefully monitoring which way the wind is blowing in Washington. This is the first crisis of Trump 2.0 and it could very well be what defines his second term.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Foreign Policy<br/><br/>* Ukraine<br/><br/>* Iran<br/><br/>* China<br/><br/>* The Curse Of Empire<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="I set to make a video that would be one part garden talk and two parts jibber-jabber about the Musk - Trump thing, but it is all garden talk. One reason is that I found I had more to say about gardening than I expected. I am just starting down the green thumb path, but I get why people get into it. It is not a hobby that taxes the mind, but it lends itself to contemplation.<br/><br/>The other reason is I do not care about the Musk - Trump spat. It is stupid and childish, a reminder that we are ruled by idiots. There is a lot to admire about Trump and Musk, but the truth is they are midgets hoping to stand on the shoulders of giants, so they can pretend to be giants. Men of higher purpose to do carry on like the two have done the last few days.<br/><br/>That is what I suspect is the appeal of gardening. It is a way to enjoy the future in the moment, but at the same time wade into the great timeline of existence. Digging up the work of people I never knew, but who made that little garden spot, while at the same time chipping away at a mountain that has been here since forever, provided a sense of time that I do not get from other tasks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

In case anyone is curious, I managed to get a window between periods of rain yesterday to get the flowers planted. If the claims about their growth are true, I am just a half dozen short of the goal. The nursery is open today, so I will be making another run and finishing off the task as soon as there is a break in the weather.<br/><br/>Something I did not cover in the show, but will probably be an issue this week, is the role of the usual suspects in the Los Angeles riots. Mike Benz has been posting about the fact that the National Endowment for Democracy has tentacles in these riots. Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, was a long-serving member of the board of directors at NED. When she was in Congress, she was on a committee that oversaw the organization<br/><br/>This is how the regime operates. It has access to hundreds of billions of dollars it uses to place its people in key posts inside the administrative state and get its friends elected. This is why it is impossible to cut a cent of spending from the budget. Instead of starting a race war, this time they are hoping to create a legume rebellion. This time, it seems that the Trump admin is prepared and maybe even let the Los Angeles thing play-out so they had a reason to go hard on it.<br/><br/>I made this point the other day, but there are trillions to be saved by merely deporting the people we call the neocons. They are responsible for at least ten trillion since 2000 just through their foreign policy schemes and that is surely a conservative number. Then you have the trillions they have spent hollowing out the country. We could probably close the budget deficit in a few years after rounding up and deporting this fifth column.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* Trump – Musk<br/><br/>* Kilmar Abrego Garcia <br/><br/>* LA Riots  <br/><br/>* Un-Woke <br/><br/>* Alien Nation <br/><br/>* Old Scratch Update <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    title="The Dissident Gardener #2"
    desc="It took more than a week, but I finally got enough breaks in the rain to finish digging out the bad soil and the rocky stuff to then put in new soil and the plants. Not knowing anything about gardening, I miscalculated the time involved in getting the area ready for putting in new plants. Frankly, I think the plan next year will be to rent a tiller and turn up the whole hill and make it a giant garden.<br/><br/>The results thus far are mixed. The Dusty Miller looks fine. I like the way it looks for some reason. The geraniums are not too bad either. I thought they were an advanced green thumb plant, but the lady at the nursery said they are a beginner plant, so I went with some of those. So far so good on those. The deer walked right past all of these and munched on the moss, so that is good.<br/><br/>The purple guys are not doing so good, but maybe they just needed some water. I am not sure how that is possible, given how much rain we had, but the soil looked a bit dry in spots, so after filming I soaked the area pretty good. I like the purple plants the best, so they will be the ones that die first. In the future, I will buy plants I do not like very much, so they will live forever.<br/><br/>For the first foray I am happy with the result thus far. I was going to put in shrubbery, but I am glad I went with the flowers. Not a ton of money involved and only a few hours’ work at this point. If they do what they are supposed to do, then I have something I can repeat every year. If not, then this fall I will cover the area with artificial turf and call it a career.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    title="Sunday Thoughts June 15, 2025"
    desc="This is one of those Sundays where the news cup runneth over. Midweek, I expected the weekend to be dominated by the No Kings event, but then the Jews launched their sneak attack on Iran, so I was thinking that would be the whole show. Then a Tim Walz protégé snapped and went around killing Democrats in Minnesota. Any one of these would have made for a good Sunday show, but three in one weekend was like Christmas in summer.<br/><br/>The No Kings organizers are probably happy that the Middle East went off, as it sucked all the oxygen out of the room as far as news coverage. A few events managed to attract a decent crowd, but even those were old white women waddling about pretending it is still 1968. In a few places the crazies turned up to tussle with the cops, but otherwise it was a major flop. It had the feel of a party that was wrapping up and only a few hangers-on remain.<br/><br/>The regime is also happy to see the news dominated by the Israel – Iran war, as it provided an excuse to not talk about the Minnesota shooting. They are scrambling to make the shooter into a right-wing wacko, but he was clearly of the left. I would assume the game now is to get him to self-delete so he can never tell anyone why he went on a shooting spree. Let us hope he sent his manifesto to someone with instructions to publicize it after his death.<br/><br/>Of course, the big news is what is happening in the Middle East. This is the biggest test of Trump’s political life because he walked right into an Israeli trick. The whole point of the sneak attack was to create a scenario where he would have no choice but to intervene militarily. Once that happens it is a regional war and something like another Ukraine for the empire. By that I mean a war of attrition to drain the empire of resources.<br/><br/>The Russians and the Chinese understand this, which is why China is sending supplies to Iran. It is not just to protect an important supplier, but a chance to bleed the American empire. There is an opportunity for Trump to wriggle free from this trap, but it will mean confronting some of his Jewish donors who are perfectly fine bleeding the empire white if it means helping Israel. Not an easy path for him, but he brought it on himself.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* More Leftist Violence <br/><br/>* We Wuz Kangz <br/><br/>* More Israeli Bullshit<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.

    desc="Link To Referenced Post: https://firstthings.com/yes-its-our-war-too/<br/><br/>With the usual suspects piling out of their little clown car demanding war, I thought I would talk about this post at First Things and use it as an excuse to figure out how to do a video of my desktop. I have screen captured my desktop for work stuff, but never with audio and never thinking about the quality. I figured it was a good opportunity to learn how to do this form of video.<br/><br/>It is a topical subject. The post in question is from last week and about Ukraine, but it captures the hive mind behind all of these wars. George Weigel imagines himself as a modern-day Aquinas, except that he only argues for war. Alternatively, he imagines himself standing in front of a crowd, waving the Bible around, getting the crowd worked up over the latest appearance of Old Scratch.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that most of the war mongers are Jewish, there is a strong old time Protestant preacher vibe to their arguments. They never make rational arguments with facts and reason. They make emotional appeals. You are not a sinner, so you will not stand by and let evil triumph will you? Of course not! Therefore, you have a moral duty to go out and die for their mortal crusade.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="A little bonus content. I decided to express my inner Bill Murray from Cady Shack and take on the deer. I was just going to roll with it, but Gaia has been pushing her luck lately with all the rain, so I decided to raise the stakes. A trip to the hardware store got me fifty feet of chicken wire and ten posts, plus some weird little clip things that I spent an hour trying to understand. I gave up and used zip ties.<br/><br/>The next step, of course, will be plastic explosives. I am hoping it does not come to that, but in the spirit of the times, I am down for escalatory violence. The deer are weeks from getting a bomb. On the other hand, I am pretty sure the culprit was the little fawn that sleeps in the woods behind the garden and gets my cats excited in the morning. She lost her mother, but she is hanging in there so far.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing. Leave a comment or share this episode."

    desc="The Orange Man pushed the big red button to maybe kick off another war or maybe fake his way out of a trap designed to drag America into a war. It is hard to know at this point, but we can conclude that Trump very much wanted a no war option. This limited attack seems to be the middle track between what the Jews are demanding and what his base is expecting. Time will tell if the Jews are satisfied with the result, but we all know how that goes.<br/><br/>As of this morning, Israel was firing missiles at Iran and Iran was firing missiles at Israel. There is rare video out of Israel showing a lot of damage to a building that was allegedly their biowarfare facility, which raises many questions. Not only does Israel have a secret nuclear arsenal and a plan to use it against the world if threatened, but they may also have biological weapons they could unleash to bring about a 13 Monkeys scenario. It would explain a lot.<br/><br/>That aside, the Iranians have said they will close the Strait of Hormuz in response, but that can mean a lot of things, so we shall have to wait and see. The trouble for Trump is the Iranians have no reason to believe anything he says now, so they have no choice but to assume more attacks are coming and regime change remains the goal. They have to act as if they are in a war for survival against the Great Satan and its masters in the Levant.<br/><br/>For those interested, here is a paper written by someone who went on to spend time in clandestine operations in the Muslim world until recently. It is a bit dated, but it provides some useful background on how the Iranians go about their business. We might have him on the Wednesday show or maybe I will interview him for the Friday show. Since it looks like this will be a long war with Iran, everyone now has to find Iran experts they can trust to explain things.<br/><br/>Topics<br/><br/>* War!<br/><br/>* Master Trolling <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for subscribing.
