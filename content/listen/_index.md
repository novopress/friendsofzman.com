## Z Blog Power Hour

The [*Z Blog Power Hour*](/listen/podcast) ran for 373 episodes from July 2017 to 2025. It was **Z Man**'s predominant outlet for monologues and weekly roundups. It dropped every Friday for seven years, and when it didn't, it was because he announced ahead of time that he was skipping a week for a holiday. Like his written output, this podcast published like clockwork.

To my knowledge, there was never a guest. It was just **Z Man** reflecting on the week or excavating insights from his broad understanding of political history. 

About half the episodes are topical to the week, and the other half are perennial. But they were always thoughtful, sober, and cut through the sensationalism and spectacle of the daily news cycle.

## Premium 

**Z Man**'s paying subscribers were treated to exclusive 30-minute podcasts on Sunday. They ran for 152 episodes between July 2022 and June 2025.

These episodes were more conversational and personal: discussing his move from "Lagos," his budding garden, etc. They gave the listener a sense of the man himself and how he spent his time. They are the most intimate expressions from **Z Man**.

He described these episodes as "[Behind the Green Door](/listen/premium)," and after revealing his face in 2025, started filming short (10-minute) video segments for them as well.

## Guest Appearances

**Z Man**'s most significant guest appearance was as a speaker at the American Renaissance (AmRen) 2022 Conference. He was still pseudonymous at the time, and to AmRen's credit, they videotaped the speech but didn't publicly release it until after his death.

He also revealed his face publicly for the *RamZPaul Show*, on which he appeared weekly in 2025 until his untimely death.
