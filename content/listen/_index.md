**Z Man**â€™s podcast, the *Z Blog Power Hour*, ran for 373 episodes from July 2017 to June 2025. For paid subscribers, he also released 152 additional episodes between July 2022 and June 2025.

There were also a number of guest appearances on other podcasts, which @AJCement helped to identify. They are all audio until he started recording with RamZPaul in 2025, when he revealed his face for those video streams.

## Featured Episodes

### Z Blog Power Hour

The *Z Blog Power Hour* was **Z Man**'s predominant outlet for monologues and weekly roundups. It dropped every Friday for seven years, and when it didn't, it was because he announced ahead of time that he was skipping a week for a holiday. Like his written output, this podcast published like clockwork.

To my knowledge, there as never a guest. It was just **Z Man** reflecting on the week, or excavating insights from his broad understanding of political history. 

About half the episodes are topical to the week, and the other half are perennial. But they were always thoughtful, sober, and cut through the sensationalism and spectacle of the daily news cycle.

### Premium

Paid subscribers were treated to exclusive 30-minute podcasts on Sunday. These were more conversational and sometimes more personal, discussing his move from "Lagos," his budding garden, etc. They gave you a sense of the man himself, and how he spent his time.

He described these episodes as "Behind the Green Door," and after revealing his face in 2025, started filming short (10-minute) video segments for them as well.

These are the most intimate expressions from **Z Man**.

### Guest Appearances

**Z Man**'s most significant guest appearance was as a speaker at the American Renaissance (AmRen) 2022 Conference. He was still pseudonymous at the time, and to AmRen's credit, they videotaped the speech but didn't publicly release it until after his death.

He also revealed his face publicly for the *RamZPaul Show*, on which he appeared weekly in 2025 until his untimely death.
