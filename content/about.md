This is the **Z**archive -- a website dedicated to the late & great **Z Man**, *aka* Christopher Zeeman, *aka* John Christopher Zander.

At the time of his untimely death in June 2025, **Z Man** was the most prolific political pundit in America. He wrote an insightful and topical article every day, for over ten years, and published an hour-long podcast every week without fail.

His articles were published to [thezman.com](https://thezman.com), but he later adopted [Substack](thedissident.substack.com) to post his free and premium articles and videos online.

Here, we've collected as much of **Z Man**'s output as reasonably possible. Before his unexpected passing, he treated us to a new perspective every day, and we want to give these back to you.

In the navigation menu, you'll find links to his Articles, Videos, Appearances, and Memorials.
