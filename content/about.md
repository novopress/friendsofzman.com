The **Zarchive** is dedicated to the late John Christopher Zander, known online as Christopher Zeeman or the **Z Man**.

At the time of his untimely death in June 2025, **Z Man** was the most prolific political pundit in America. He wrote an insightful and topical article every day for over ten years, and published an hour-long podcast every week without fail.

His articles were originally published to *[thezman.com](https://thezman.com)*, but he later adopted *[Substack](thedissident.substack.com)* to also publish premium (paywalled) articles and videos online.

We've collected here as much of **Z Man**'s output as reasonably possible, and hope you enjoy spending time with his work as much as we have.
