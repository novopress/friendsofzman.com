With heavy hearts, we announce the passing of John Christopher "Chris" Zander, who passed away on June 26, 2025, at the age of 59, in Berkeley Springs. Chris was a brilliant, studious soul whose passion for knowledge, writing, and politics left an indelible mark on his community and beyond.

Born on January 16, 1966, in Chesapeake, VA, Chris spent his early years listening to the wisdom of his grandfather, who he loved and admired. Through his grandfather, he carried a lifelong love for learning and engagement. Chris was a tireless reader, particularly of history. As a young man he left Virginia for Loyola High School and then moved to Boston after graduating. While in Boston, he met many lifelong friends. He attended Boston College, where he became a devoted fan of the BC Eagles. In the early days of the internet, Chris created a chat group dedicated to Big East football, where his insights rivaled those of professional sportswriters.

Over time, Chris’ interests drifted away from sports, to politics and technology. He became a successful software engineer and businessman. Using the nom de plume “The Z-Man” he emerged as a popular voice and critic in the comment sections of early political web sites. Encouraged by the feedback he received, he created his own web site, “The Z Blog”, where his sharp insights and warm humor always shone through. His ability to weave ideas into compelling narratives earned him a dedicated following. He was particularly proud of the feedback from his many readers, who he called the “the smartest comment section on the internet”.

Later, he created a popular weekly podcast, “The Z-Man Power Hour” home of the always popular “Xirl Science” segment. His hard work and natural talent earned him recognition from senior thought leaders, and he was frequently invited to speak and write for websites, podcasts, Youtube channels, and conferences.

As a cherished uncle and friend, Chris was known for his intellect, wit, and tireless dedication to his craft. He loved travelling with friends on sports trips, following Mark McGuire or the New England Patriots to new cities.

Chris is survived by his niece, Stephanie Zander-Sexton, who will carry forward his legacy of curiosity and kindness. He was preceded in death by his father John William Zander; his mother, Dyan Louis Sparks; and his brother, Jeffrey Allen Zander. His voice, preserved in his writings and podcast episodes, will continue to inspire all who knew him or followed his work.

Funeral mass will be held at the St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church,67 Liberty St, Berkeley Springs on Thursday July 10, 2025 at 10am. Interment will follow. Officiating will be Rev. J. Stephen Vallelonga. A Celebration of Life gathering will be held at the Berkeley Springs Castle immediate follow the Committal.

In lieu of flowers, donations in Chris’s memory may be made to organizations he supported, including AmRen and VDARE.
