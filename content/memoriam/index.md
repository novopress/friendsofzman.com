## Cohorts

J. Burden, [June 27, 2025](https://x.com/_jburden/status/1938569813259157955):
> ZMAN was a friend. He will be missed, and may God rest his soul.

John Derbyshire, [June 27, 2025](https://x.com/DissidentRight/status/1938595650762883167):
> My friend, the Z-man (ZMAN, @TheRealZBlog) died Wednesday night or Thursday morning, apparently of natural causes. As well as being a fellow dissident, Chris was a keen & very helpful supporter of my own efforts. He edited and hosted Radio Derb at his website https://thezman.com/wordpress/ from the destruction of http://VDARE.COM last July to June 6th this year, when I retired. Rest in peace, Z.

Paul Kersey, [June 26, 2025](https://x.com/BWLH_/status/1938400580784799984):
> ZMAN would have made a hell of a History and Moral Philosophy instructor. He knew how late the hour was, and yearned for creating the conditions where being a citizen and entrusted with the franchise mattered again. The age of democracy is ending. He did his part. RIP.

Charles Haywood, [June 28, 2025](https://x.com/TheWorthyHouse/status/1938943167933358366):
> Z-Man, maybe seven years ago, when my site was tiny, put my blog on his blogroll.  I was always grateful for the boost.  He was a good man.

Jared Taylor, [June 27, 2025](https://x.com/RealJarTaylor/status/1938606570939846842):
> Z-man was a comrade of many years and an AmRen conference speaker. He was not even 60 years old. His death is a great shock.

Pete Quinones, [June 26, 2025](https://x.com/PeterRQuinones/status/1938436933933482223):
> We shared many drinks over several conferences. This was the first one we hung out at. My wife and I are crushed. @TheRealZBlog  will be missed. RIP brother.

William M Briggs, [July 10, 2025](https://x.com/FamedCelebrity/status/1943449937120801160):
> Report from a mutual who was at Zman's funeral mass: The service was well done.  Very well attended given Berkeley Springs is a little out of the way.  Jared Taylor and Peter Brimelow were there along with a bunch of his college buddies that served as pallbearers.  Not sure if  "Mr. Pink" was the one that gave the eulogy, but it nicely focused on his "non-Zman" life.  Brimelow brought up an apparent Russian tradition of everyone putting a white rose on the casket at the gravesite-and helpfully brought a big box of them.  Thought that was a meaningful touch.  I would have brought a bottle of Triple  8 vodka--used to send him a bottle every 100th show.  Unfortunately had to leave after the interment as had some personal business to attend to so did not make it to the Castle . But you really got a sense of what a Renaissance man he was--school apartment had little furniture, but books piled everywhere, even then.  Will be a big hole to plug.  Though I never met him, read his blog going back to maybe 2014 and the podcast was a staple for the Friday morning rucks. We'll all miss him.  A lot.

John Carter, [June 28, 2025](https://x.com/martianwyrdlord/status/1938986244106534921):
> Absolutely crushing to lose him like this, so suddenly, and at such a young age. I've been reading ZMan for years - he played a key role in the development of the online right, starting with the revolts against cuckservatism in the trenches of the National Review's comments section, and then with the commentary and analysis he posted on his own blog. The man was a treasure and we're all impoverished without his voice.

## Criticism

For posterity, we note that [David Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cole_(journalist)), Jewish author and infamous Holocaust denier, alleged after Z Man's death that he was a plaigerist. For a period, they both worked (remotely) for Taki's Magazine, before Z Man's articles were abruptly purged. In response to the allegation, William M Briggs asked for evidence and was immediately blocked by Cole. Briggs attempted to validate the accusation of plaigerism by feeding a few articles into online plaigerism detectors, and only detected instances of others quoting Z Man himself, except for one anonymous forum poster which may have been Z Man himself.
