On YouTube there is a genre of video about living off-grid. That is,
living in a rural area without electricity, gas, internet and so on.
Many, if not most, are fake because most everything is fake these days.
Some are legitimate and they make for interesting viewing because it is
mostly problem solving. Watching a guy noodle through how to make a tiny
hydroelectric system is interesting.

There is also the appeal of disconnecting from the modern age. Consume
the mass media for even a short time, like when putting together a
podcast, and the appeal of off-grid living is obvious. Imagine a world
where the liars have to hike into the forest in order to lie to you
about something. You are fixing up you hut and some guy shows up to tell
you about something called deniers.

That would not happen, which is the appeal of dropping out. Given the
popularity of these videos, there must be a fair number of people
thinking about it. Of course, YouTube stats are all fake too, but there
are lots of books on the various aspects of off-grid living, so it seems
to be a real thing. There is still a lot of empty land in America, so
dropping out is not as impractical as it sounds initially.

On the other hand, The corollary to the Timothy Leary line, “Turn On,
Tune In, Drop Out” is “Turn Off, Tune Out and Drop Out.” You do not have
to move to the forest to disconnect from the grid. You can just drop
your media connections, stop following current events and busy yourself
with old fashioned hobbies. You can drop out while remaining in the
regular world.

The challenge there is that the liars can easily get to you. Instead of
consuming popular culture you take up woodworking, but then you start
noticing that your favorite wood working sites now have rainbow flags on
them. We are saturated in party messaging so if you have any presence on
the grid, you will be infected by it. There is no where to hide in the
grid from the lunatics and their lunacy.
