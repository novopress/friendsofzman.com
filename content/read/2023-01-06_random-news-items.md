I had to record the show on Wednesday evening as I had things to do on
Thursday, so I was left to guess about the Kevin McCarthy drama. My
guess from the start was that this would go on for as long the sides had
breath in their lungs, because it has nothing to do with issues and
everything to do with personality. Those opposed to McCarthy simply
detest the man for who he is and that is not changing.

What is remarkable about this is how willing the rest of the party is to
tell their voters how much they detest them. By supporting this bozo,
they are giving the finger to their voters in the most obvious way. The
angry one-eyed dwarf calling the holdouts “terrorists” is why people are
sick of the Republican Party. The party of John McCain is the main
reason for the present crisis.

This has been an unexpected boost to our side to start the year. The
goofballs in conservative media have taken this opportunity to remind
everyone that they are just as loathsome as the party they support. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> we have some of the Fox News
actors calling the hold outs insurrectionists. Then they had Anthony
Weiner’s best bud
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hF5aw5K9-Q" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">attack</a> Lauren Boebert in a live interview.
Hilarious.

The best part about this is the party has an easy way out of this jam.
They could dump McCarthy and find someone that is not hated, but instead
they are rallying around the establishment flag. Even better is that
whatever deal they eventually cut with the holdouts will be immediately
broken. The party of finks will figure out a way to fink on themselves
in the finkiest way possible.
