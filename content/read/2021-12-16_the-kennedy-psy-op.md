Who “really” killed President John F Kennedy over a half century ago may
be the first modern conspiracy theory. Few people accept the official
explanation from the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald did the
deed on his own. Most assume he had help from some powerful friends. The
Mafia is a popular theory since one of their associates assassinated
Oswald soon after. Jack Ruby’s role in this whole thing never made much
sense, given his lifestyle.

For generations now the government has kept a massive trove of files
hidden away from public view, which has driven speculation about their
contents. There is no reason for these documents to remain secret, given
that everyone involved is now dead and the Cold War is long over. In
1992 the Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act was passed by
Congress. The act called for the release of the secret Kennedy files
within 25 years, but Trump set the deadline aside.

Typical Trump, he promised to release all of the documents, but then
turned around did the opposite. In most cases, these reversals were the
result of Trump being an outlandish liar, but in this case, it was
pressure from the FBI and CIA. Their claim is that the thousands of
documents locked away in the archives contain secrets that could
endanger people and methods. The absurdity of these claims is never
questioned as everyone is afraid of the secret police.

The people manipulating the corpse of Joe Biden had him
[declare](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/15/jfk-kennedy-assassination-documents-524221)
a restart of the process to release the remaining documents. Some are
supposed to be released this week and then another batch next year.
There is a review process in place and the implication is some things
will never be released. As long as there are documents hidden from
public view, the assumption is the truth is not known. On the other
hand, that could just be a ploy to keep the conspiracy going.

That is one angle the conspiracy theorists never consider. The real
scandal in the Kennedy case is that the American secret police were so
bungling and incompetent that they missed Oswald despite many red flags.
After all, this is the semi-official explanation for what happened on
9/11. We know the FBI had six million warnings that these people were up
to something involving airplanes. Lost in the aftermath is the fact that
the reason it happened was bureaucratic bungling.

This is one of the main weapons of a secret police unit. They bank on
the opponents of the state wildly overestimating their ability. Fear of
infiltration and detection is how they keep opponents from organizing.
Not only is everyone worried everyone is an informant of infiltrator,
but would-be plotters also think the secret police has special
technology to crack their communications. It is why they pay Hollywood
to make movies about the super smart intelligence agencies with
super-duper spy gear.

If the full story of the Kennedy assassination revealed that the CIA and
FBI was full of hacks and bunglers, that would undermine the agencies.
The texts messages made public in the FBI sedition case in 2016 revealed
that the people at the top of the agency carry on like teenagers most of
the time. If the people running these agencies today are that
incompetent, maybe this has been true since the beginning. Maybe that is
why these documents remain secret.

Of course, it is possible there is nothing there at all. From the
perspective of the state, the assassination created one very big
problem. It called into question the competence of the state. They
needed to show they could solve the mystery. It is possible that they
never did know more than what we have always known. Instead of admitting
it they cooked up the official story and then locked away the “evidence”
to protect their super-secret methods from the bad guys.

This would be another reason to keep the farce going long after everyone
involved is dead and the methods are obsolete. Imagine if the remaining
documents were released and they are just thousands of blank pages and
other useless stuff that have no information at all. Imagine the
conspiracy theorist’s reaction. Imagine the public reaction to the news
of a three generation long hoax. It could be that old lies are still
haunting the regime to this day.

You can work this puzzle another way and wonder about who would not be
hurt at all by some long forgotten bit of information. For example,
would anyone care if the truth in those files is that the Soviets helped
Oswald? The Cubans? The Cold War is over so revelations about long dead
commies harms no one. Given the regime’s obsession with Russia, they
would welcome such a disclosure, so logic says the secret files contain
no incriminating evidence about the Russians.

The point here is that the secret documents probably contain nothing
interesting or revelatory, but their secrecy serves current ends. The
biggest voting bloc in the country right now is white Baby Boomers who
still think about this event. Keeping this story alive helps keep them
engaged with the old idea of America. The Kennedy assassination has been
used as a long running psy-op on this cohort and until they are off the
scene, the psy-op will continue. There is no reason to end it.
