Unless you have been in a cave the last year, you are well aware of the
fact that most of what we call news is just made up. Any story with
“sources say” in it is fictional. The writer simply conjured the sources
and most likely the things they would have said, if they existed. Maybe
someone did say something like what was reported, but the so-called
reporter was not there to hear it. At best, they got it from the gossip
chain or from some C-level talking head, cooling his heels in a cable
television green room.

The worst for this is sports reporting, as they no longer even pretend
to do be doing real reporting. They just make stuff up and slap the
words “according to sources” on it and it is posted as news. Trade
rumors are where you see this all the time. Since the people doing the
deals for the sports clubs are not talking about their business on
camera, the fake news reporters are free to just make up what they want,
so they do. It’s all pitched as “rumors” so when it never happens, the
fake sports reporters can “report” on that.

Even fake news needs content, which is where fake science comes in.
There’s nothing better for a fake news story than a quote from a fake
scientist, especially when the topic is human health. Turn on the local
fake newscast and there’s always at least one fake story on health or
diet. Many of these shows now have a recurring health segment where one
of the bubble heads puts on their serious face and talks into the camera
about some new threat to your health, usually your diet. <a

What the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell does, is not science. Calling it
science is a crime against the language, as well as science. For
instance, they will have participants eat a variety of lunch offerings
and then grade them on their perceived “healthiness.” Naturally,
people get the “wrong” results, because there’s no fixed definition of
“healthy” with regards to food. This allows the “scientist” doing the
study to write a paper claiming that people are brainwashed into picking
the wrong foods or that people need more education on diet.

What this suggests is the people running the place know full well that
all of it is bullshit and nothing close to being real research. Once you
come to accept that, going through the exercise of setting up
dramatizations of real research work probably seems pointless. If you
know the results in advance, the exercise is just silly. What we have
here are adults kitted out in lab gear, live action role playing as a
real scientists at a real lab. Their published work is just for the
purpose of financing their fantasy game.

The root cause of the replication crisis in the soft sciences is mostly
due to the fact that it is it not science. It’s market research. They
try to quantify some behavior in order to pitch an idea already popular
in the mass media or with the managerial class. By slapping the word
“science” on it, they are pitching their role as an authority. Bill Nye,
the toaster repairman, has made a killing claiming to speak for science
on behalf of the cult of Gaia worship. The Cornell Food Lab does the
same thing, but for nutrition and food marketing.

This points to one flaw in Karl Popper’s famous definition of
science. What is *unfalsifiable* is classified as *unscientific*.
Science, according Popper, is that which can be invalidated or
disproved. This sounds good until you look at the Cornell Food Lab.
Everything they do can be invalidated, as almost all of it is nonsense.
Therefore, it meets the definition of science as described by Popper. It
also means that a pseudo-science can easily masquerade as science.

A better, more narrow definition of science is that science concerns
itself with causation. If A causes B then science explains *how* A
causes B. Analysis, on the other hand, points out that whenever we see
B, we often see A, therefore, there is a correlation between A and B.
That’s just observation. Statistical analysis takes observation further
by apply probability to it. It’s not useless and it often aids science,
but it is not science. It’s simply observation and analysis, and more
often than not, pseudo-science.
