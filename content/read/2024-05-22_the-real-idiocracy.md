There has been a lot written and said about the decline of intelligence
in the Western world, mostly focused on the *Idiocracy* side of it.
Everyday life is getting dumber, compounded by the demographic collapse.
Basic processes can easily turn into an ordeal due to stupid people
tasked with operating systems that were designed for operators a
standard deviation smarter than the current crop. What no one thinks too
much about is how this collapse in IQ is impacting the elites.

The dream of the managerial class is to establish themselves as an
unassailable aristocracy that rules over a docile population of workers.
It is why they favor open borders and mass migration as it provides an
unlimited supply of what they imagine to be their ideal helot class.
Even if there are pockets of smart challengers out there among the
teaming masses, they will be too busy dealing with diversity to organize
an opposition to the managerial elite.

This is a good place to start with the decline of elite intelligence. It
is not as if we lack data on this sort of arrangement. The end of
colonialism in Africa, for example, is a great example of how quantity
has a quality of its own. Millions of 80-IQ Africans were able to
overthrow thousands of high-IQ Europeans. Today we see something similar
as the Mizrahi slowly push aside the Ashkenazim in Israel. They are not
as smart as their European tribesman, but they have numbers.

Israel is another good example of what happens to a society when the
intelligence of the ruling elite begins to fade. For a couple of
generations Israel has skillfully manipulated regional politics and
controlled Washington so as to dictate results throughout the Middle
East. With the Gaza operation they have shown themselves to be suddenly
thumbless. The Israeli government has turned a tragic event into a
crisis that threatens its
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfIYtpcBxo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">existence</a>.

Of course, we see the other side of this in America. The people running
foreign policy used to know how to keep Israel on a leash. The Israeli
lobby was constrained by the Jewish economic elite that largely controls
the imperial economy and the neocons who control imperial foreign
policy. The former cared primarily about controlling the global economy
from their perch in New York and the latter cared primarily about their
ancient blood feud with Russia from their perch in Washington.

The Biden administration has managed to make Israeli incompetence and
obstreperousness worse by failing to deal firmly with Netanyahu. The
result is the pathetic scene of the American military building a dock to
supply Gaza with food and water while the IDF blows up schools and
hospitals. Add in the bungling of diplomacy in the region, primarily
with the Saudis, and the American empire is on the cusp of losing all of
its influence in the region.

The clueless bungling with regards to Israel is not confined to the
realm of geopolitics, but also turns up domestically. The Jewish lobby
used to operate in the shadows, nudging key figures behind the scenes to
influence policy. Now it sends out simpletons like Ben Shapiro to demand
the genocide of Palestinians. The actors hired to play the role of
office holders are marched out to read <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">ham-fisted scripts</a> about Israel and
propose <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/americans-serving-in-israeli-army/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">laws</a> that manage to offend decent
Americans.

It is not just with regards to Israel where things are going sideways.
There used to be a time when the Anglo side of the imperial ruling class
understood the reality of the neocons and kept them under control. The
last gasp of this, ironically, was during the Obama years. Maybe it was
that Anglo blood running through the veins of the mulatto mafia that ran
the Obama White House, but they did manage to broker a deal with Iran
and avoid getting sucked into any new wars.

That barrier to neocon excess has collapsed, along with whatever
intelligence that remained within the neocon cult. The result is foreign
policy is now run by a pair of slovenly imbeciles who sit atop the Kagan
cult. One reason for the Israel debacle is the commitment to Project
Ukraine, which itself is becoming a catastrophe that promises to
overwhelm the European part of the American empire. It is impossible to
overstate the stupidity required to think Project Ukraine was a good
idea.

The people who think open borders and mass migration are going to lock
in their position also think Project Ukraine is a winner and marching
the political actors out on stage to swear allegiance to Israel is a
good idea. They also thought it was a good idea to fling open the
prisons so black criminals can run wild in the streets. They thought the
proper response to general unrest among the white population was to
unleash demographic hell on the white middle-class.

It is debatable as to just how much of the general decline in
intelligence is attributable to the decline in the European population
and how much of it is a consequence of the demographic collapse. This is
a big, complicated subject, but what matters most is the general
intelligence of the ruling class. If the ruling class is dominated by
and controlled by the smart fraction and that smart fraction is rooted
in the overall population then society can survive a drop in IQ.

If on the other hand, as we are seeing, the ruling class prides itself
on being alien and hostile to the population and begins to exclude the
smart fraction, even its own smart fraction, then the consequences for
society will be catastrophic. It turns out that the real idiocracy is
not with the general population but among the people who control the
institutions of society. When the people in charge hire
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdIh2A0Gjss" rel="noopener"

representative, the end is near.
