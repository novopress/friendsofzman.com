A lot of conservatives are hoping for a wave election this November.
They still hold out hope that a GOP majority will halt the decay and
mark the turnaround. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story from The Hill</a>
says otherwise.

*It wasn’t part of the jobs message he planned to pitch, but Speaker
John Boehner said Thursday that immigration reform would help boost the
economy.*

*“Immigration reform will help our economy, but you’ve got to secure the
border first,” the Ohio Republican said after a speech at the
conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. “We’ve got a mess
and everyone knows we’ve got a mess.*

*“Our legal system is broken, our border isn’t secure, and we’ve got the
problem of those who are here without documents,” the Speaker continued.
“It needs to be fixed. We’re a nation of immigrants, the sooner we do
it, the better off the country would be.”*

*His immigration comments, in response to an audience question, weren’t
part of his prepared remarks. They followed a 20-minute-speech in which
Boehner laid out his five-point plan to jump-start America’s economy.*

As everyone knows, flooding the nation with new workers will drive up
wages and make everyone richer. All of that twaddle about supply and
demand is just nonsense. It really is incredible how the basics of
economics are thrown out the window when it comes to immigration and
foreign workers.

It is well known that Boehner has a well paid landing spot lined up. He
needs to seal the deal with an amnesty bill. He tried to do it over the
summer, but Obama screwed it up with the Children’s Crusade at the
border. They thought that was a winner, but the backlash made passing
amnesty an act of suicide. After the election, during the lame duck
session, Boehner will bring up an amnesty bill and it will pass.
