On the Sunday show I said I was swearing off any Trump news until the
summer, as there is only so much screeching and squealing, I can take. I
needed to take a break in order to train for the coming election. I plan
to stick to that for the most part but looking at the clips of Trump
stopping into a Chick-fil-A and the reaction to it, I thought it may be
a good time to talk about the meaning of Trump.

Almost ten years ago now Trump entered the political arena, and nothing
has been the same since, which is a remarkable thing by itself. If upon
the elevation of Barak Obama to the presidency you had said that the
reaction to this event will be Donald Trump swinging a wrecking ball
through Washington and our politics, people would have assumed you had
lost your mind.

Nonetheless, here we are, and that wrecking ball is about to take what
will probably be its last swing through the system. I remain skeptical
about Trump’s chances of winning in November, but I did not think he
would make it this long. The reason is our managerial class hates what
the man represents to the point where they have come to define
themselves by that hatred.

That is the point of the show this week. I pulled together the various
points about this I have made over the years, as to why they hate Trump.
When you realize that Trump is a symptom, this last decade becomes a
useful way of understanding not only the hysteria around Trump but why
things are such a mess in general. Trump is the scourge sent by the gods
to punish the managerial class.
