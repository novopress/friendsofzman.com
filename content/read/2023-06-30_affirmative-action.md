This week I thought it would be useful to talk about the Supreme Court
case regarding affirmative action in college admissions. As I pointed
out on Gab and Twitter, the ruling is a big nothing burger when you read
it. Schools cannot come right out and say they are not taking Whites or
Asians, but they can still discriminate to their heart’s desire as long
as they frame as a character evaluation.

Judge Roberts wrote, “nothing prohibits universities from considering an
applicant’s discussion of how race affected the applicant’s life, so
long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or
unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the
university.” Colleges will no doubt read this as a license to go crazy
with their antiwhite agendas.

I did not cover this in the show, but this case is a good reminder that
words on paper will never constrain a ruling class. The letter of the
law means nothing to people who have no respect for the spirit of the
law. Right now, our ruling class has no respect for the rules that are
supposed to govern Western societies. No amount of ink spilling will
cause them to change their minds about it.

Another thing worth mentioning that I did not cover in the show is the
implied cowardice in these cases. When the Left had the whip hand on the
court, they rammed through as much as they could as fast as they could.
When the Right has control of the courts it is nothing but baby steps
and concessions to the Left. This recent case was a chance to roll back
a lot of horrible ideas, but they cucked.

This removes the last argument for voting Republican. We know that when
they have control of Congress they will fink on their voters. When they
have control of the White House, they will appoint people like John
Roberts to the bench. Even with a stacked court the people who vote
Republican cannot expect to get anything for their support, so what is
the point of voting for a Republican?
