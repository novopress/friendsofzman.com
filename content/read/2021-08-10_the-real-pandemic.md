It is very difficult to assess what is happening in a revolutionary
moment, because things seem to change so quickly. Looking back, the
French Revolution is easier to understand, because we know how it ended.
We can look at the events in the context of Napoleon or the Terror. The
same is true of the Bolshevik Revolution, that came to a similar end. In
fact, putting the two together makes it possible to understand things
about both that the people at the time could never know.

This is a useful thing to keep in mind in this age, as the radicals push
the revolution forward, for reasons they don’t comprehend. Legacy
conservatives will keep trying to jam these events into the obsolete
world view, blaming things on the lust for power or a desire to take
your money. Others will blame it on nefarious actors like George Soros,
because that is the easy thing to do. Blaming a a single bad actor or
groups of actors makes things simple for the simple-minded.

In reality, in revolutionary times, men are like people swept up in a
great flood, carried along by the forces of nature. They look for things
to hang onto in order to escape being swept away, like their own
ideological mindset. The revolutionaries are no different in this regard
but they convince themselves they are the ones driving the river, when
all they have done is unleash the floodgates. They are as much a victim
of their own zealous lunacy as the people they oppose.

An example is [this
story](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article253321358.html)
about the city of Charlotte. The city is passing a nondiscrimination
ordinance that will protect “gender identity, gender expression, sexual
orientation and natural hairstyles.” Since all of those things are
meaningless word salad, they have, in effect, banned everything and
nothing. The term “natural hairstyles” is a cult-Marx term for black
women with afros, but otherwise the rest of it just means whatever the
mentally ill can conjure next.

The people behind this stuff know that these words and therefore the law
is nonsense, but they also know that is the point. They have been
trained up in the latest cult-Marx dogma which says they must subvert
expectations and undermine the prevailing cultural orthodoxies. They may
or may now know what any of that means, but they know enough to know
chaos is the order of the day. These terms are all moral signifiers,
justifying an all-out assault on cultural norms.

Again, the usual suspects will try to assign specific rational
explanations for why they are trying to sow chaos, but that sort of
reductionism misses the point. The chaos is the point of all this, as
the goal is to smash the cultural orthodoxy. Essential to Nth wave
Marxism is the belief that culture is what prevents the natural rise of
socialism, so if you destroy the culture, a new socialist order will
arise. More important, a new socialist man will rise from the wreckage
of white supremacist society.

Like original Marxism, this is nonsense. It is worse than nonsense, in
that it is an esoteric religion that flatters the believer by replacing
their reality with the promise of special insight. Once you come to
believe that wrecking the present order will usher in the great
revolution of mankind, you are now in a special club of people who have
found the answer to the great question. The irrationality of it is the
draw. It appeals to that natural need to believe that is a key trait of
man.

What we are living through is a revolution pushed along by people who
are sure they are creating conditions for the great liberation. The
details of that great liberation and how it will come into existence are
just assumed. This was always the appeal of the original Marxism. It
provided a childish vison of a glorious future, onto which the believer
could project his fantasy vision of the future. Then it supplied a story
of history that claimed the glorious future was an historical
inevitability.

This the core of Cultural Marxism. Because of the demographic changes in
the West, it has been repackaged along racial lines. Instead of
destroying bourgeoise culture they are set on destroying white culture.
This has obvious appeal to people who came to the West for the free
stuff but find that the cost of that free stuff is the abandonment of
their old ways. For blacks, of course, it means they get to taste the
vengeance that has been promised to them since the last century.

In the lab, this stuff sounds appealing, but when you go around smashing
the culture, there is no guarantee what will happen next. The culture
tends to restrain the worst passions of the people who produced it. Once
those restraints are gone, those passions are released to mix with the
passion of the zealots who did the smashing. Imagine an Antifa rally
without police protection. All of a sudden, the people who defunded the
police discover a truth hidden in their revolutionary furor.

This is why making sense of the revolution is only worthwhile as a way
to get a glimpse of what comes next. History shows that the people
driving these events are like the coronavirus of the present moment. All
efforts to mitigate it result in a mutation that gets around the
mitigation. All you can do is prepare for what comes after it has done
its worst to the host population. Then maybe you can have a chance to
rebuild with an eye on preventing any future outbreaks of this
pestilence.
