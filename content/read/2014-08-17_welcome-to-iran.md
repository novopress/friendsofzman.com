One of the most dangerous people in a modern democracy is someone that
enjoys making fun of the people in charge. A king can be generous with
the jester, as no one doubts who is king. Even depots can be indifferent
to criticism from the mobs, because they have no power. The rulers of a
democracy have to pretend to respect public opinion, so they hate the
jester. it’s why the liberal scolds are now <a

Gavin McInnes, trying to de-platform him.

*Gavin McInnes, chief creative officer of Rooster in New York, has been
asked to take an indefinite leave of absence following the publication
of a transphobic essay.*

*Published earlier this week on Thought Catalog, “Transphobia is
Perfectly Natural” has at publication received 2,082 comments. It has
also sparked a “Boycott Rooster” movement, with Tumblr and Twitter
accounts asking followers to let Rooster clients—Vans, Red Bull, Fox
Sports and others—know they will not support companies that work with
McInnes.*

*“Gavin’s views are his own and do not represent those of the company or
its members,” said a Rooster representative. “We are extremely
disappointed with his actions and have asked that he take a leave of
absence while we determine the most appropriate course of action.”*

*McInnes co-founded Rooster in 2010 as an agency that would make ads for
people who hate ads. He has appeared in the shop’s work for Vans, most
recently as the man who explains how to do absolutely everything.*

*Prior to that, he co-founded Vice Magazine. McInnes has made
controversial comments publicly before, with essays on Thought Catalog
and contributions to Fox News. Though, due to the tone of his work, some
are unsure if it is meant to be taken seriously.*

*McInnes could not be reached for comment.*

If you go to the site where the article is published, you get this
message:

*The article you are trying to read has been reported by the community
as hateful or abusive content. For more information about our reporting

By the “community” they mean entitled weirdos and deviants.

The fact is we have reached some sort of tipping point. Sex is a
biological reality, not a social construct. Humans are either male or
female and that’s determined by genetics, not “assigned at birth.” The
people butchering themselves to change their sex are not doing anything
but butchering themselves. They suffer from a form of mental illness and
should be treated as such.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotemnophilia"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apotemnophilia</a> is treated
as a mental disorder and that’s not materially different from what the
“trans” people suffer.

Of course, this is not about biological reality. It is about fanatics
trying to force their morality on the rest of us. This pagan cult we
call liberalism is no different from the Muslim lunatics running Iran.
They lack the ability to behead heretics in public, but that is not a
permanent condition. Since they cannot murder McInnes, they will do the
next best thing and that’s ostracize him. If he loses his job, they know
the next guy will censure himself so as to avoid the same fate.

This madness cannot hold forever. Boys cannot become girls and two guys
playing house is not marriage. If these obvious realities cannot be
spoken in public, what other realities must be ignored? At what point
does this disconnect from observable reality become untenable?  When do
normal people stop ignoring these lunatics and begin to push back? Or,
are we headed for the same fate as Iran?

The truth is, this sort of thuggery always leads to pushing around the
wrong person, who then shoots one of the thugs. The thugs then ramp up
their pogroms and more thug-murderers are born. Create enough people
with nothing left to lose and they stop abiding by the rules that permit
you to push them around. The only way forward is the intolerance we see
in a place like Iran. The mullahs must always be paranoid of the people,
else risk their revenge.
