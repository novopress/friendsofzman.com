Happy Juneteenth everyone! Officially, this long tradition dating back
to Monday is celebrated on Saturday, but the ruling regime has declared
the preceding Friday as a day off for our hardworking civil servants.
The rest of us, of course, will have to continue slaving away at the
salt mines, but the people who really make this country work will get
the day off to celebrate the people who built the country. Even as we
toil, we should take a moment to think about both groups.

In a way, the ridiculousness of this new holiday fits perfectly with the
absurdity of modern liberal democracy. The show this week is mostly
about how the system is nothing like it is claimed. Instead of bringing
the citizens into the decision making process, it systematically
excludes the majority. This new holiday is a great example of how it
works. Exactly no one wanted it. Few even heard of it. The people have
many higher concerns, but they are ignored in favor of this novelty.

It is also good timing for Charles Murray’s
<a href="https://www.encounterbooks.com/books/facing-reality/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">new book</a>. The thesis of the book is
that the elites need to accept biological reality or face the wrath of
the angry Saxon. This new holiday is a good example of what he means.
Ruling class whites pandering to blacks creates friction between whites
and blacks over trivial items. It encourages nonwhites to embrace tribal
politics, which discourages whites from embracing the active
indifference necessary to make a multiracial society work.

There are other things wrong with Murray’s argument. The great Roger
Devlin has posted a <a
href="https://vdare.com/articles/charles-murray-s-facing-reality-ruling-class-must-accept-race-differences-or-provoke-the-disaster-of-white-identity-politics"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">comprehensive review</a> on VDare. There
will be other reviews from dissidents in the coming weeks. Ed Dutton may
have summarized it best when he said that Murray is right, but he should
have written this book in 1965 or even 1985. At this point, the die is
cast and there is no escaping the thing he is warning against. The fact
that Washington just created this absurd new holiday is proof of that.

Of course, the fact that both parties eagerly embraced this idiotic idea
makes clear that the elites will never face reality on their own.
History says they will have their awakening as the trap door swings
open. The system we have today is unsustainable, for the simple reason
the people at the top define themselves by their hatred of the people
over whom the rule. Most of the pols who voted for this new holiday did
so out of spite and the rests did so to curry favor with those spiteful
mutants.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
