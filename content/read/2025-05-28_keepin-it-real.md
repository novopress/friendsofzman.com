The first four months of the Trump restoration have exceeded everyone’s
expectations for no other reason than it has shifted the conversation.
The bad guys are still battling everything in the courts and Congress,
but unlike the first time, Trump seems to have a plan, and he has been
aggressive in executing it. As a result, he has been setting the agenda
rather than the bad guys. The one place where he is failing is with
Ukraine, where it looks like he has painted himself into a corner.

When Trump came to power, the choices with regards to Ukraine were to
either abandon the whole thing and get blamed for tanks in Kiev or
continue the Biden policy and get blamed for tanks in Kiev. To his
credit he tried to shake things up by talking directly to the Russians
and bypassing the snakes in the foreign policy community while doing it,
in an effort to reset the board. Clearly, the snakes and the bad guys
did not see that coming, so they were unprepared for it.

The problem is that the facts on the ground have not changed, so there
is no deal Trump can make with the Russians to end the war. Zelensky
will never do any peace deal as that means the end of him. The
nationalists in Ukraine will never accept a deal, which is why Zelensky
cannot do a deal. The Europeans seem convinced that peace in Ukraine
means the withdraw of America from Europe, so they are fighting like
hell to keep the war going, even as it harms their positions.

Now it seems clear that the Russians have understood from the start that
Trump was never willing to break with the Europeans or take on the
crazies in Washington who created the Ukraine mess. They were happy to
talk with him, but they knew there was nothing he could offer them, as
he was simply unwilling or maybe unable to do what is necessary to get a
deal done with them. That means peace comes when Ukraine can no longer
fight and the Russians dictate terms.

That is probably why Trump is so
<a href="https://archive.is/LUNZv" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">angry</a>. He probably understood his dilemma, but for
some reason thought he could charm his friend Putin into yielding on
some things in order to get a deal done. This was a serious error.
Russians have been known for centuries as unyielding negotiators. They
never trade what they have for something they already have or are about
to have. They always deal from their interests, never personal vanity or
out of a need to get along.

The best example of this is the Hitler-Stalin pact. Stalin was a
Bolshevik, and he detested the fascists, but Russia was not ready to
fight the Nazis, so Stalin did a deal to buy time, even if it meant
doing a deal with the hated Nazis. Stalin was also willing to make deals
with the capitalists, because it served Russian interests. The point
here is even at the peak of their ideological fervor, the Russians still
did diplomacy like Russians, which means in the interest of Russia.

For some reason Trump and Witkoff seemed to have thought they could talk
the Putin government out of being Russian, but now they are finding out
that their charm offensives changed nothing. The position of the
Russians has not changed with regards to Ukraine and the West. They want
Ukraine as a demilitarized, deradicalized neutral state with no
connection to NATO. They will get that at the bargaining table, or they
will get that on the battlefield.

Trump also suffers from the fact that the rest of the world no longer
trusts Washington, no matter who is in the White House. The thing many
Americans struggle with when it comes to foreign policy is that the same
people who have been lying to us for decades have been lying to the
world. The people who ran the Biden admin were not suddenly honest when
it came to diplomacy. The American political class lies about everything
to everyone, even themselves.

In a way, Trump and his team are the new management of a company that
used to be a dominant player in the market but after years of
mismanagement is now in trouble, which is why there is new management.
They can go to their customers and promise things will change, but the
customers are under no illusions that new faces will solve the problems
of the company. In fact, the new promises after years of broken promises
just raise more suspicions about the company.

That is probably part of Trump’s frustration. He is being treated by
world leaders as a guy who lies all the time, when he is not the guy who
did the lying. It is the other side of being an American. There are good
things that are associated with being an American, things like
confidence and risk taking. The other side of the coin is the bad
things, like dishonestly and unreliability. It is why the only thing
worse than being the enemy of America is being the friend of America.

Even though there are hints of realism creeping into official foreign
policy discussions, we remain a long way from a realistic foreign
policy. Trump and his team are still making the mistake of thinking the
world looks at America as the good guy, the white hat trying to make the
world a safer place for democracy. In reality, the rest of the world
views America as either a thumbless clod or a perfidious troublemaker.
The Russians lean heavily toward the latter type.

Ironically, Trump finds himself in the inverse position as his hero
Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War. Regan would say, “Trust but
verify” when dealing with the Soviets, on the grounds that the West kept
its word. It was assumed that the communists would cheat, just like they
did at the Olympics. Now the roles are reversed, and it is the Russians
who assume they will keep their end of the deal, but it is the West that
will eventually break the deal.

This is the reality of late empire America. The emerging world order
where major regional powers work to keep the peace is the result of the
lone superpower failing to hold up its end of the bargain. The alien
weirdos who gained control of foreign policy traded American respect and
credibility so they could seek revenge on their ancient enemy to the
east. The result is America has a lot of work to do in order to restore
her reputation and that will require a mighty dose of realism.
