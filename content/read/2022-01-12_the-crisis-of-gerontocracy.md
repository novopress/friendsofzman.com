Anyone who has had to plan for the departure of a long time employee or
co-worker knows that it is more than just replacing their work product.
People who have been in an organization for a long time have a gravity
to them. Their personal style, their way of going about their business,
changes the work habits of those around them, so when they leave lots of
things will change. There are unknown unknowns that you can never
account for, but you can anticipate to some degree.

This is something indirectly raised in this Wall Street Journal
<a href="https://archive.is/RkdFa" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> about the possible return of Hillary Clinton.
The authors are long-serving political operatives tied to the Clinton
political machine, so it is not unreasonable to assume they were
instructed to write this and get it posted in regime media. They picked
the Wall Street Journal because it speaks to the right-wing of the
political elite. The idea is to position Hillary Clinton, of all people,
as a unifier of sorts.

There is a bit of the old Clinton triangulation going on here. The way
this works is the left-side of the political class led the charge to get
rid of Trump, but they are fumbling badly and upsetting the right side
of the political class. The threat of Trump running in 2024 rustles them
even more than a demented Biden staggering on for another term, but it
is a close call. The answer, so the theory goes, is the old familiar
Hillary Clinton, who will play ball with both sides.

The problem, of course, is Clinton is 74, which may be the springtime of
youth compared to the rest of the political elite, but it is still old.
People forget that Clinton was in rough shape when she ran in 2016. She
mysteriously disappeared from the public eye for a while and had the
incident where she collapsed on the street. She was also wearing some
sort of contraption that was never explained. Time heals all wounds, but
only in the emotional sense, not the physical sense.

In fairness, Donald Trump is 75, so he is not exactly the youthful
alternative to the gerontocracy that currently runs the country. The
thing is though, he is a vigorous man for his age and has shown no signs
of slowing down. One thing that went unnoticed is unlike other
presidents, Trump did not suddenly get old while in office. He seemed to
grow stronger off the endless battling. His father was supposedly quite
vigorous into his 90’s and Trump appears to have inherited those genes.

Again, the authors of that post are attached to the Clinton machine so
they did not just dream that up for the fun of it. They make clear that
Clinton is beginning the process of mounting a campaign. It could mean
running against Biden in the primary, which would not go over well with
the Obama wing or the Sanders wing, so they are beginning the process of
normalizing the idea so it is not an issue. Clinton will position
herself as the moderate trying to save the party from Biden.

Of course, this is another example of how the political class is
unwilling to look forward so it instead tries to reboot old ideas. They
Republicans plan to run their midterm campaign as a reboot of the Newt
Gingrich show from the 1990’s and now Hillary Clinton is imagining
herself as Ted Kennedy in 1980. Forty years ago, the left-wing of the
party was sure that the reason Reagan won in 1980 is the old guard of
the party refused to jettison Carter in favor of Kennedy.

It speaks to the bankruptcy of the political class that they keep
indulging in these weird walks down memory lane. Within living memory
politicians would run on specific agendas, tied closely to things that
were important to people. Biden ran on not being Trump and now Hillary
plans to run on not being Trump or Biden. Elections have always been
beauty contents, but now they have been stripped of their talent
portion, leaving us with the terrifying image of geezers in swimsuits.

The actuarial tables are immutable. Whoever is calling the shots in both
parties will eventually have to move on from the geezers. If Trump runs
and wins in 2024, he serves one term. Who is the next man up? If Hillary
runs and wins, she could serve two terms, but that means living to 84.
It also means not getting the Joe Biden treatment after one term. Who is
being prepared on the Democrat side to take over for the collection of
geezers now in charge?

The fact is the empire is facing the same problem the Soviets faced in
the mid-70’s when Brezhnev’s health rapidly deteriorated. The party knew
he was not long for the world, but there was no clear plan to replace
him. When he died in 1982, the 70-year-old Andropov served for two years
then died. He was followed by the 73-year-old Chernenko who promptly
died. Gorbachev was next in line and he proved to be incapable of
maintaining the empire.

The reason the Soviets did not have a competent new generation of
leaders ready to supplant the Brezhnev crew is they had never been
developed. We see the same thing with the current generation in
Washington. The next generation does not exist as they have been boiled
off for fear they would be too ambitious. What is left is a collection
of dull-witted time servers and youthful morons like Sandy Cortez. No
wonder no one wants to see the geezers carried off the political stage.

Getting back to where we started, it is prudent to think about the
knock-on effects of the current generation of political leaders shedding
this mortal coil. The political system has been warped by their long
time in office and that will change as well. The old Soviet system had
evolved for men like Brezhnev and his henchmen. Our political system has
evolved for this long serving generation of politicians. When they are
gone, the system around them will change radically and perhaps
violently.
