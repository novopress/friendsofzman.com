**Note:** The regular Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/a-new-legal-theory/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is up at Taki. This week I take
a deep dive into the legal theory underlying the recent political
trials. Behind the
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">green door</a> I have several new items since last week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the Great Panic began almost two years ago, the question on the
minds of the curious has been how long will it last? Panics are not new
in human society and they are not new to recent times either. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">satanic panic</a> that started in the 1980’s never
really ended completely. The “face on a milk carton” meme is still with
us, despite the fact few people remember is started in a panic. That was
close to half a century ago, suggesting panics never really end.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing-children_milk_carton"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">missing kid panic</a> changed American
society. Prior to that time, it was not unusual for children to walk to
school with just the older kids supervising. Kids spent their
after-school time playing outside, usually unsupervised. In big cities,
kids would ride public transit to school. No one thought it was strange.
After the panic, supervised activities became the norm. Video games
found a target-rich environment of kids stuck inside by themselves or
within earshot of their parents.

That suggests the Covid panic has a long way to go and may never end.
That should be obvious at this point. First it was two weeks to bend the
curve so hospitals could avoid being overrun by flu patients. That gave
way to a regime of total fright with people required to wear amulets
reminding everyone of the great fear. The vaccine should have broken the
fear, but here we are facing new lockdowns due to the omicron strain,
which reportedly attacks the vaccinated for some reason.

The omicron variant is probably the most amusing twist in the great
Covid panic so far, because it suggests someone in the system has a
sense of humor. As many have pointed out, the word “omicron” is an
anagram for “moronic”. There is also the reference to a classic Star
Trek <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Side_of_Paradise_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">episode</a>. The spores on Omicron ceti
iii made people euphoric and gave them everlasting health in exchange
for a desire to never leave. The plants and the humans became two sides
of a blissful relationship.

Part of what is driving this is belief. Humans are believing machines
and with the collapse of traditional religion, people are falling into
cultural and political cults that scratch the same itch as the old gods.
Nature cults have been a staple of human existence since the beginning.
At a certain level, the people swept up in the cult of Covid feel they
are being punished for a sin against nature. Covid is nature’s vengeance
against mankind.

That is why good news is always bad news with Covid. The new <a
href="https://www.bedfordshirelive.co.uk/news/bedfordshire-news/new-symptomless-covid-strain-more-6234566"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">mysterious variant</a> that does not make
people sick is “symptomless Covid” rather than the natural weakening the
virus with each new mutation. The omicron variant is similarly a <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/omicron-extremely-mild-says-doctor-who-first-discovered-strain-numerous-mutations"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">weaker mutation</a>, but it is setting
off panic around the world. Covid is a proxy for a new mystery god, one
that reveals itself only through it actions. Like all gods, it is
eternal, so its manifestations will be eternal as well. Covid is here
forever.

The main driver of the panic from the beginning has been the ruling
class, which is looking like Howard Hughes <a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnOKOUjXcAUwo9L?format=jpg&amp;name=large"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">at the end</a>. Instead of shutting
themselves up in their mansions and wearing tissue boxes on their feet,
they are <a href="https://archive.md/kC4AI" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">obsessed</a> with conquering death itself. The actors
they hire to perform the rituals off democracy are not quite as bad, but
they are a gerontocracy now. As such, they startle at the slightest
touch, assuming it must be the Grim Reaper.

There is also the weird
<a href="https://eugyppius.substack.com/p/ignorant-and-afraid"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">isolation</a> of the managerial class. It
is not a physical isolation as they do leave their compounds to explore
the land of the Dirt People. It is a psychological and cultural
isolation. They can imagine hospitals overflowing and people dying in
the streets, even though they see no evidence of these things, because
they are conditioned by their existence to trust their coevals over
their own eyes. If they see it in their media, it is true, no matter
what reality has to say.

This combination of old and isolated has created a ruling class that is
deeply paranoid about what happens outside the safety of their safe
zones. Note how often the word “safe” comes up in their rhetoric. They
see themselves as the protectors of society, so they are constantly
going on about safety. The reason for that is they assume everyone
shares their fear and paranoia about the world. Covid is powerful juju
for a ruling class hiding from nature, reality and their own mortality.

Of course, a big part of the panic is the opportunity for the deranged
to inflict themselves on the rest of us. Covid has been manna from
heaven for the sort of person who sees herself as everyone’s den mother.
These people will never get enough of the state of emergency, which
provides the panic stricken elite with an amen chorus giving them the
allusion of consent. One side pleads to be made safe while the other
side pleads to be the savior of mankind.

This brings us back to the original question. When does this panic end?
Most likely, it will require a generational turnover. The gerontocracy
will die off and be replaced by something worse, but something younger.
That means these health panics are probably a feature of the empire now.
Like superhero movies, Covid will be rebooted and reimagined every few
years. If you want a picture of the future, imagine an ornamental mask
on a human face— forever.
