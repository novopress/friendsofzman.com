**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about the demographic
collapse playing out in the workforce, a post about how the Tenet Media
case looks like a political op and the Sunday podcast. Subscribe

Would Jesus hate the cat memes that have spread across the internet in
response to the Haitian problem in Springfield Ohio? Some people think
so. Progressive
<a href="https://x.com/chrislhayes/status/1834377065803513954"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">cranks</a> have responded to this by
claiming it is your Christian duty to welcome these people into your
homes. Granted, these people are not sincere but people who claim to be
Christians of some sort often agree with them. They claim Scripture
requires the faithful to treat everyone equally, as God’s children.

This is the official position of the Catholic Church. The Pope is a big
fan of open borders and mass immigration. It is not just for theological
reasons. One argument is that the migrants from the global south are
Catholics or could become Catholic. Protestant churches make similar
claims. Immigration is seen by main stream churches as a solution to
their empty pews. Some claim that the Haitian migrants have <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/springfield-ohio-haitian-immigrants-sunday-church-aa7827f1236f207c9f64ae07096e3977"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">revitalized</a> the churches in the
Springfield Ohio area.

Of course, the people making these claims can find in Scripture what
they need to support their position as the morally correct one.
Ephesians says, “you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow
citizens with God’s people.” Leviticus says, “You shall treat the
stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall
love him as yourself”. Hebrews says you must show hospitality to
strangers and modern Hebrews say you should never notice this.

The most popular and probably the most effective argument from faith
used in favor of open borders is that all men are created in God’s
image. Since we are all God’s children, we have the same duty to
cat-eating Haitians as we do to the Irish guy who drives the UPS truck
and helps coach the local football team. Since immigration is an issue
because it is the movement of nonwhites into white areas, it is a racial
issue, and the Christian is prohibited from seeing race.

The obvious counter to this is that Jesus was fine with slavery, so he
surely would not oppose the deportation of illegal aliens. This never
registers with the Bible-quoting immigration enthusiast because much of
what makes up modern Christianity in the West is cherry picking verses
from Scripture that just so happen to support the secular morality of
this age. For the most part, what passes for Christianity in the West is
just a loyal servant at the foot of neo-liberalism.

That still leaves the question as to whether Jesus would be on the side
of the people important pet-eating Haitians into your town or on the
side of the people making AI-generated memes of Trump defending the
house cats. The logic of Christianity says that Jesus would be pumping
out those cat memes. He would not be making overtly racial claims about
Haitians, most likely, but what we understand about Christian faith
tells us he would be opposed to mass migration.

The place to start is where Christianity starts. The “open borders
Christians” are correct when they say these Haitians are God’s children,
no different from the fifth-generation Irish guy or the guy who traces
his line to the Mayflower. Fundamental to the Christian faith is that we
are God’s creation and humans are made in God’s image. Our ability to
understand God at all rests on the assumption that he possesses all the
qualities we possess as human beings.

From this we can draw one obvious conclusion. We have reason and free
will, thus God intended for us to use our reason and free will. God does
not make mistakes, at least this is true for the New Testament God. The
God of the Hebrew Bible is not as confident, so maybe he was still prone
to error. Regardless, God gave us, and only us, free will and reason, so
it must have been on purpose and for a reason. The only possible reason
is to use them.

The other thing that we know, if we are all God’s creation, is that all
men are God’s property for the same reason man can have property. God
owns himself, so God owns that which he has created. He gave man
dominion over the earth and all of the living creatures on it, but he
did not grant ownership. God may be an absentee landlord, as many have
asserted, but he is still the landlord, which means he still owns what
he created, including mankind.

This is the basis of Christian ethics. What we ought and ought not do is
based on the idea that we are all God’s property. Theft is wrong because
when you steal the labor of another man, you are harming God’s property.
On the other hand, punishing someone for theft, is acting on God’s
behalf to right the wrong done to God. It is why we think hunting for
food is perfectly acceptable. Man needs to eat, and God gave us domain
over the animals. Hunting for sport, however, is complicated.

The logic of Christianity tells us that Jesus would be appalled by what
is happening in towns like Springfield Ohio. Rounding up Haitians and
dumping them into unsuspecting towns around North America does nothing
to reduce the damage done to God’s most precious property, mankind. In
fact, it increases the damage. Worse yet, this damage is done for the
benefit of the money changers responsible for it. What we see happening
with immigration is a deliberate offense to the Christian God.

This is even more obvious when we remember that we have reason and free
for the sole purpose of using it. If we wanted to help Haiti, there are
ways we could improve the conditions on the island without harming cat
owners in Ohio. We could take over the island, set up a local dictator
tasked with distributing food and medicine. We could round up the
Haitians and send them to Africa, where they have the minimum
infrastructure needed to maintain an African population.

The point of all this is that Christian ethics is about reducing the
damage to God’s property, which is primarily mankind, but also that
which mankind has been granted dominion, the earth, and its inhabitants.
Mankind has reason and free will in order to figure out the best way to
act in order to minimize the damage to God’s property, so we are free to
debate the issue. We must be free to debate the issue. Cherry picking
lines from Scripture to shut down debate is therefore immoral.

More important, cherry-picking lines from Scripture so that you can
claim a sense of compliance with the will of God, at the expense of
God’s property, as in the damage done by immigration, violates the
foundational logic of Christianity. If Jesus were here today, he would
not only flip over the tables in the offices of the people responsible
for unchecked immigration, but he would also whip the people waving
around their Bibles in support of it. Jesus would hate them.
