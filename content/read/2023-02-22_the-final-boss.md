Since the concept of the “red pill” got going, there has been a debate
about the progression one takes in the awakening. Logically, this
implies that there is a final boss on this journey, some belief one must
drop in order to finally become fully aware of what is happening behind
the façade of life. Once you defeat that final boss, you see things as
they are, not as they are presented. Of course, the nature of this final
boss almost always reflects personal bias.

Strangely, the real final boss in this process may be the crux of the
whole normie belief structure that gets ridiculed by dissidents. That
last belief may simply be that the political class cares about public
opinion. Even the most cynical among us still thinks that the people in
charge worry about public opinion. They may have ways to fortify
democracy against the voters, but they still worry about the voters.
After all, no democracy can be completely fortified.

The reality is, they probably do not care at all. The people controlling
the politicians certainly do not care. The unanimity of opinion among
this group is why the two parties are barely distinguishable from one
another. What is the main different between Mitch McConnell and Chuck
Schumer? The people who animate the politicians have their aqendas and
they do not care about public opinion. Most people get that, but they
still think the pols care and they need to care.

The trouble is, there is no evidence of this. For example, it was rather
obvious that the Republican Party threw the 2018 midterm to spite Trump
and his voters. They could do this knowing that they would not suffer in
any meaningful way. Sure, some back benchers in the party would have to
transition into lobbying jobs or (gasp!) the dreaded private sector, but
90% of the caucus would do just fine. In fact, the bosses could expect
to be rewarded for throwing the fight.

The last midterm was a similar display of indifference. If the parties
really cared about the result, they would have pulled out all the stops.
On the Democrat side, it was a chance to prove those election deniers
were wrong. Joe Biden really was the most popular man in history. On the
other side, the Republicans could have got their red wave of rebuke.
Instead, both sides worked to make sure none of the populists got the
support they needed to beat a system candidate.

The indifference of the political class is most obvious with what is
going on in the town of East Palestine Ohio. There was a time not so
long ago when the place would have been crawling with Democratic
politicians, including the President. They would bring the media to show
how much they care about the people. Instead, Pete Buttigieg is
antiquing in Vermont and Biden is in Poland promising the people of
Ukraine that he will take care of them forever.

Of course, the media could cover it on their own. It is the ideal story,
ripped right from one of many movies over the years. We have a small
town being victimized by a mean and indifferent corporation. It is as if
someone decided to make a real life version of the movie Erin
Brockovich. Instead, the media cannot be bothered and the reason is the
political class does not care about it. More important, they do not care
that the people might think they do not care.

The fact is, the political system in America reached a point where
elections make no difference to the system. Over 95% of incumbents win
reelection and those who lose land in cushy jobs. John Boehner now makes
seven figures selling weed, after a disastrous run as Speaker. Paul Ryan
makes seven figures sitting around one of the banks, making calls to
Washington on behalf of the bankers. When the losers get rich the
winners do not fear losing.

In the bigger picture, even a wave election does little to change the
makeup of the political parties in Washington. If forty House seats
change hands in a wave election, it means close to 400 remain safe. Look
at the last twenty years and you see that maybe 60 Congressional
districts can be competitive. Most years only about twenty seats are
genuinely up for grabs. American Congressional elections are ceremonial.
It is a big expensive show that means nothing.

What appears to have happened over the last thirty years is the
political class has internalized this reality and they no longer care
about elections. The contempt we see is not so much about public
opinion, but about the lingering need to keep up appearances with
regards to elections and public opinion. The leaders of both parties are
increasingly irritated that they have to pretend to care about your
opinion. They have better things to do than take questions from the
slobs.

This reality is hard for Americans to accept. Central to the American
identity is the invincibility of the marketplace. The “go woke, go
broke” business reflects the enduring belief that public opinion
matters. The fact that none of the woke are going broke does nothing to
alter this belief. Something similar is in play with elections. Despite
all the evidence to the contrary, people still cling to the idea that
public opinion not only matters, but it matters to the politicians.

Even people on this side of the divide cling to this belief. The concept
of the psy-op rests on the idea that the people in charge care about
public opinion. In reality, the secret police just like their work. The
same can be said for the busy bodies that police the internet for bad
think. They are not shaping public opinion. They simply enjoy playing
hall monitor. Contempt for the public and public opinion is now the coin
of the realm in the ruling class.

That is the final boss. You can be red pilled about race, ethnicity,
history or conservatism, but still believe public opinion matters. You
only become fully aware when you defeat that final boss and realize that
the people in charge are indifferent to public opinion and often
contemptuous of it. The reason elections change nothing is the entirety
of the political class is in agreement on most everything. Mainly, they
agree that they are in charge and your opinion does not matter.
