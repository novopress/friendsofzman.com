Predictions for the new year are a tradition in the content creation
world, but it seems like the tradition is fading. The obvious reason is
the zombies in the mass media are no longer capable of independent
thought. If your job is to repeat what you are told, making predictions
is a very dangerous game. That and you run the risk of accidentally
noticing something that is forbidden. Predictions are about trends and
noticing those is a high crime these days, so predictions are frowned
upon.

The other reason this tradition is fading is America is no longer an
optimistic society, so making predictions is a bit grim. Predicting that
Americans will reach Mars in the next decade is fun and exciting.
Predicting that the economy will continue to crumble due to mass piracy
by the ruling class is depressing. Even for those on this side of the
divide, looking into the abyss is not a lot of fun. That said, it is a
tradition and traditions must be maintained even in the worst of times.

With that in mind, let us get right into it. The economy in Europe will
continue to crumble in 2023, with energy concerns reaching critical
mass. They stocked up on Russian gas to make it through this winter, but
that stock is gone and the replacement will be significantly more
expensive going forward. The goofy oil price cap will begin to warp the
market, driving prices up in Europe, but down in Asia. This will
accelerate the de-industrialization of Europe creating an economic panic
by the autumn.

In the U.S., inflation will remain stubbornly high, especially as
de-dollarization of the energy markets picks up steam. The Fed will have
no choice but to shift from the Arthur Burns strategy to the Paul Volker
strategy. Higher energy costs and China’s aggressive currency policies
will force the Fed to remove dollars from the system in a far more
aggressive fashion than in 2022. Mortgage rates will break the nine
percent barrier in the fall as the economy dips into recession…

Cozy TV gets de-platformed from the internet…

On the political front, the prosecutor assigned to investigate Trump
hits him with some spurious charges, in order to keep Trump viable. The
regime thinks he is their best bet at avoiding a change in figure head.
The charges will lack seriousness, thus turning Trump into a martyr for
the base. Meanwhile, the Republican leadership rallies around Tim Scott
as their anti-Trump option. They think their voters will abandon Trump
if the option is a magical black man.

As the economy gets worse, the rumblings about a primary challenge to
Biden will grow louder, especially as things in Ukraine fall apart. All
of the pundits will swear that Biden will choose to step aside, but
instead he will announce that he intends to run for another term, even
though he has no idea where he is most of the time. At this point, even
the dumbest Democratic voter will start to realize that our elections
are just theater and they have no bearing on public policy…

Kanye West files for bankruptcy…

The crypto market will continue to erode as it becomes clear that the
novelty has passed and there will not be another rally. The fact is the
only use of crypto is to get around government policy. It is simply a
way to make real money disappear and then reappear somewhere else
without the government knowing about it. Bitcoin will drop below $10,000
by the summer and there will be talk about the entire space returning to
its roots as a tool of the underground economy…

I will finish my book…

By the late spring, it becomes clear that the Ukrainian army cannot
continue and the West has run out of weapons for them. This will force
the Ukrainian army to withdraw from the Donbass. Simultaneously, NATO
sends “advisers” into Western Ukraine, under the pretext of stemming the
flow of refugees into the rest of Europe. These “advisors” will be
mostly Polish military. By autumn, the Poles will be talking about
annexing Ukrainian lands that were once part of Poland.

This triggers a crisis in Europe as it will open a long suppressed
discussion about the borders drawn after WW2. The Germans will start
talking about lands they lost to Poland after the war. The Hungarians
will make their own claims in Ukraine. Romania will make is claims on
Moldova/Transnistria. Meanwhile, the Balkans will get hot as all of the
old claims come to a boil. Meanwhile, the Russians will turn their newly
acquired territories into a heavily fortified buffer between West and
East.

All of this calls into question the trillions spent on the Military
Industrial Complex over the last thirty years. People start to notice
that the weapons industry has been charging billions for machines that
are largely useless against an opponent that can fight back and
impossible to produce in the volumes required of a real conflict. The
failure in Ukraine will expose the fact that the American military
machine is just another grift in a society based on the greater fool
theory…

Musk turns Twitter back over to the censors and moves onto some new
hobby…

Joe Biden gives a speech in favor of human sacrifice. This sounds
ridiculous, but the coordinated effort by the managerial elite in favor
of the mutilation of children is one small step from ritual human
sacrifice. Canada is telling people to kill themselves, so that will be
in America soon. Put the two together and you can see how turning
euthanasia into a new right is the logical end. Given how the ruling
class sacralizes their fetishes, logic says they will be promoting human
sacrifice soon…

The Alex Jones case runs into an “enterprising” judge who will craft a
novel way around the legal protections Jones plans to use to guard his
assets. The judge will find a way for the plaintiffs to do a Tom Metzger
on Jones, stripping him of all of his assets and the commercial rights
to his own name. The Alex Jones show will become the property of the
skeevy weirdos suing him. Jones will be made penniless and no one in the
mainstream media will question it.

Meanwhile Sam Bankman-Fried will get time served and a small fine for
his role in the FTX scheme. This may sound crazy, but our legal system
is this corrupt. He and the rest of the perverts that ran the operation
will be given a free pass, as long as they keep their mouths shut about
who they bribed and for what purpose. Unlike Bernie Madoff, who robbed
important people, Bankman mostly robbed Dirt People, so the important
people will give him and his friends a pass…

The Oracle of Lagos will become the Oracle of Appalachia…

Happy New Year!
