One of the features of this age is the proliferation of lying to the
point where it is reasonable to assume everything is a lie. The West is
a liar’s culture now, where only the naivest trust anyone or anything.
This liar’s culture is led by the people at the top, who seem to take
great pleasure in lying for its own sake. They often lie when the truth
would serve them best. As a result of the endless downpour of lies from
the top of society, the culture itself is drenched in lying.

At the top, the culture of lying is obvious. We just went through a
month where the media and the so-called experts told us that a
day-drinking simpleton went from the butt of jokes to heroic strong
diverse female character. Of course, the fact that the concept of the
strong diverse female character exists is a testament to the promiscuous
lying that now defines the entertainment industry. Every ad on
television now contains a naked lie, placed there like some sort of
cultural totem.

This is filtering down to the rest of the culture. Online, social media
is now full of fakers called “influencers” who create an image for
themselves that is based on the lie that they are influencing how people
view the world. The internet influencer has taken the line from the
prior age, “fake it until you make”, and created a lifestyle around it
in order to convince the world that they are something they are not.
With many of them, it is clear that the lying is the primary appeal.

Of course, deceptive marketing has always been a part of retail
economics, but now it is the default assumption. The key to marketing is
to create a clever lie that does not necessarily fool people but stands
out amongst the other lies. The ability to craft a clever narrative
around a product or find a unique way to trick people into thinking they
need the thing is a point of pride now. It has reached the point where
it is expected, so that an honest appeal feels inauthentic.

You see the normalization of skullduggery in this <a
href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/facebook-partner-phones-listening-microphone"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about how Facebook pitches
itself to advertisers on its platform. The pitchmen laugh and boast
about spying on users via the mic on their mobile device to target ads
to them. There is no hint of shame at this sort of behavior, as it is
both expected and the standard. We now live in a time when not cheating
raises suspicions. If Facebook were not spying on its users, violating
their privacy, everyone would think it is odd.

The sacralization of lying is not without precedent. The Athenians were
famous for their lying and cheating. The Persian king Cyrus the Great
famously observed that the Greeks made a habit of cheating one another
through deception. Not only were they famous for their lying at the
time, but much of what we know about the Greek world comes to us from
notorious fabulists. Greek philosophy is the result of this culture that
prized lying above all other virtues.

The reason the Greeks were such promiscuous liars is their culture
relied upon persuasion to establish hierarchy and public policy. If an
Athenian male were particularly clever at winning arguments and
persuading the crowd, he would rise in status, which is why young males
from prominent families were drilled in rhetoric. In Athens, you could
rise to high status simply by being an unusually good liar. The Greek
hero Odysseus was a hero because he was a fantastic liar.

This is the fruit of the democratic spirit. In a world where the
standard is public opinion, winning public opinion is what matters most.
In fact, it must count for more than the truth, as the public often
accepts as true things that turn out to be false. If the goal is to win
the crowd, then playing to their deeply held misconceptions is just as
good, if not better, than disabusing them of those misconceptions. You
are more likely to win the crowd through flattery than through
confrontation.

This is most obvious in the marketplace. The seller has one goal and
that is to get the maximum price for his product. The buyer has one goal
and that is to pay the lowest price for the things he needs. Since these
are the two things that define the relationship between buyer and
seller, both sides have an incentive lie. If the only thing that matters
is getting over on the other side, then the truth is not a restraint. As
Cyrus noted, it means that Greeks freely lied to their brothers in the
agora.

For the dimwitted, democracy in this sense is not the mechanics of
casting ballots but the spirit that animates the people. The resulting
morality that arises from a culture where persuasion is the standard
against which everything is measured is going to be a morality that is
intended to persuade the masses. The “good” is not rooted in factual
reality, but in the needs of powerful interests whose power relies on
winning the mob to their side to the point where it is a habit of mind.

It is how America has become the New Athens. Like the Athenians, we have
embraced the democratic spirit to the point where factual reality is
just one tool in the toolkit of persuasion that may or may not be used
by the successful. The modern sophist is untethered from the truth, both
spiritually and emotionally, because the only thing that matters is
tricking some portion of the public. The road to riches is to be a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv1Kz_cyYKY" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">clever liar</a>, who even lies about his sincerity.

The lesson of the Greeks, one the framers understood, was that a society
stripped free of truth seeking, even when blessed with great
philosophers, will eventually persuade itself into a calamity. For the
Athenians, it was the Peloponnesian War. For the New Athenians, it will
be something similar, but until then sophists will be busy monetizing
their predictions, because in the New Athens, the only thing that
matters is lying, even if it is lying about the dangers that lie ahead.
