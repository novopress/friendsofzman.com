I ride with a guy who just got out of the Marine Corp and he and I will
chit-chat on breaks. He’s twenty years my junior, but we hit it off for
some reason. He was looking for a way to stay fit and started picking my
brain on the topic. Anyway, one of the things that he said he does not
miss about the service is dealing with 20-somethings. So many of them
struggle with basic responsibility that it gets tiresome. They learn
eventually, but he says he just got tired of dealing with it.

Hearing someone in their early 30’s complain about young people always
makes me smile. I’ve never been the sort of complain about the young. I
hated hearing it when I was young so I don’t do it now that I’m a
geezer. Yet, hearing it from people, who could be my kids, makes me
laugh for some reason. That said, I can see where he is coming from on
the topic. It’s hard dealing with young people today, which is why I
avoid it.

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This came to mind reading this</a> with
my Metamucil.

*North Korea has sentenced an American student to 15 years’ hard labour
for crimes against the state after he tearfully admitted that he tried
to steal a propaganda banner from a hotel.*  
*Otto Warmbier was arrested as he attempted to leave the country in
January and later made a televised “confession” saying that he had taken
the sign to bring back a “trophy”.*  
*North Korean state news agency KCNA said the 21-year-old’s offence was
“pursuant to the US government’s hostile policy” and that he was
convicted under an article of the criminal code dealing with
subversion.*  
*The University of Virginia student who had visited the isolated state
as a tourist, had said during his confession that he had tried to steal
the banner for an acquaintance who wanted to hang it in her church.*

In my youth, visiting East Germany was the thing to do for Americans
looking for some adventure. You could also go to places like El Salvador
or Nicaragua if you were truly brave. Brits, I’m told, would light out
for China or the Balkans for some reason. I once knew a French guy who
spent some years in North Africa bumming around and smoking hash. In all
cases, you knew what you were getting into and you knew to avoid
trouble.

North Korea is run by people that could very well be insane. It’s hard
to know as it could be an act for the West, but sometimes things are as
they appear. Going there at all is an unnecessary risk. There’s
adventure and then there is wearing a meat suit into the lion’s den. The
line between risk taking and idiocy is not that thin. It takes a mighty
leap to go from one to the other and this young man managed it.

What makes it hard to have any sympathy for him is what got him pinched
by the NORKs. He stole a poster so he could be a big shot back home.
This is the kind of behavior people complain about when discussing young
people of this generation. It’s this weird sense of entitlement. The kid
wanted it to look cool to his coevals. That’s all that mattered. He
could not imagine how this would be seen by the guys with guns.

It’s a shame the NORKs lack anything resembling self-awareness. What
they should have done is offered the kid a deal. He could do 15 years in
prison or take a beating. Have a guy like
<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JDDjxa7RsKg/maxresdefault.jpg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oddjob</a> standing there cracking his
knuckles waiting for the go ahead. Put the thing on YouTube. If the kid
took his beating like a man then he would be a hero back home. If not,
then he goes home as a coward. But, the NORKs are not known for nuance.
