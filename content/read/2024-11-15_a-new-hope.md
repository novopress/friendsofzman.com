The first couple of weeks after an election, the winning side spends the
time imagining all the good things that will come. The euphoria fades as
political reality sets in with the roll out of nominations to the new
administration. We see this with Trump, as he announces who he plans to
nominate to certain posts. The good feelings are now giving way to
varying levels of concern.

The big area of concern is his foreign policy team which looks like the
amen corner of the Israel lobby. The only skeptic of foreign adventurism
is Tulsi Gabbard, who he will nominate for the director of national
intelligence. This should not come as a complete shock since Miriam
Adelson provided a third of his campaign budget. She is the widow of
Sheldon Adelson, who is buried in the Mount of Olives.

A reality of political life in America is that the Israel lobby wields
an enormous amount of power, going back to the Johnson administration.
Even Truman complained about these people, when they were in their
infancy. Since the Six Day War, Israel has played an outsized role in
American politics, which means being in good standing with the Israel
lobby has been essential to victory.

It is not all bad news. Trump has sidelined the neocons, which are not a
part of the Israel lobby, despite what some people claim. The neocons
have drafted on the Israel lobby at times, but as we saw in the Biden
administration, their agenda can fall afoul of the Israel lobby.
Prioritizing Ukraine over Israel is probably what spelled the end of the
Biden presidency and the defeat of Harris.

Trump also seems to be serious about swinging a wrecking ball through
the corrupt Department of Justice. Nominating Matt Gaetz, a guy with
good reason to seek some retribution, says bad times are coming for the
crooks. His pick for the top assistant and the solicitor general is also
a good sign. If fixing the Justice Department means more of the same in
Israel, that is not the worst trade.

That is the show this week. I am heading out for the weekend, so it
means everyone and his brother has demanded time from me this week. As a
result I had not time to prep a show, so I just did an out off the top
of my head on the trade-offs were are starting to see in Trump 2.0. That
is the thing to understand. It is all about trade-offs that can advance
the ball down the field.

**Edit:** I am told that Adelson did not come up with the full $100
million, but Tim Mellon, of the Mellon family, kicked in $170 million. I
checked this and I cannot verify the former claim or the latter claim,
but Mellon did give at least $100 million. This

Regardless, the Israel lobby played a major role in getting Trump
elected, so they get paid. That is politics.
