week I’m continuing the experiment. The segments are shorter and there
are more of them, but organized into logical groupings. I think I may
have struck on an idea that will work for me. Each week, I’ll do bits
around a few themes or topics. That makes it easier to select material
and keeps me from rambling on like a lunatic. I’m finding that there’s
so much in the news I can rant and rave about that I need to set limits.

I also did some tinkering with the sound quality. People told me I
needed to crank back the volume a little and trim the high parts of the
audio. In the process of learning how to do that, I found out that
cheaper gear and software, means it is much harder to do this
efficiently. It looks like another item to the learning curve will be
figuring out how to select the right equipment for the job. But, I only
have a whole $30 invested thus far.

This week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and an
image that stays put the whole time. I’ve also offered up on YouTube
segments from the show for those with a short attention span. I think I
like this method going forward. Next up will be loading up iTunes with
the podcast, but that’s a bit more involved. I want to use their API
rather than do it manually so I’ll be unriddling that this week, as time
permits.
