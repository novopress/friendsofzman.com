rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This post</a> over at Marginal
Revolution is getting a lot of attention. Steve Sailer is filling the
comments thread, which always brings out a lot of responses. The
discussion about Obama is following the usual path. Even his supporters
struggle to accept that he is a bright guy. That’s always been a strange
thing about Obama-mania. The concept of the “first black president”
overwhelmed any discussion of the man. His biggest fans know little
about him. other than his skin.

There’s something else which will make Obama an inscrutable curiosity
for generations to come. The man lacks the usual traits we associate
with leadership. There’s no evidence of physical courage. He is an
awkward klutz, who is timid and aloof. All of our post-war presidents
have been manly, for lack of a better word. He also lacks the risk
taking trait. Again, even his biggest fans describe him as excessively
cautious. He is also indecisive. This is something his fans loath about
him.

That may be why his critics say he is average. He’s smart enough to know
he is not smart enough so he waits until the smart people decide. Then
he jumps on their idea as if it is his own. That’s a possibility, but
being a genius has never been a desirable quality in leaders. Obama is
at least as smart as Bush or Clinton, which is to say smart enough. The
decisiveness of Bush and Clinton was more than enough to overcome
whatever intellectual challenges they faced.

Obama is our first alien president. Everyone in the ruling class is
alien to normal Americans, but Obama is alien to the aliens. By the time
a candidate is nominated, we know everything there is to know about him
from birth to that moment. With Obama, we’re still not sure about large
swaths of his life, including where he was born. He never tells stories
about his youth or about when he was starting out in life. No one shows
up on TV talking about their friendship with Obama.

It’s as if he exists conceptually, but not tangibly. That really is the
way to imagine Obama as a president. he is an avatar, a creation
projected on the screens of our common culture. When his time is up, the
projector will be turned off and he will go away and be forgotten.
That’s because he was never a person, but instead a guy who ticked the
boxes for a campaign operation. Nice guy who took direction well and
never tried to improvise. He read his script as written.
