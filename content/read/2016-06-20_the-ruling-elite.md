Sine the usual suspects began to control popular culture, the image of
the ruling class has been the WASP. The caricature was of a horse faced,
toothy guy named “Prescott” that liked to wear a tennis sweater draped
over his shoulders. Alternatively, it was the old guy sitting in a
leather chair at his club, reading the Financial Times while smoking a
pipe and drinking brandy. The point of these caricatures was to
highlight the ethnic and cultural divide between the people in charge
and the rest of us.

Like all stereotypes, the origins of this are rooted in fact. For a long
time, the ruling elite of America was WASP and somewhat inbred. A
relatively small number of ruling clans out of New England ran
government, finance and foreign affairs. The Brahmins were folks who
traced their roots to the founding. They went to the best schools, knew
the best people and accepted their duty as the caretakers of the nation.
They were of course, almost always Episcopalian.

This is no longer reality in America. It remained a popular stereotype
because it is comforting to people. The rulers are not there because
they are better. They were born into it or they had connections that
allowed them to gain access to power. The ethnics still carry on like
the world is run by guys named Pemberton. Jews, of course, love this
social construct and are endlessly reminding us that they were kept out
of golf courses by the WASP elite.

Despite the mythologizing, the fact is we no longer have a WASP ruling
class. The real ethnic nature of the ruling class in America is Jewish.
As I pointed out in my
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?page_id=4482" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Mokita post</a>, Jews are smart and we live in an age
when being smart counts for a lot. The stereotype of the Jewish banker
or Jewish lawyer is obviously true. The titans of global finance are all
Jewish guys. The US Supreme Court is 30% Jewish and Obama has a Jewish
guy warming in the bullpen to replace Scalia.

The argument has always been that Jews dominated banking because of
historic discrimination and that’s not entirely false. Catholic
prohibitions against usury allowed Jews to dominate the lending
business, but that does not explain why Hollywood has always been
dominated by Jews. It does not explain why 30% of the Fortune 1000 are
people of Jewish descent. Jews are one percent of the population, but
represent 47% of major American sports team owners.

Ownership of sports teams is a great metric because it requires more
than just money to own a team. You have to have connections in the
elite. These sports leagues are clubs and they don’t just let anyone
join. These are clubs for members of the American elite to show they are
at the top. It’s the ultimate trophy for the most connected. The fact
that close to half the people in sports ownership are Jewish is a
reflection of the new American ruling class. It’s guys named Herb, not
Prescott.

Despite this amazing dominance, Jews still act as if they are a put upon
minority, scrambling to make a go of it in the teeth of ethnic
hostility. The show *Mad Men*, from what I understand, is based on the
myth that the Jews were kept out of advertising until last week. The guy
that invented the ad business in America was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Lasker" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Jewish guy from Chicago back in the 1920’s</a>. Then
there is the whole golf club business that Steve Sailer writes about a
lot.

It’s a powerful bit of mythology that probably works as motivation for
young Jewish kids setting out in the world. Every ethnic group in
America, except Germans and the English, has a similar sort of
mythology. The Irish swear that their uncle Seamus was denied jobs
because he was Irish. Italians claim they have been forever slandered by
the whole Mafia thing. Poles work the Catholic angle. East Asians are
quick to remind everyone about Fu Manchu and coolies.

Someone has to be the ruling elite in every society and having Jews in
charge is probably not the worst choice. A ruling elite that nurses a
grudge against the society over which it rules, because of past
discrimination, sounds a lot like Syria where the Alawites angrily rule
over Sunni majority. America is a not Syria, so there will not be a
violent uprising against the ruler sect, but it does mean Jews will have
to stop whining and accept their role as the ruling elite.

It also means that Americans will have rework their idea of the
aristocrat. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Talmud is a best seller in South
Korea</a> because Koreans want to be successful so they are setting out
to emulate the most successful ethnic group. Eventually, Americans will
do the same thing. Instead of a striver changing his name to “Blake
Ashcroft” and claiming Mayflower ancestry, the ambitious will change
their name to Murray Goldblatt and claim Holocaust ancestry.

This is already happening at the fringes. Guys like John Podhoretz are
constantly demanding to see Bar Mitzvah photos because they believe
people are faking their Jewishness in order to gain access to the club.
Whether or not people are “trying to pass” is tough to tell. Podhoretz
is an evil little slug. He could just be trying to damage his betters in
the community. Still, it is not far-fetched. There used to be a time
when you had to prove you went to Choate before gaining access to the
elite.

On the other hand, Jewish fertility rates in American are around 1.9,
with the highest being among ultra-orthodox sects at 4.1. The Jews in
charge are not breeding and it only takes a generation or two of these
sorts of TFR’s before <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jews in America begin to look like the
Amish</a>. Then there is the inevitable out-breeding and falling away
from the faith that challenges all religious minorities. It is entirely
possible that Jews in America are at their peak and are about to
experience a slide into oblivion.
