The show this week is mostly about Ukraine, but I did have a few minutes
to mention the retirement of Pat Buchanan. In retrospect I should have
done the whole show on him, as he is turning out to be the central
figure of dissident politics. His valiant revolt against the Republican
Party and the conservative movement made it possible for there to be a
dissident movement.

Buchanan is an example of necessary failure. His campaigns against the
neocons did nothing to change the trajectory of the party or the
managerial elite, but that is what many needed to see in order to truly
understand the problem. Buchanan was an inflexion point for many of us
at the time. Talk to dissidents of my generation and most will point to
that time as when they started their journey.

Before 1992, all but a few paleos thought it was possible to work the
system as it was advertised in order to change public policy. After 1992
many started to understand why Sam Francis had been right back in the
1980’s when he said that it was impossible to maintain conservative
polices or politics within a democracy. You either acquiesce to
democracy or you are rejected by it. Buchanan was the test case.

The thing about Brother Pat is he was the right sort of martyr. Lots of
people get chewed up by the system, but they tend to use their failure
as a reason to throw a pity party for themselves. In small ways they
signal that they would be willing to compromise in order to be allowed
back into the party. Their ego and pride means more to them than the
role that is laid out for them as a martyr to the cause.

Buchanan never did that. He understood the role he was playing and he
played it as well as his talents permitted. You always got the sense
that he understood that he would never see the new dawn, but that he
knew that he may see the signs of it before his days were done. The Good
Lord saw fit to grant the man that one small favor in the form of the
Trump phenomenon.

Thank you Brother Pat
