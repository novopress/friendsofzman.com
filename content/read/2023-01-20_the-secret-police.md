Ten years ago, if you asked people if the government was involved in
manipulating public opinion or leaning on social media companies or
spying on presidential candidates, very few people would have agreed.
Those who did think this was the case were branded conspiracy theorists.
Today, most people just seem to accept that this is now the way things
are done in our democracy.

It is hard to know if this is really the case, but the lack of public
outrage over the stream of revelations about government pressure on
social media companies suggests people are not surprised by it. Maybe
most people are still processing it, as no one was raised to think they
lived in a police state. Possibly the lack of mainstream coverage lets
the public ignore what they would prefer not to face.

When you look back at the last time the public learned they were
secretly being manipulated and spied upon by the secret police, the
reaction of today feels like capitulation in comparison to how people
reacted fifty years ago. Back then, both parties and the media were
outraged at the abuses, even though many in both parties and the media
were parties to the corruption.

This new version of the Church Committee that the Republican House is
planning is sure to turn into a circus. The reason is the Democrats will
go out of their way to make it as ridiculous as possible. They will
appoint their craziest members to be on the committee investigating the
secret police. The media will be tasked with discrediting the whole
thing as an assault on our democracy!

Of course, we can now see that the original Church Committee was a show
to placate the public and did nothing to limit the secret police. When
you look at the programs that were revealed during that time, you see
that they never actually ended. They just became part of the standard
operating procedure. In fact, the secret police are far more invasive
and abusive now than at anytime in its existence.

Even so, it is a good comparison. Fifty years ago, the people in charge
felt it necessary to convince the public that they had reined in their
secret police. Today they think it is funny that the secret police are
manipulating the media, pressuring social media companies and harassing
citizens over their opinions. It either means they no longer think they
need to maintain the lie or they are unable to do it.

That last part cannot be discounted. Go back and look at the people
running the secret police in the middle of the last century and then
compare them to the cast of characters we see today. Those old guys look
like giants in comparison. Fifty years ago, a mentally unstable man like
John Brennan would not have been allowed on the property. Maybe the
current crew simply lacks the talent to maintain the façade.

Alternatively, maybe the lesson the secret police learned from the
Church Committee is that they need better control of the politicians.
The reason they are so brazen today is they know they have nothing to
fear from Congress. If they can raid the villa of a former president,
what can they do to a pesky congressman. Perhaps like the Praetorian
Guards, the secret police have assumed control of the system.
