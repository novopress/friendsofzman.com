Thanksgiving is considered the most American of holidays, as it is
nothing like the typical holiday celebrated in the West. It has rather
specific origins located in the founding of the country. Those origins
are complete nonsense, of course, but that’s often the case with
cultural traditions. Even so, since Lincoln imposed the holiday on the
conquered nations of America, Thanksgiving has been the quintessential
American holiday and probably most people’s favorite time of year.

The origins of the holiday may be nonsense and the reason we have it may
be less than noble, but a time to count your blessings is a good thing.
It is made more important in an age in which the ruling class is trying
hard to destroy the social capital that is an essential part of human
society. When everything is transactional and artificial, having a few
days in which you are supposed to think the exact opposite looks a lot
like leaving the back door of the Death Star open.

That may be especially true this year. According to current polling,
more than half of American adults think the recent election was rigged.
No one has asked, but there is a good bet that most of those people
think the mass media, Wall Street and Silicon Valley were in on the
caper. In other words, most adults right now have lost trust in the
controlling institutions of our society. A holiday in which we are
encouraged to think about what really matters could not come at a better
time.

Of course, this year has seen our rulers go mad with power and inflict
all sorts of indignities upon us. There are the absurd lock downs and
costume requirements related to the Covid panic. In the states where the
tyrants have arbitrarily banned the sale of alcohol and installed snitch
lines for people to rat out their neighbors for enjoying themselves,
this will be a special time of year. A few days to think about all of
this is just what the doctor ordered.

For those in areas where the Left’s street thugs have been running wild
for most of the year, something similar is at work. The point of
civilized society is to provide leisure time, when you can enjoy the
simple pleasures with those you love. That is a sharp contrast to what
the wreckers who bankroll the street mobs think. Over turkey tomorrow, a
lot of people are going to think about what those oligarchs are really
trying to take from us with their street thugs and gangsters.

Most important, of course, those engaged in the fight against the
gathering darkness will be fortified by a few days of good food, good
friends and time with family. While the forces of darkness are driven by
avatars of the promised land and envy at what they can never attain, the
dissident it driven by the thoughts of home, community and the daily
struggle to make those things possible. For the dissident right, this is
the best holiday of the year, even more so in the current crisis.

The challenge, of course, will be the spiteful mutants who will try to
wreck the good times with their politics. The wine aunt who wants to
gloat about the election, the unstable uncle who thinks Hitler is hiding
under his bed and the young person whose mind has been poisoned by the
system will all think this is their time to be the wrecker they imagine
themselves to be. Dissidents everywhere will have to find a way to deal
with these people, but this is the nature of the struggle.

Probably the most important thing to take away from this year, the thing
to contemplate over the next few days, is the fact that we are on the
cusp of a new age. Those promises from the ruling class puppets, like
the Pretender Biden, to “build back better” should not worry anyone, as
these people are parasites. They are wreckers, unwittingly clearing a
path for what comes next. Someone will build back better, but it comes
after the reckoning that awaits every radical wrecker.

It may feel like a small consolation, but Thanksgiving has always been
about looking forward, as much as looking back. You take the time to
count your blessings and enjoy what you have, family, friends, your
health and so on, but it is also about giving thanks for being in the
great struggle of life. Whether it is carving a new society out of the
wilderness or preserving the seeds of civilization in the great storms
of the present, Thanksgiving is mostly about the promise of better days.

That is the thing that should keep the dissident going. The rage the
other side has for what is good in life is rooted, to a great degree, in
their fear of tomorrow. They know they are “always exposed to sudden
unexpected destruction. As he that walks in slippery places is every
moment liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall
stand or fall the next.” [This is the source of their
rage](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/edwards_jonathan/Sermons/Sinners.cfm).
They know they stand upon the slippery stones of radicalism, while we
stand on the firm ground of truth.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone.
