One analysis of the Roman Empire says that it reached a point where the
cost of maintaining the empire exceeded the benefits of empire. The
investments required to maintain the complex social and political
structures to maintain the empire continued to rise while the benefits
slowly fell to zero. This is the general thesis presented by Joseph
Tainter in his book *The Collapse of Complex Societies*. Complex
solutions eventually reach a point of diminishing marginal returns.

We may be seeing a similar issue with the Global America Empire. On the
one hand, we have the massive amount of debt accumulation to maintain
the global military presence required to maintain the empire. The
official United States military budget exceeds the combined total of the
other great powers. No one really knows what the actual cost of the
military is, as so much of it is off budget. Of course, this allows many
of the rulers to get rich in the process.

On the other hand. Enormous amounts of time and energy are invested in
maintaining the rationale for the empire. Unlike the Roman empire, which
was ruled by a small number of men, democratic empire must continue to
provide energy to the spring of democracy, which is moral certainty.
Rome conquered because it could, while America conquers because it has a
moral duty. “Our democracy” requires an endless war against those who
resist being crushed by “our democracy.”

What this means is that in addition to the trillions spent on weapons
and armies, trillions are also spent on maintaining the moral framework.
This cost is not strictly a government expense, but the system requires
it, so corporations are as engaged in narrative maintenance as
government entities. Companies embrace degenerate social fads, like
crossdressing, because they support the system. They support the system
because it is the system that makes them possible.

The most obvious example is the media. Thirty years ago, much of what a
newspaper did, even the big broadsheets like the Washington Post and New
York Times, was report on the mundane affairs of the world. They
promoted left-wing causes on the editorial side, but the news side was
the boring stuff of the news. Today, the entirety of the mass media is
engaged in the support of narratives. These entities are staffed with
content creators and storytellers.

Here is an <a href="https://archive.is/kI22S" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">example</a> in the Washington Post. Three people were
assigned the job of creating a story to explain the mass shooter
phenomenon. The plot here is that crazy white people are irrationally
paranoid about crime, so they are going shooty all of sudden, for no
reason at all! You see, crime is just fine. In fact, under the patient
rule of Dear Leader, crime is better now. The real problem is these
heavily armed white people and their racism.

Of course, the mass shooter phenomenon is a narrative created by the
same people now trying to explain it. The fact is, America is a big
country. That means there are lots of potential crackpots, compared to a
small country like Norway. When you look at the <a
href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/mass-shootings-by-country"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">numbers</a> on mass shootings, America is
doing better than most. Norway, on the other hand, seems to have a
problem. While “per capita” is a racist trope, it is the best way to
understand crime data.

Enormous amounts of time and money are directed by the regime into gun
grabbing and concealing the color of crime. The Mexican national who
went on a killing spree in Texas had his picture
<a href="https://twitter.com/DesiraeQoS/status/1653012367389650944"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">whitened</a> by the news media. This is a
thing that started with the “white Hispanic” George Zimmerman who did
the world a favor and killed Trayvon Martin ten years ago. Every media
company now has people whose sole job is to whitewash criminals this
way.

The color of crime is just one tiny area of the narrative support
system. The New York Times had a whole floor full of content creators
pushing various aspects of the Russian collusion hoax during the Trump
years. Thousands of people in the media are now used to push the Ukraine
story. Think about the cost in time and money that is required to <a
href="https://www.outkick.com/did-the-biden-administration-tell-an-la-times-reporter-what-question-to-ask/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">fake</a> a Joe Biden press conference.
The entire media complex is now employed in the creation and support of
narratives.

Again, the media has always been run by regime toadies, but thirty years
ago most of what they did was reporting. The bigshot columnists and
editors were allowed to put their thumb on the scale in terms of what
got promoted. The rest of the people produced mundane news accounts.
What we see today is an industrial bullshit machine that exists only to
crank out new narratives in support of the regime or new tales to
promote existing regime narratives.

This is just one small part of the narrative industrial complex. Tens of
thousands of people in government have been repurposed to the task.
Corporations have whole floors of people dedicated to the job of pushing
the latest thing. Hollywood is just another marketing arm of the regime.
Of course, the big tech platforms have dedicated themselves to
protecting and promoting regime narratives. More people engage in
censoring the internet now than in maintaining it.

The Twitter experience offers some insight into the cost of this. When
Musk took over, he fired waves of people. His rule was that if you wrote
code, you stayed, but if not then you were gone unless you could explain
yourself. He eventually fired eighty percent of the staff. The website
was unaffected. The reason is those fired people were employed to police
and promote the current narratives. They did nothing to keep the site
running or make the business profitable.

What all of this suggests is that the cost of maintaining the rationale
for the Global American Empire has reached the point of diminishing
returns. Just as the Roman empire’s investment in complex systems to
maintain itself reached the point of diminishing returns, the cost of
the imperial bullshit system has reached that point and maybe blown way
past it. The more they try to sell the latest narrative, the less likely
people are to accept the next narrative.
