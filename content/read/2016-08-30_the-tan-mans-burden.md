When I was a young man I had a job washing cars for a car rental place.
Mostly the job was two or three guys vacuuming up the inside, shooting
it with the deodorizer and then hosing it off. It was part-time work so
there was a gang of part-timers working in shifts. For a young honky in
the big city, it was an interesting experience because most of my
colleagues were from the third world. There were a few other honkies and
some American blacks, but most were immigrants from the third world.

One lesson I learned was that outside of America, the world is not black
and white. In the States, race was always about blacks and whites. In
the rest of the world, there are a lot of shades in between. There’s
also a fair bit of tribalism too. The African guys had a low opinion of
American blacks. One guy from Ghana used to tell me that only the stupid
were caught by slave traders and shipped to the new world. The smart
Africans stayed in Africa. West Indians also had a tough time with
American blacks. They put a great deal of effort into separating from
them.

The one guy I always remembered was a guy named Maurice, who was from
the Caribbean and of mixed race. He was obsessed with his mixed race
too. He never stopped talking about it. If he did not tell you he was
mixed race, you would have assumed he was Spanish or maybe Cajun. In
parts of the South like Louisiana you run into guys who are white, but
they have some Indian mixed in, or maybe even a black or two way back in
the family tree. They used to tick the white box, but now
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Butterfield"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they tick the black box</a>.

The thing about Maurice was he talked about his mixed race all the time
because he was a man without a race. The blacks did not accept him as
black and he just assumed the whites did not accept him as white. In all
likelihood, no one cared. I know I did not care, but he cared very much.
At the time, I just thought he was a guy with hangups, but looking back,
I see now that being a mulatto is a strange curse. While it has no real
social drawbacks in the modern age,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially for women,</a> for
whom it is an asset, the person of mixed race imagines it is a huge
burden.

It may be a burden too. This story about <a
href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rodney-harrison-on-colin-kaepernicks-anthem-protest-hes-not-black/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rodney Harrison calling out
Colin Kaepernick for not being authentically black</a> is a good
example. Until this controversy, my guess is exactly no one cared that
Kaepernick was half black, except Kaepernick, who appears to obsess over
it. So much so he went overboard trying to prove he belonged in the
black world, by affecting everything we would associate with black
culture. His wigger act really is over the top and most likely the
result of feeling like he has to be extra black in order to pass for
black. He is a tanned and tatted Vanilla Ice.

It has been noted that Obama’s closest advisers are mixed race people
who identify as black. Obama, of course, is of mixed race. He also has
the added burden of having been raised abroad. His connection to the
black American experience is theoretical, at best. Yet, he puts a lot of
effort into being not white and one could be forgiven for thinking that
maybe he nurses a grudge against whites. He did dedicate a book to his
delinquent father, but has never had much to say about his white mother
and white grandparents who raised him, other than a disparaging remark
about them.

Being black in America has its own unique challenges. Being white in
America is no guarantee of happiness either, but black people have some
special challenges that are made easier on an individual basis by black
solidarity. Talk to black professionals and one of the things they
lament is the lack of black middle class institutions. The cookout with
Ned Flanders is nice, but they want to be around other black people who
share their outlook. It’s why the black middle class has struggled to
cut off the black underclass. Racial solidarity is powerful stuff.

Mulatto man does not have anything like that as the mixed race people
are roughly 3% of the population. The black-white portion of that is
less than a third so the number of people with a black parent and white
parent is very small. There’s never been an identity group for mulattoes
so there’s no history or shared experience around which to build a
racial identity. The result, at least for now, is a class of people with
no tribe to call their own. They are not authentically black and they
don’t believe they are accepted as white. That disengagement probably
feels like a great burden to the person carrying it.
