Despite living in the age of universal deceit, people still tend to
believe that our political system works as advertised. This is most
obvious with Europeans who comment upon American politics. They can be
terribly jaded about how the world works, but still insist that Joe
Biden is the guy driving administration policy. They may even
acknowledge that he is a vegetable, but still insist he is the shot
caller.

We just went through an election and people are stunned to learn that no
one in Washington noticed it. It is business as usual in the imperial
capital. The only change is they will have to throw sand in the gears of
the Trump transition, but the purpose of which is to make sure it
remains business as usual after January. Exactly no one cares that the
people have spoken.

The main reason for this is elected office holders have little say in
how anything is done, not even in how legislation is passed. This is
done by an army of staffers, agency people, lobbyists and the
semi-permanent political class. The people in charge are the people you
rarely see on television or in the news. They are the people who make up
what Sam Francis called the leviathan.

That is the show this week. The stuff we learned in school about how our
political system functions has been reduced to nonsense. It sort of
worked that way decades ago, but the full flowering of the managerial
state has put the system in the control of the army of people who make
their living running the leviathan. Elections are just something they
now hold to distract us.
