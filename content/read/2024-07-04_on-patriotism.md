Most years the polling services and regime media outlets do polling on
patriotism to coincide with the July 4th holiday. This year is an
exception, probably because it is an election year, and the regime is at
war with itself. Given that the numbers <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/507980/extreme-pride-american-remains-near-record-low.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">last year</a> were dreadful, no one in
the regime was interested in the topic. This was a good decision, given
the intrigue swirling around Biden at the moment. No need to remind
people that no one else is happy with their country either.

One exception comes from the New York Post, which had one of the
<a href="https://www.maxraskin.com/interviews/rikki-schlott"

write a <a
href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/04/opinion/gen-z-is-horrendously-unpatriotic-its-on-all-of-us-to-fix-it/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about how her generation is not
patriotic because the schools failed them. Seeing this sort of
boomer-bait out in the wild is a bit weird if you no longer consume
regime media. That post reads like something from the Young Republicans
essay contest of 1995. There are few things more jarring than a young
person who sounds like an old person.

Objectively, it is easy to see why patriotism is in decline. Most people
define “patriotism” with the general happiness of the country. Right
now, even those who doing well in the material sense are cranky about
the country. Their leaders are buffoons, and the Dirt People continue to
not know their place. The Dirt People, of course, are unhappy with the
Cloud People for all the obvious reasons. You do not have to dig deep
into the issue to see why patriotism is at rock bottom.

Of course, below the surface of those youth numbers lies the demographic
reality that an empty vessel like Mx. Schlott is unable to notice. Most
young people are not white and not only have no connection to the
country’s past, but they have also been conditioned to hate that past as
part of their identity. Import enough barbarians, arm them with the
tools of cultural destruction and it is no surprise that they make war
on the past of the host people and their culture.

It is tempting to hate the barbarians flooding into the country, but the
fault lies with the rich people who run the country. The barbarians are
just rationally responding to what they are experiencing in the process.
They are invited in and encouraged to smash the place up, so from the
barbarian perspective, why should they have any respect for the place
they are encouraged to smash up? They are literally hired by the
overclass to destroy the very idea of America.

Putting that aside, the root cause here is democracy. It is not an
accident that the cultural and spiritual decline accelerated with the
dramatic increase in the use of the word “democracy” in public
discourse. Before this became a feature of our political Tourette’s
syndrome, reformers talked in terms of returning to a past ideal, rather
than pulling out a clean sheet of paper. Making war on the past was
never part of the agenda, even for the cranks on the left.

Starting with the end of the Cold War, this changed. Along with the rise
in the use of the word democracy, came the idea that what American needs
is a rewrite. Clinton ran on the claim that America was desperate for
radical change. This was despite the fact the country had gone through a
great economic boom. Obama was even more explicit in his desire to
fundamentally reorder the country, because in his view, everything was
wrong with the “words on the paper.”

The authority for this program to reinvent the country was democracy, by
which they meant the *real* will of the people. It might seem like
people were fat, dumb, and happy with consumerism, but the new democrats
knew better. What America wanted was radical change and that is what we
have gotten for close to three decades. It is what Biden promises,
despite having been in office for four years. Note the critique of Trump
is that he wants to take us back to the past.

This is the poison of democracy. In order to win office, you must win a
majority to your program, but to do that you must first get public
attention. No one gets attention with a program of keeping things the
same. Imagine a protest where the speaker calls, “What do we want?” and
the crowd responds with “More of the same!” and you can see why
democracy selects for change over stability. In fact, the only way
democracy can work is as a race to find the most radical path.

Then there is the nature of the people rewarded by democracy. You see it
in the interview with Mx. Schlott linked at the top. She has cultivated
a disdain for the present, but also an indifference to it. This is the
heart of the liberal who is sure she knows what needs to be fixed and
how to fix it but cannot be bothered doing the mundane tasks that make
society possible. Democracy loves the booshie snob with a head full of
impractical, but fashionable ideas.

It is important to note that the issue with democracy is not the
mechanics of measuring the general will on an issue. The problem lies
with the assumption that everyone has a purpose, so collectively society
has a purpose and therefore the point of democracy is to discover that
purpose and then reorder society in pursuit of the purpose, even if it
means trampling the laws. In a democracy, even the rules of democracy
are fair game when seeking to move society towards its spiritual end.

Of course, this is why patriotism is impossible in a democracy. To be
patriotic, one has to love his ancestors and their accomplishments so
much that he is willing to sacrifice to maintain those accomplishments.
This means the natural limits on men of the present is the accumulated
wisdom of the past. You cannot have a program of constant change and a
love of the past or even a healthy respect for your ancestors. Democracy
hates the past and anyone who thinks otherwise.

This is why patriotism is dead. It is not the demographic changes or the
material conditions that have killed our love of the past. It is the
institutional hatred of the past that has become the state religion. In
order to fully embrace democracy, one must not only break free of the
past, but turn and face it like an enemy. Despite all the pretensions
about the future, our lovers of democracy care little about what comes
next, only the next round of ancestor hatred.

This may seem like a grim view of the present, but it is only through
the clear lens of realism that an alternative can be formed.
Conservatism failed to hold onto anything in the face of this democratic
onslaught. That means what comes next must not be a defense of the past,
which has already slipped away from us, but a new offensive built around
a vision of a new future. What comes next will have to be built on the
bones of the democrats, not on what they have destroyed.
