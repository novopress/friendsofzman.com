good reminder that people will go to great lengths to avoid running
afoul of the official morality, enforced by the ruling class. Violating
the taboos of the commoners is never a problem, as long as the rulers
are OK with it. In post-modern America, a way to show your worth in the
ruling class is to violate the norms of decent people. To go the other
way is to risk being ruined, as the ruling class is as ruthless as
Muslims when it comes to enforcing their morality.

Baltimore has an interesting history. Up until the 20th century is was
basically a port city without much industry. When industry arrived, it
did so with a vengeance. Poles, Italians and Irish flooded in to work
the docks, steel mills and factories. They had an enormous car plant
near the docks that employed tens of thousands at its peak. In the
1950’s, Baltimore was one of the more important cities in the country.
It was economically importation and had one of the leading newspapers in
the nation.

The civil rights movement and its fallout in the 1960’s hit cities like
Baltimore particularly hard. Traditional neighborhoods were broken up in
something called block busting, as the usual suspects would buy a house
and move in a black family. Everyone would put their house up for sale
and the pirates would swoop in and buy at an increasingly discounted
price. Basically the landlords figured out how to monetize racism.
Baltimore went from roughly 75% white at the end of World War II to
majority black in a decade.

As black on white crime increased, the politics became tribal. The
remnant of the white population hung on for a while, but they were
playing a losing game. Crime control became racist and fell away. The
public schools fell prey to the racial spoils system and the collapse of
human capital. The middle-class, black and white, fled the city. There
was a respite for a while in the 2000’s, but like Detroit, Baltimore is
dying and headed for bankruptcy. If you want to see the future, visit
Charm City.

Maybe the Left can be forgiven for trying to address the issue of race
and the very real results of discrimination. In retrospect, their
solutions sound like the rantings of a crazy person, but at the time
they probably sounded plausible. After fifty years of failure, there’s
simply no excuse for race hustlers persisting in their views. Every
conceivable effort has been made to make integration work. Trillions
have been spent on a problem that is no better now than fifty years ago.
It’s time accept reality.
