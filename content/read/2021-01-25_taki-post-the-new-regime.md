If you were to round up a random collection of people and lock them up
in a school gymnasium, you would have a bunch of people locked in a

far enough away from land that they could not chance making a swim for
it. Maybe they do not even know where the island is in relation to a

will be rescued. They are there possibly forever. Unlike the people
