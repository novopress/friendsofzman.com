The show was recorded while the usual suspects were starting yet another
war in the Middle East, this time with Iran. At this point it is hard to
know where it leads, but we know Trump is powerless to do anything about
it. It is sadly clear over the last three administrations that no White
House runs foreign policy. The important decisions are made by people
outside the political system.

That is why war is on the list of things that could bring doom to
America. The people making these decisions are not thinking about what
is best for the United States or the American people. Therefore, the
United States and the American people could easily be sacrificed,
deliberately or accidentally, in service to the alien cause.
Civilization ending wars tend to be tragic accidents.

Even so, America is in no danger of being conquered militarily, so it is
hard to see war as the direct cause of our demise. War could trigger
other things, like a massive spike in oil prices that then set off a
financial collapse. If Iran decides it needs a regional war and blows up
Saudi oil facilities, then we could see an energy crisis. Unlike the
1970’s, an energy crisis today could trigger collapse.

That is the show for this Friday the 13th. I go through the possible end
times scenarios and rank them on a scale of one to ten. A bit of a
spoiler, but war is pretty far down the list of possible doomsday
scenarios. It could be a triggering event that eventually leads to one
of the other items on the list, but war itself is not a likely end for
us. The most likely cause of our doom is, well, you will just have to
listen.
