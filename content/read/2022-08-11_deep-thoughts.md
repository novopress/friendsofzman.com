In season four of the 1990’s television drama *The X-Files*, there is a
[scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyhAJEPEHk4) where one of the
villains is meeting with his subordinates. Staff members are asking
their boss how they should rig things like Hollywood award shows and
sports events. The boss says that he will not allow the Buffalo Bills to
win a Super Bowl and one of the staffers questions if that is possible.
Another staffer then explains how the boss was able to rig the 1980
Olympic hockey tournament.

The villain is a famous character from the show called Cancer Man or the
Smoking Man, because he is a chain smoker. No one seems to know his real
name. He just seems to be a guy who is at the heart of every conspiracy
and coverup, one step ahead of everyone, especially the protagonists. He
appears to work for the government, but he also represents the interests
of a shadowy group of old white men who may or may not control the
governments of the world.

That is what makes that scene memorable. To that point the show was a
little dodgy about the nature of the various conspiracies. Most of the
time the protagonists are racing to expose a coverup by the government.
At other times, it appears they are being manipulated by some shady
actors using their investigations as a way to coverup some more sinister
plot. In that scene we see that the deep state literally controls the
things we take for granted, like sporting events.

*The X-Files* franchise was a huge success because people like to think
that their world is controlled by someone. This is a feature of the
human condition. Early man thought the sprits that animated the natural
world altered the behavior of man. The ancients thought the gods
manipulated the affairs of man. Of course, Christianity starts with the
assumption that God created a rational world and he intervenes from time
to time to nudge man in a certain direction.

This is why the intelligent design concept is popular. For most people,
the idea of a chaotic, purposeless world is upsetting. Even though the
basics of intelligent design contradict the fundamentals of
Christianity, many Christians would rather believe God is endlessly
tinkering with his creation than accept evolution. Even though evolution
fits in with the concept of maker’s knowledge and the perfection of God,
people struggle with the seeming randomness of the natural world.

This also explains the appeal of the deep state. It is possible that the
raid on Trump’s villa was carried out by bit players exploiting an
opportunity. A regional FBI officer saw a chance to make a name for
himself, got a nutty judge to sign off on the search warrant and now we
have a scandal. This is a very unsatisfying explanation for most people,
so they reach for the deep state as an answer. This raid is part of some
plot run by shady characters who will never let Buffalo win a title.

None of this is to suggest that there are no conspiracies. A central
feature of human nature is cooperation, which is another way of saying
that it is the nature of man to plot with other men. Politics is defined
by the plots hatched and executed by factions within the political
system. Court intrigue has been with us since the first man was named
the leader of his people. Often, these plots take on a life of their
own. The original plot gets away from the plotters and becomes a
scandal.

The Russian collusion hoax is a good example. We now know the idea was
hatched by Clinton operatives as a political dirty trick. They made up
some phony evidence showing Trump was in league with Putin. Then they
fed it to the media and the FBI in order to force it into the general
conversation. The paranoid bigots of the far-left then turned it into
something the JFK conspiracy. The grifter-right then turned that into a
moneymaking scheme blaming the deep state.

The Russian collusion hoax is a good entry point in understanding the
appeal of the deep state concept. Most of the people who hated Trump
could not tell you why they hated him so much. The deep state concept
filled that whole. Trump was in league with those dark forces that
manipulate the world. On the other hand, Trump supporters could rely on
the deep state to explain why the system attacked Trump. Both sides of
the Trump story could sense the Cancer Man in the room.

John Derbyshire famously said, “The ordinary modes of human thinking are
magical, religious, social, and personal. We want our wishes to come
true; we want the universe to care about us; we want the approval of
those around us; we want to get even with that s.o.b. who insulted us at
the last tribal council. For most people, wanting to know the cold truth
about the world is way, way down the list.” From that it should be easy
to see why the deep state is a popular villain.

Another reason people like the idea of secret actors controlling events
is that it is easier to hate a person than a process. Anyone who has
worked with big complex systems knows the frustration of not having
someone to blame. The people are all doing the right thing, both morally
and technically, yet the results are wrong. There is no one to blame but
the system and the system is the result of all of those correct and
well-intended actions by the people involved.

Blaming the system for American decline is too much for most people.
They were raised to worship the idea of America. Blaming the system for
why things are getting progressively worse is like burning the flag. It
is a lot easier to blame some corrupting forces that are manipulating
events. The same phenomenon set in with the Soviet Union after Stalin.
Blaming bad actors operating in the shadows of the party was safer than
questioning the system.

The deep state is why popular government is a terrible idea. In popular
government, in theory at least, policy reflects the popular will.
Therefore, bad results must be the fault of the people. How can this be
possible when most people never wanted the bad result? It must be
something else. Whether communism, socialism or liberal democracy, the
people can never blame themselves, so they will find someone to blame,
even if they have to invent him.

In personal rule, everyone knows who to blame. If gas prices go up, the
people go down to the ruler’s house and demand he lower gas prices.
There is no deep state in personal rule as there is no need for one. The
motivations behind public policy are real and easily assigned to the
people in charge. Popular government needs a deep state onto which the
sorrows of the people can be cast. Otherwise, they will figure out who
is responsible and abandon the system in favor of personal rule.

From a dissident perspective, the deep state concept is mostly useful as
it is a vehicle for normal people to the land of doubt. The millions of
Trump supporters who think their man is the victim of the deep state are
losing faith in the system. The reckless shenanigans of mostly midlevel
players make others wonder if there really is a secret cabal
manipulating things. The deep state may simply be a sign that the system
is in severe decline and nearing collapse.
