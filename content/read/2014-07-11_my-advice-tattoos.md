Here’s a tip for young people. If you are planning a life of crime, <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">avoid getting face tattoos</a>.
It makes it easy for the cops to find you.

*<span style="font-family: tahoma;">Richard Magnan sports many of them.
The one on his forehead announcing “F— the World” may just emerge as the
prosecution’s exhibit A in his upcoming trial. Perhaps the defense will
enter the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago White Sox insignias on his
face as evidence of a dangerous split-personality disorder. </span>*

*<span style="font-family: tahoma;">A judge ordered the illustrated man
held on $3 million bail on involuntary manslaughter charges on
Wednesday. Chicago cops arrested Magnan on Monday for killing a friend
over the holiday weekend. The rooter of the White Sox in the American
and the Cardinals in the National–Is it a crime to hedge your bets and
back a team in both leagues?–allegedly shot a fellow member of the 2-6
gang in the stomach in a Walgreens parking lot at the intersection of
West 63rd Street and South Austin Avenue. The convicted felon, who now
maintains it was a mistake (the shooting, not the righteous ink), fled
the scene. There’s no word yet on how any potential witnesses described
Magnan to the police. </span>*

Eyewitness accounts are often tough to support at trial. People make
mistakes and forget things. Even public defenders can get an ID tossed
in many cases. When the perp has a “Fuck the World” tattoo on his
forehead, it’s hard to claim he was misidentified. It’s one thing to
have the attitude, it is another to make it an easily recognizable image
of your identity to the world. of course, criminals are not the smartest
people in the world.
