It was a struggle this week. Sometimes, I have more material than I need
and other times the opposite is true. It may be the result of the
Kavanaugh circus. We are in a letdown period while the crazies rest up
for the election. It could be me. It has been a melancholy week, and the
weather has changed suddenly. It has been a very tropical summer here in
Lagos and then all sudden it changed to mid-autumn. Autumn is by far my
favorite season, but we usually get a transition period in September,
where we ease into it.

It is weird. It seems like suddenly it is getting dark early, and the
leaves are falling off the trees. We have skipped that wonderful time
when the leaves change, and you get the smell of autumn in the air. As I
said, I like autumn, it is my favorite season. I like winter too, so I
am cool with the short days and long nights. We somehow skipped the
normal transition, and it feels a little depressing for some reason.
Maybe I am just getting old.

By the time I was putting the show together, I got interested in the
Proud Boys saga and I did not have time to do as much on it as I would
have liked. Maybe next week. There is also the story of the Rise Above
persecution that deserves attention. This is the group the Feds are
harassing over Charlottesville. It really is an egregious case, but one
that should put to bed any notions that we live in a lawful republic. We
are not all that far away from the government snatching people from
their homes in the middle of the night.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I am now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
