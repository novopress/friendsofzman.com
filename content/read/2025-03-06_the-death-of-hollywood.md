The Academy Awards show was this week and outside of the bugmen on
YouTube, there was not much interest in the program. They claim it
drew 19.69 million viewers, but they also claim that it is a five-year
high, even though the number they claimed last year was slightly higher.
Like everything else about the entertainment business, television
ratings are mostly fake. There was a time when this award show was a big
deal, but now it is mostly fodder for critics and comedians.

There are a lot of reasons why people have stopped caring about the
awards shows, but one big reason is the product is dreadful. The
nominees for best picture were a who’s who of films no one watched. The
winner for best picture was a film called *Anora*, which appears to be a
low-budget Slavic version of *Pretty Woman*. One of the runners up was a
film called *The Brutalist*, which is about hideous architecture. It was
also a low-budget, low-interest film that went straight to home video.

According to the bugmen who follow this stuff, the winner was supposed
to be a film called *Emilia Pérez*, but the people who decide these
things changed their minds at the last minute because the transvestite
star had once held unapproved opinions about blacks and Muslims or
whatever. Apparently, there is a hierarchy of degeneracy that the
carnies are required to respect. It is Hollywood, so who knows if any of
it is true, but it gets to why these awards show are floundering.

The Oscars used to be a popular topic because people were curious about
how their opinions of the films stacked up with the insiders. Women
liked watching the stars parade on stage and do their act in a social
atmosphere. That only works when people watch the films and recognize
the so-called stars. A Spanish man dressed as a woman, who is totally
unfamiliar to Americans, lumbering on stage to get an award is not going
to be a big draw for an American audience.

The fact is, Hollywood no longer serves the American audience. You see
it in the
<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">box office</a> for this year. The top grossing film is
comic book movie that is popular with non-English speakers because it is
mostly special effects and stupid dialogue. Half its gross is from
overseas and you can be sure that a big chunk of the domestic box office
is from people who are on the lookout for Tom Homan. Remove the nonwhite
box office and Hollywood does out of business.

Of course, the dependence on foreign sales and non-English-speaking
domestic customers is driven by the general decline in quality. Who is
the biggest male lead in Hollywood these days? If you do not know, you
are not alone, but it is probably a homosexual or a nonwhite. The same
is true for female stars. The days of Hollywood stars being glamourous
and recognizable are gone. Instead, it is a freakshow of random carnies
picked from the diversity lottery.

Starting about ten years ago, Hollywood began to see a steady decline in
revenues in North America, for both movies and television. Every year
the gross declines, with some years seeing double digit declines. The
remedy is to make an increasingly offensive product, which drives down
the numbers further. Even easy things like remakes of classics turn into
fiascos. The live-action *Snow White* has been repeatedly delayed
because the diversity loons turned it into a punchline.

The funny thing about the collapse of Hollywood is that it is a good
proxy for what we have seen in society as a whole. Unlike the
government, colleges or the media, Hollywood needs to move product and
that means they have to provide a product that the audience wants to
buy. It is the ultimate test of the social fads pushed by the radicals
over the last ten years. The fact that it was a disaster in the market
should have been a clue to what was coming.

Things are about to get worse for the entrainment rackets. AI will soon
make writers obsolete as software will generate scripts. Given that we
know there are a finite number of plots and character types, and there
is data on how these combinations appeal to audiences, it is easy to see
what happens. Software will generate scripts that have the highest
probability of success that year. That means all the experts on what is
trending will be working at Home Depot.

Of course, the content itself will soon be generated by robots. You can
now generate believable audio conversations using hints and suggestions.
Businesses are already doing this for training and development. Video is
coming online next. This not only will replace the actors, but it will
lower the barrier to entry of filmmaking. Soon, teenagers will be making
feature films that they find interesting. Just as digital audio killed
music sales, AI will kill the Hollywood production studio.

To fill this out a bit, imagine you want to watch a film and you want
something like the old spy thrillers of the past. You talk to your
television about what you have in mind and it creates a feature film
using your suggestions. Maybe it first suggests content made by others
who had the same idea. Or maybe it recreates a James Bond film using
period correct actors, but with changes based on your inputs. This is
something that will soon be possible with AI.

What all this points to is that the woke lunacy that has raged for the
last decade may have been the last effort at ideological control of the
culture. The slow and steady erosion of the control mechanisms coincided
with the woke rage. Perhaps the blue haired rage head was a reaction to
the steady disaggregation of the culture that has been brought on by the
technological revolution. She was not the vanguard, but a desperate
rearguard action that has failed.
