Western elites are in a competition with one another to see who can be
the most creative in violating the old rules of the liberal order. Every
week seems to bring a new outrage from a Western government. The reason
it seems like they are looking to outrage rather than work from an
understood ideological foundation is that they do not fully understand
their new ideological foundation. It is an evolving paradigm, as they
used to say, to which they are forced to adapt.

A good example is this rather
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0817jd9dqo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">weird story</a> out of the UK. A company was taken to
court because they paid warehouse workers more than their retail
workers. The warehouse staff was predominantly male while the retail
staff was predominantly female, thus creating a situation in which men
are earning more than women. The company pointed out that this is normal
and there was no evidence that women were discriminated against in
hiring or evaluations. They lost the case anyway.

Something called an employment tribunal agreed that “the difference in
pay rates between the jobs was not down to direct discrimination,
including the conscious or subconscious influence of gender on pay
decisions, but was caused by efforts to reduce cost and enhance profit.
Even so, it ruled that the “business need was not sufficiently great as
to overcome the discriminatory effect of lower basic pay.” In other
words, it just looked bad so it must be bad.

This is like saying that a man was not directly or indirectly
responsible for the death of someone he did not like, but the man’s
death just looked bad, so the fellow who did not like him will be
convicted of murder. In the new normal, you can be guilty of violating a
rule or law, even if you did not actually violate the rule or law,
simply because the rule or law is not getting the intended result. You
could literally end up in a British jail because the judge thinks it
looks bad for you to remain free.

For those familiar with American discrimination law, this may sound like
disparate impact, which is a legal term that refers to practices that
unintentionally discriminate against people of protected groups in areas
like employment and housing. This doctrine was imported to the UK for
the same insane reasons it exists in America. It is the only way around
objective reality while maintaining the radical delusions of universal
human equality and the blank slate.

The logic of disparate impact works like this. Since there are no
immutable differences between people or groups of people, any
differences between groups of people must be due to some form of
discrimination. Logically, there can be no other reason if universal
equality is true. Therefore, if there are group differences that
negatively impact nonwhites, then it must be from discrimination by
whites. Discrimination is the ghost in the machine that explains what we
see every day.

That is not what appears to be going on with this UK case. The tribunal
clearly stated that the company policy is neutral, as far as intent and
application. Apparently, there are female warehouse workers who make
what male warehouse workers make and male retail workers who make the
same as female retail workers. It is just that females prefer retail
while males prefer warehouse work. This bit of biological reality is so
disturbing to the court they ruled it must be eradicated.

It is a good example of two things we see with the new religion we see
with the managerial classes in the West. One is there is a strong whiff
of world rejecting Gnosticism about it. It is never clear if they are
trying to recreate the human condition to their liking or they simply
reject the human condition along with the objective reality in which
mankind resides. Perhaps Justice William O. Douglas’ use of the terms
“emanations” and “penumbras” was a clue.

The other thing you see is how the power of narrative warps their sense
of reality to the point where it is often at odds with reality. This is
something we keep seeing in things like the Ukraine war and now the
Harris campaign. The narrative provides an a model of reality that is
untethered from physical reality, so they must always be altering their
mental model of reality. Alternatively, they seek to force reality to
comply with the demands of their alternative reality.

It is not hard to imagine the judges in that UK case thinking, “We know
how things should be, so even though they are not that way, and we
cannot find evidence of Old Scratch in this, we will just set everything
right and all is good.” There is no thought of the secondary and
tertiary consequences to their ruling. If the company automates it
retail area to address the problems created by this ruling, they will be
back in court to explain why they are not living the court’s model of
reality.

All the loose talk about creating a new religion misses the fact that we
have a new religion, the religion of the managerial class. This new
religion has roots deep in the Western tradition. Not only does it
contain the egalitarianism and universalism of Christianity, but it also
has the mysticism from the ancients. At the heart is the suspicion that
reality is a figment of our imagination, so if we reimagine reality then
we can have a reality that frees us from the human condition.

In the end, this weird new religion is a luxury good. The parade of
lunacy we see is only possible because the masses have food and
entertainments. Each new bit of lunacy chips away at it but until it
reaches a critical state, the cost of these religious fantasies is
spread around the respective economy. The great enabler of managerial
lunacy is the ability to socialize the cost of it. At some point, the
cost becomes unbearable, and the new religion goes into the dustbin of
history with its adherents.
