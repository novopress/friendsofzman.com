It is that time of year again when I go into my winter hibernation. For
the next two weeks the show will be on hiatus for Christmas and New
Year’s. There will be regular written content here and behind the green
door, but it is time to give the old pipes a rest and prepare for the
new season of the show. This is the time of year when I plot new ideas
and changes to the format.

For the last show of the season, I decided to keep it light and do some
newsy stuff, but one thing I missed is the latest Twitter drama. I must
admit that even though I am not on Twitter, I am enjoying this more than
I should. For example, I see that Keith Olbermann was suspended by Musk
for being an all around horrible person. The new horrible person rule in
the terms of service is going to be great.

It also appears that Musk has banned doxing and mobbing. Antifa accounts
will no longer be allowed to post personal data about normal people.
They will also be banned if they try to get a mob together to attack a
normal person. This is pretty much the entirety of their activity on
Twitter. They are either doxing people or they are spying on people,
hoping to get them attacked in public.

The best part of this is that Musk banned some activists from the
mainstream sites like the Washington Post and CNN. All of the fruitcakes
who use the word “journalist” like it means “cleric” are up in arms.
“Just imagine if this had happened to a Fox News reporter” they gasp.
The fact that the old regime did this routinely has been forgotten,
because fanatics see only that which confirms their fanaticism.

Where this leads is hard to know. The crazies will never abandon the
site, but Musk seems to be determined to apply some basic rules evenly.
The Yoel Roth/child porn stuff seems to have rattled Musk. The day he
fired that perv was when things started changing quickly as far as
moderation. History says the sexual degeneracy stuff is always the
bridge too far in these matters.

What is happening with Twitter is a good reminder that one person with
power is better than a million people with no power. The reason to win
over the masses is so that people with real power decide to join the
cause. That can only happen when the masses appear to hold the moral
high ground. Musk was moved to act because people he liked were getting
the shaft from Twitter.
