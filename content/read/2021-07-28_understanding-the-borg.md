One of the more challenging things for dissidents to grasp about
politics within a liberal democracy is emergent behavior. This is
behavior of a group that does not depend on properties of individuals,
but on the relationships within the group. Right-wing people tend to
reject this in favor of reductionism. Individuals act out of material
self-interest, so the actions of a group must be out of self-interest.
This means the actions of all groups can be reduced down to individual
motivations.

The fact that this form of analysis has never been useful in combating
radicalism and irrationalism never seems to matter. There is something
about the mind of right-wing people that prevents them from questioning
this analysis. Perhaps it is simply the product of the rational mind.
People who seek to live orderly lives naturally assume order is the
default state of mind. To accept the existence of the hive mind is to
question a fundamental understanding of existence.

Regardless, emergent behavior is a real thing and accepting it is key to
understanding and predicting the behavior of the forces of darkness. The
best example is a flock of birds darting among trees at dusk. There is
no lead bird calling out commands to the rest of the birds. Instead,
every bird is both a leader and follower, responding to the actions of
the birds around it. When a bird on the edge of the group moves toward a
bit of food, the rest respond in a cascade of corresponding action.

Another useful way of thinking about it, at least within the context of
political behaviors within left-wing systems, is the synchronization of
metronomes. Everyone has probably seen the demonstration where they take
a group of metronomes operating at different rates and sit them
together. In short order they are swinging at the same rate. There is a
bit of
[math](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/classes/mth3380/syncpapers/metronome.pdf)
to it, but the
[demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aaxw4zbULMs) is enough
to make the point. While not emergent behavior, it is a good way to
visualize it.

We have a real world example of it this week at the Olympics. This was
supposed to be the Olympics where the glories of [black girl
magic](https://archive.is/pgGvW) broke through the toxic masculinity of
white supremacist culture. Instead, Naomi Osaka was bounced by a nobody
in the tennis competition. Then, Simone Biles led her team to a stunning
second place finish in the first phase of the gymnastics competition.
She topped it off by quitting on her team in the finals and they lost to
the Russians.

Inside the hive, this was not expected. They had prepped their stories
celebrating black girl magic and side pieces on diversity being the
strength of the team. The jock sniffers were in the pumpkin patch
waiting for the great pumpkin to arrive only to have reality turn up
instead. Faced with disconfirmation, they did not throw down the paper
straws from their soy lattes and question the power of black girl magic.
Instead, they frantically scanned their hive looking for support in
their belief.

Eventually, one of them came up with a way to fit this unexpected turn
of events into the narrative of black girl magic. You see, Biles was not
a petulant loser who quit on her team at the biggest moment. No, she is
a hero for selflessly omitting herself from the competition so the team
could carry on without her. Within minutes every sports reporter was
blinking this signal to the other members of the hive. By the end of the
day, this was the official narrative being told on every sports show.

The reductionist looks at this and assumes there must have been word
from central command that instructed everyone to get on board with the
new story. At the hollowed out volcano where the deep state operates,
they had a meeting, and this new narrative was created and quickly
e-mailed to all sports ninnies. It is an exaggeration, but that is how
many on the right assume the media operates. They believe it is
carefully choreographed performance operating along rational lines.

Instead, what is the norm, as in the case of the Olympics story, is
something similar to what Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley
Schachter observed in their study of the Seekers, a UFO cult in the
1950’s. Faced with the undeniable disconfirmatory evidence, individuals
look to the rest for support in maintaining the belief. If there is
strong enough social support, they find a way to rationalize the
disconfirmation within the general framework of their beliefs.

This is the natural behavior of radical groups. They have strong social
relationships within the group, because it is ultimately the point of
the group. The members join as a form of self-abnegation. They swap
their hated sense of self with the identity of the group, which is why
they are fiercely loyal to the group. It is also why they treat
criticism of the group as a physical attack. From their perspective, it
is an attack on their person, because their person is fully integrated
into the collective.

This is why left-wing groups are immune to reality. The fact-driven
right-winger can spend his life presenting his evidence and the radicals
will either ignore the disconfirmation or assimilate it into the
ideology, like a snake digests its meal. There is no shot caller at the
top directing it. The members are not conscious of it. Those silly
sports reporters covering for the Simone Biles are not even aware of
what they are doing, because they have lost all self-awareness.

This is why that left-wing person in your life acts different in
isolation than they do when within their hive. Their on-line behavior,
for example, is aggressive in defense of the hive, while in person they
are often quite meek. On-line, they have the sense of being in the
collective, so they act accordingly. In person, they are the soldier
isolated from his unit, thinking of nothing but getting home. It is also
why the radicals are the most intensely on-line. Social media has become
their virtual hive.
