For a while, it seemed like the human sciences might finally close the
gap between metaphysics and morality that has plagued us for so long.
The age of ideology has relied upon the blurry, unclear understanding of
human nature to get away with moral systems that are objectively
inhuman. If the sciences could clear up certain things about the human
condition, then it would force the ideologues to rethink their claims
about how humans ought to act and organize.

The ideologues had an answer to this and that was to declare much of the
human sciences haram. The crazies were sent out to proliferate the term
“race science” which simply means any science that contradicts the one
true faith. The human biodiversity guys never got their head around it
and as a result that scene has receded into the shadows of the internet.
The people in the professional sciences took the path blazed by
conservatives and bent the knee to the crazies.

Team science, in their shadowy warrens on the internet and secret
gatherings within the institutions, takes solace in the belief that
reality is that thing which does not go away when you stop believing in
it. Eventually, the reality of the human condition, as understood by
science, will prevail over the increasingly bizarre claims that we see
from the ideologues. After all, math must eventually prevail over the
people who think you are assigned a sex at birth.

That is most certainly true to a degree. The great snapback we are
seeing in public attitudes on a range of issues is due to the excesses
of the crazies. It is one thing for a man to put on a dress and parade
around town in it. It is another for that man to insist everyone play
make-believe with him. One of the truths about progressive values is
they prevail only where they comport with general Christian values. When
they collide with those values or physical reality, they crumble.

That is what we are seeing now. It was reasonable for the crazies to
demand that normal people tolerate the guy in the dress. Tolerance has
deep roots in Christian ethics to the point where it is a habit of mind
for Western people. The crazies could appeal to that deeply held belief
in favor of the pervert. When they demanded that the pervert in the
dress have easy access to your kids, then things changed. In the
fullness of time, it will be the lurch towards the kids that ended the
woke terror.

This is not much help to team science, which remains in a defensive
crouch, wondering if they will get a reprieve. The answer is probably
no, at least not until the egalitarian ideology is defeated by other
means. Intelligence studies, for example, are just about banned at this
point and will remain so. If you want to do that work, you will find no
funding and no support. The best you can do is bundle it up in another
area of research that passes muster with the academic clergy.

It is a good example of how facts have no chance against feelings. Facts
may not care about your feelings, but feelings are in charge. This has
always been so and that is a fact that the fact-people never grasp. You
get a sense of it in this
<a href="https://x.com/JayMan471/status/1924821533404344462"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">hilarious thread</a> by an old HBD guy on
Twitter. You get the sense that he is completely baffled as to why
people think he is the crazy one in the thread. Despite his “theory of
the mind” pretensions, he has no idea how people think.

Another example is this <a
href="https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/the-genetics-of-same-sex-sexual-orientation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by Steve Stewart-Williams on the
topic of homosexuality and its possible genetic causes. Since the dawn
of time, humans have understood that some men are sexually attracted to
men, rather than women. It was a problem to be managed, from a societal
perspective. This remains true. The causes of homosexuality are not
terribly important. Even if team science finally figures out the puzzle,
no one will care because it is not important.

What is important, regarding homosexuality, is how society deals with it
in the context of social health and fitness. Until recently, we had that
worked out, so if science does crack the puzzle, the most likely result
will be a eugenic solution to once again solve the homosexuality problem
from a societal perspective. Couples will demand tools to make sure
their child is not a homosexual. After all, no one has ever hoped their
child would grow up to be a happy, healthy homosexual.

The reason science has lost every fight with belief since Galileo is
that science is an unsatisfactory replacement for belief. Humans are
believing machines, so if you destroy their current beliefs, they do not
stop believing. They simply find something new to believe, often
something ridiculous, like communism. This is something team science has
never been able to grasp. Muttering “but it moves” does not help them
and it did not help Galileo either.

That is not to say that science is bunk. Some of it is, for sure. The
Covid revelations that are trickling out show how easily science is
corrupted. The reason the HBD world is a bit of laughingstock now is
they fell for the Covid nonsense. Science is a tool and like all of our
tools, it will be used to make our world as we think it ought to be, for
no other reason than we believe it should be so. If science is not the
right tool for the job, then we find different tools and maybe hang the
scientists.

As we enter the final phase of the last great ideology, it will not be
the death of belief and the rise of reason. Instead, it will be the
death of those old universal believes in favor of more practical and
useful beliefs. Science will be a tool in the struggle, but it will not
replace the dying ideology.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-pulhtgHHo" rel="noopener"

make of it, and “we” will be those who win the great struggle for who
rules. In the end, science tells us that it is always who shall overcome
whom.
