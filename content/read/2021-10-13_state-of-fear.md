There are many theories as to why the managerial class of America
enthusiastically embraces the nutty social fads. California now has a
law requiring “gender neutral” toy aisles in stores, for example. One
crazy putting this into a bill is understandable, but why did everyone
else go along with it? Why does anyone go along with the loopy idea of
gender at all? It is not a real thing. Humans are male and female.
Everyone has known this for thousands of years.

This is just one example, but the pattern is always the same. Certainly,
some do it out of fear of losing face. The oriental nature of the
managerial class is easily missed, but the whole face saving thing is
where you see it. That is not a normal quality of Northern European
people. It is what you see in a small, tightly knit people, but it is a
real thing in our managerial class. They fear being seen as outside the
current cultural norms of their class, so everyone plays along.

You can really tell this when you run into someone who is in the habit
of announcing her pronouns in her workplace. The low level people are
most prone to peer pressure, so they jump on these fads with as much
enthusiasm as they can muster. The trouble is she still interacts with
normal people. When she breaks out the pronouns around a normal, she has
the look you see with people struggling with <a
href="https://media.self.com/photos/615f203460cf8734424b494c/master/pass/1173433646"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">mental illness</a>. She is not sure if
what she is saying is what she is thinking.

This is how a minority within the managerial class is able to exert so
much power over the rest of the class. That California requirement on
toy aisles is no doubt the product of a lone crazy, but fear of
exclusion prevented everyone else from speaking out against an obviously
insane idea. No one wants to be the one who is seen rejecting the
morality of the whole. In a world where the most insane ideas get
embraced, who wants to risk opposing this nutty idea?

Even so, the managerial system selects for conformity, but it also
allows for the crazies who cook up these ideas. In other words, it
selects for a conformity that makes exception for anti-social behavior
and it selects for people who are always looking to undermine the
dominant culture. Put another way, the personality type most prized is
the sadistic subversive with a passion for enforcement. The most
perverted people are the most highly regarded in our ruling class.

Another angle to this, perhaps, is that the general belief system of the
managerial class is highly conformist. The reason is the people at the
top have no natural authority to legitimize their positions. The result
is a rigid culture that allows for very little creativity and
originality. The exception is when it comes to offending the normal
people of society, which is what separates the managerial class from
everyone else. You can be weird as long as it offends the normals.

The resulting culture is one that is extremely intolerant of deviation,
yet desperate for innovated ways to undermine tradition. The reason
these cultural fads are increasingly ridiculous is they are running out
of things to smash. When you have already put gay men in jock straps on
parade floats and made everyone remain silent about it, finding
something more offensively ridiculous is not easy. They jumped on drag
queen story hour out of desperation for something new.

The austere conformity is not seen by those who operate outside the
domains of the Cloud People, so the quiet desperation is not obvious.
Venture inside and what will be most striking is the humorlessness.
People smile and laugh a little, but there is an uncanny valley quality
to it. They laugh like people who read about how humans laugh from time
to time. Say something intended as a joke and they will look at one
another for permission to laugh at what the alien said.

The state of fear within the managerial class cannot be underestimated.
The ritualized sacrifice of that football coach over his heresy is not
intended for the Dirt People the NFL preys upon. That was for the Cloud
People. In a world where ritualized human sacrifice is accepted as
normal, fear of violating the rules, even by accident, is a very real
concern for these people. The threat of exile works the same as Stalin’s
gulag worked in the Soviet Union.

This is why no one in the media ever asks the obvious questions when the
various talking robots are put out for question and answer periods. A
group of normal people in the White House press room would cause the
face plate of Jen Psaki to fall off by coordinating their questions and
tangling her up in her lies. This never happens because normals are
never allowed inside. The people allowed inside know they can easily be
replaced by actors if they get out of line.

That was the point of the <a
href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/12/kamala-harris-slammed-for-using-child-actors-in-space-video/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kamala Harris video</a>. Not only did
they use child actors, but Harris also clearly performed like a
well-trained actress. To normal people it is just more evidence that
these people are sociopaths and liars. Inside the world of politics, it
is a message. There are plenty of unemployed actors willing to play
politician, reporter and so on, so make sure you know your lines before
filming. Democracy is just the theater portion of the managerial system
that rules America.

A ruling class rooted in fear of deviation but permitted to undermine
that which makes their existence possible is not one that can last. We
are seeing this with the growing economic crises. No one dares suggest
anything other than what is being done, so they are frozen in place,
hoping for a miracle. The Afghanistan debacle is another example of how
extreme conformity results in disaster. No one dared question the plan
or adjust it on the fly, so the plan just slammed into the rocks of
reality.

The is the crisis of today. The ossified geezer class at the top of the
system have insulated themselves against all possible reform. They rule
their system through fear and manufactured consent. The only relief for
the people in it is the orchestrated subversions like gender neutral toy
aisles. Like starving men fighting for crumbs, they jump at these
opportunities at something resembling life. Subversion is the bit of
sunlight that comes through their prison windows.
