The Saudis are an odious bunch, but they are the main power broker in
the Middle East, after the Israelis. As is often the case in foreign
affairs, you have to team up with terrible people sometimes to thwart
other terrible people. Saving the French from the Nazis was unpleasant,
but they were less odious than the Nazis. If it had been the Italians
who sacked Paris, maybe the choice is not so clear.

That’s the way it is with the Saudis. They will cause trouble, but a
different sort of trouble than other players in the region. The Bush
family took this too far and acted like sock puppets for the Saudi Royal
Family, but what Obama is doing is quite dumb. He really thinks he can
align with the Iranians and toss over the Saudis. This is so dumb
that <a

Iranians think he and his team are too dumb to pull off such an
alignment and the Saudis think he is too dumb to trust.

Diplomats are not going to say Obama is a moron and they want nothing to
do with him, but that’s what they are telling people. America may be a
clumsy, oafish giant, but it is still a giant that can wield incredible
economic and military pressure. The lesson the world learned from Iraq
is that American mistakes get Arabs killed by the tens of thousands, so
the Arab world is careful to not get on the wrong side the Americans.

It is one thing to have a bad policy. It is one thing to poorly execute
a policy. Mistakes happen and we get stuff wrong all the time. The
incompetence in the White House is a different issue. They have no
understanding of the world, but they think of themselves a worldly
statesman. The result is a feckless and unpredictable foreign policy.
The one thing diplomats fear most is unpredictability. Nations with
erratic leaders find themselves alone.

Of course, the larger issue is that Obama had a unique opportunity to
get the US out of the region entirely. He did pull troops from Iraq, but
that was just to spite the Bush people and the war party in Washington.
It was not part of a larger strategy to unwind the war machine he
inherited from Bush. It looks like he is committed to Afghanistan
forever, which makes less sense than keeping troops in Iraq. At least
Iraq has oil.
