For generations, there has been a debate outside of progressive circles
about the self-awareness of the people in progressives politics.
Conservatives have held onto the belief that the people spouting
progressive claims know that what they are saying is nonsense, but they
see advantage in supporting the current fads. This recent Paul Gottfried
<a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/28/strange-deep-state-bedfellows/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is a good example. He thinks the
FBI is simply making an alliance of convenience with the crazies.

Outside of conservative circles, there are those who think the people
telling us their pronouns really do think their genitals are imaginary.
It is not an act in order to gain some advantage, but a genuine belief.
They may not entirely understand what it is they claim to belief, but
they believe it, nonetheless. The woman claiming her small child is
another sex may be motivated by a desire for attention, but her
determination to mutilate her child is driven by belief.

We have a bit of a test case in the Brazil unrest. The crazies have
hated Bolsonaro since he first turned up on the scene. At first, they
hated him because he opposed the left-wing Lula da Silva. Now they hate
him because he was nice to Trump, which made him Hitler Junior. Now they
are <a href="https://archive.is/Pnyux" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">comparing</a> the recent riots to the patriotic protests
following the 2020 election. They seem to think this is proof that both
Trump and Bolsonaro are enemies of our democracy!

The thing is, Lula is clearly worse for the American regime than
Bolsonaro. A few minutes looking at his career makes that clear. When he
was in office, he was not very friendly toward America, preferring to
align with China and Russia. He now promises to push ahead with BRICS,
which has become a vehicle for Russia and China to counter the Global
American Empire. Brazil and Russia are about to ink an important trade
deal now that Lula is officially in office.

From the perspective of the American regime, Lula is a problem. Brazil
is a big and important country in the Western hemisphere. They have a
great deal of influence over the rest of South America. Having them move
from the American camp to the Russian camp should be viewed as a
catastrophe. It opens the door for both Russia and China to forge tries
with other countries in America’s backyard. Despite this, the media is
cheering the ascent of Lula over Bolsonaro.

Another good test case is the Russia collusion story. To normal people,
the claims from the Clinton people were obvious nonsense. Strip away the
heated rhetoric and what they were saying is that the Russians used some
form of mind control to cause people to vote for Trump. If that were
true, the Russians would have used this ability to convince the media
that Trump was a great guy. The whole thing was ridiculous, but the
media acted as if they believed every bit of it.

This <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1612601158782050307"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">exchange</a> between Matt Taibbi and
Glenn Greenwald is telling. Greenwald links to a study that claims the
Russians do not have a mind control device. To his credit, Greenwald has
made this point for years. Taibbi, on the other hand, chimes in with the
claim that the media simply got it wrong. This suggests there was a
reason to think that the Russians had the mind control device. In other
words, Taibbi thinks it is reasonable to think such a device exists.

Of course, the ongoing lunacy in Western media about the war in Ukraine
offers a great look into this topic. Every day we see stories in Western
media about how the Ukrainians are winning the war. Then there are the
stories about how Russia is ready to collapse at any minute. Are the
people writing these tall tales liars? Do they really believe what they
are writing? Are they just vessels being filled by lairs or true
believers in the content creation system?

Here is a <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ex-army-general-predicts-ukraine-liberates-crimea-by-end-of-august/ar-AA166tZb"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> quoting former General Ben
Hodges, who claims the Ukrainians will conquer Crimea by this summer.
Then they quote someone named Matthew Schmidt, who is the director of
international affairs at the University of New Haven. He claims that
Hodges is a bit optimistic, but with the right strategy, the Ukrainians
could maybe be in Moscow by Christmas. That is a bit of an exaggeration,
but his claims are so absurd that one has to wonder if he is taking
drugs.

Now, one can dismiss the guy working at a fifth tier state college as
nothing more than an attention seeker. The former general is another
matter. Ben Hodges was the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe.
He not only should understand the realities of war, but also be informed
about what is happening. For example, he would have to know that the
Ukrainian army is about to collapse in northern Donbas after a long and
foolish defense of the city of Bakhmut.

If the former general lying? Does he believe what he is saying? Has he
simply gone insane or taken up drug use? How about the people creating
the content? Can any of them use the internet and check to see if any of
these claims are true? A few minutes on-line would show them that
Sevastopol is a major Russian naval base. Without a navy, Ukraine has no
chance to take that port, thus making it impossible to conquer Crimea or
even make an assault on it.

Like the conspiracy theories about Trump or the Russians and their mind
control devices, the Ukraine war content in the media is easily
disproved nonsense, but none of it is ever questioned by the media. Is
this because they know it is all lies, but it serves the interests of
their masters or do they believe it? Why is there no one in these media
organizations asking basic questions? The unanimity in the media
strongly suggests they are a hive of true believers.

This may sound academic, but it is an important question. If these
people are simply craven liars, then they are open to reason. If on the
other hand, they are true believers, then they are beyond reason. The
former can be set straight and convinced that their interests lie in the
truth. The latter can never be convinced to accept reality. A society
run by true believers can only be reformed by first removing the
believers. That is not a facts and reason problem. That is a survival
problem.
