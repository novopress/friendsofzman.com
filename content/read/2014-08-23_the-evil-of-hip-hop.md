Apparently, listening to hip-hop causes <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">young Muslims men to go crazy
and start lopping of heads</a>.

*A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair
of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of
American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.*

*Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself
holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly
being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.”*

*Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial
on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.*

*Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once
charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former
gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s
Telegraph newspaper reported.*

*A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK
“within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail
reported.*

*Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists
they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of
his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”*

*Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has
a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according
to The Telegraph.*

Clearly, we must do something about this hip-hop music before all of our
fine young Muslim men run off to Syria.
