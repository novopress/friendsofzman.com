It is a double feature weekend! In addition to the normal podcast, I sat
down with the guys at [Myth of the 20th
Century](https://myth20c.wordpress.com/) to talk about modern finance,
American economics and ancient Athens. They are a good group and do some
very interesting stuff on their shows, so I hope everyone listens. I
think they will have the show posted later today or maybe tomorrow. I’ll
post a link here and all the other places I frequent. That means about
three hours of me this weekend.

This week’s show is a bit of an attic cleaning. Whenever I think of
something that could be useful in a show or post, I put it on the list.
Once I get enough of them, in theory, I’ll do a post on them or a
podcast on the general theme of the items. That’s the theory, but in
reality, I often ended up with a bunch of stray thoughts that don’t
really fit in with one another all that much. This week I took some of
those that were very loosely related to one another and did them as
segments.

The thought initially with these ideas was to do a long post or maybe a
podcast on how to deal with that crazy lefty in your life around the
holidays. All of us have at least one lunatic that we have to deal with
whether we like it or not. A guide to dealing with the lunatic in your
life seemed like a fun idea. Maybe I’ll do it one day, but for now I
just wanted to clean up the list and so this week I have a show about
the rhetoric we confront when dealing with lefty and his proxies.

**Technical Note:** The site was down for a good while overnight. It
seems that traffic is going up faster than capacity. Last spring, I had
to upgrade the server and bandwidth to match the demand, but demand
keeps going up. That’s a good thing, but it means another upgrade is on
the horizon. For now, there may be some outages from time to time until
I get that sorted. I hope to fold this in with the planned site upgrade
later this year, so I’m hoping to make the current setup work for now.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

discount to readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one

bucks, rather than have that latte at Starbucks. Thank you for your
support!
