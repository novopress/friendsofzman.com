There are times when even the most cynical among us gets a little black
pilled by what’s happening in the world. This week has been one of those
times. The left-wing war on white people has gone from an indirect
attack on whites, often using euphemisms, to an all-out, open call to
get whitey. We now have a congressman demanding white people be
registered in a government database. You can be sure someone will arrive
at the idea of having us microchipped like we do with our dogs and cats.

We are in the middle of a White Fright. The same kooks, who were
flooding the internet with claims of Russian election interference, are
now sowing panic over a grand white conspiracy to do no one knows what.
They are now competing with one another for who can conjure the most
bizarre conspiracy theory. The similarities between now and the mood of
France in the summer of 1789 are obvious. The Great Fear was a panic
that gripped the peasantry, while the White Fright is gripping our
rulers.

The depressing part of it is seeing the so-called conservatives grovel
to these kooks and lunatics. Of course, Trump revealing to us once again
that he has always been nothing more than a vainglorious bullshitter,
who got lucky in 2016, only makes the mood much darker than it would be
otherwise. If you are a white person, these are the worst of times, but
life is struggle. Fair or foul, we are destined to live interesting
lives and the government will be made aware of us. The Chinese scholars
will get that.

The thing to keep in mind with all of this is the kooks are not working
from a clever plot hatched by super-geniuses. The anti-whites are in a
full panic because their handlers and leaders are in a full panic. They
truly fear that they waited too long to slam the cage door shut and now
it may be too late. The great vibrant future they imagined is not right
around the corner. It is never going to happen. That’s what terrifies
them. That’s why they are unleashing the rage heads and crackpots.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
