I expected to be traveling this week, so I planned the show in advance,
but some unexpected misadventures changed my plans. I liked the show so
rather than do something new I kept it. The only thing I regret is I was
not able to talk about Trump destroying girl power on CNN this week. It
was a masterful performance that was reminiscent of his 2016 campaign.

The crazy thing about it is the people at CNN seemed to think that girl
power would be able to handle Trump. What were they thinking? Megyn
Kelly was ten times better at being girl power and Trump wrecked her
career in one show. Kaitlan Collins is supposed to be CNN’s new star and
now everyone is laughing at her. Even the crazies have turned on her and
CNN over this event.

The destruction of girl power was not the best part of the show. The
audience was laughing right along with Trump. There was one shot of the
crowd where older women were holding their hands over their mouths as
Trump described his recent court case with the crazy woman. They were
laughing so hard they were afraid their dentures would fly out, so they
had their hands over their mouths.

Again, what in the world was CNN thinking? Reportedly they just let
people in who wanted to be in, rather than hiring actors as is now
standard. Those normal people were there because they at least think
Trump deserves a chance. That meant he had a chance to win the crowd. It
was if someone at CNN decided to stack the deck against girl power so
she came off looking ridiculous.

This was also bad news for Team DeSantis. This was the old Trump, the
guy who won in 2016 mocking the establishment and their pieties. He did
not do that in 2020, because he thought he had to be restrained as
president. He is not president now, so he seems to think he can be
himself. That and he seems to have no illusions about winning any
friends in the establishment.

Trump is not going to win the 2024 election and may be forced out of the
primary by party shenanigans, but it was good to see the old Trump
again. He was always best as a wrecking ball, mocking stupid people like
girl power. What made Trump fun in 2016 is that he revealed these people
to be feckless airheads. That is what we need more of, so it is good to
see the old Trump again.
