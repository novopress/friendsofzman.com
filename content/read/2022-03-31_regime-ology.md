Regime-ology is a new field of study so the practitioners are still
working out the tools and methods for interpreting regime activity.
Unlike Kremlinology, on which regime-ology is modeled, the focus is not
on a hierarchical structure. The Soviet empire was run by a vertical
organization that operated like a corporation. The American empire is a
horizontal organization modeled on the Mafia. It is a collection of
elite gangster organizations jostling for power within the elite.

With Kremlinology, events could be interpreted as either a signal from
the party elite or representing internal party changes. If someone
disappeared from the public eye, it meant he had fallen out of favor
with the party leaders. If party media reported something hanky about a
party member, it was assumed to have been done with the permission of
the party leaders to prepare the public for a change. The target was
being shaped as a scoundrel so he could be denounced.

Regime-ology is a bit more complicated. If someone disappears for a
while, it could mean nothing more than he is having a blood transfusion
at one of Google’s secret rejuvenation centers. On the other hand,
disparaging information about an oligarch in regime media could simply
mean that one mob family is unhappy with another mob family and this is
how they are communicating it. Using the media promotes the interests of
the gangster class and delivers the message.

That is probably how to interpret the sudden interest by regime media in
the famous Hunter Biden laptop from two years ago. For those not
interested, this was the laptop that President Biden’s drug-addled son
abandoned at a Delaware computer shop, which contained a trove of
embarrassing information about the family. In addition to thousands of
naked selfies and pics of Hunter smoking crack and meth with
prostitutes, it had details of the Biden family criminal dealings.

Regime media dutifully covered this up by declaring it Russian
propaganda and going as far as to imply it was a Trump campaign dirty
trick. The New York Post, which was the first to report the laptop
story, came under withering assault from the Silicon Valley crime
families until they dropped the story. Facebook started banning people
from their site for mentioning the story. Like the people air brushed
from official photos in the Soviet Union, this story was erased from
public view.

This is nothing new. The power of regime media is in what they can make
the public ignore and this was a typical example. They do this by
framing the issue as good guys versus bad guys, which is catnip for the
American moralizer. Then they declare the thing to be ignored as the
black hat and let the moralizers do the rest. Anyone mentioning the
laptop on-line or even in private conversation was declared a crazy
QAnon conspiracy theorist by others in their circle.

For no reason at all, the laptop story is back. First the intel
community told the New York Times to admit they lied two years ago about
it being fake. They did not mention that it was the intel community that
lied, of course. Then the Washington Post was <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-china-laptop/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">told</a> to write about the Biden
family’s criminal dealings that were on the laptop. The Post is the
official organ of the intelligence community. You will recall that the
Post was instrumental in the Russian collusion hoax in 2016.

Even more interesting, the scandal ridden outlet CNN has been given the
green light to unleash their nutters on the story. This is a <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/30/opinions/garland-trump-hunter-biden-laptop-obeidallah/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> posted by Dean Obeidallah, a
former circus clown and far-left conspiracy theorist. In addition to
being a conspiracy hub, CNN is also a popular landing spot for disgraced
members of the intel community. Andrew McCabe and Josh Campbell landed
there after being forced out of their jobs. The FBI uses CNN to control
the Antifa/BLM community.

Taken together, this new interest in the Hunter Biden laptop story
suggests the intel community is unhappy with the Biden crime family. It
could be a warning shot about the recent rantings by Biden in Poland.
This has created huge problems for the foreign policy gangsters running
the war with Russia. They have been forced to spend their time telling
European leaders that Biden should be ignored. This is not a good look
for the Global American Empire in the middle of a crisis.

One way to look at this is that they are preparing the way for Biden to
be removed from office this year. The plan was for him to pretend to be
in charge through the midterm then hand things off to strong diverse
female. Team Biden has been making plans for him to run again in 2024,
while he is clearly in rapid decline. The Hunter Biden story could be
the leverage to force Team Biden to stick to the deal. He takes the
blame for the midterms, retires for health reasons and the laptop
disappears.

On the other hand, this could be the start of a plot to hang the Ukraine
debacle on Biden and his crooked son. The regime media is being told to
sell the Ukraine war as a smashing success, but that can only go on for
another month. Reality in the ground says the Russians are slowly
grinding up the Ukrainian army. In a month, there will be little of it
left in the east. Whether it is by force or by negotiations, the
Russians will get the terms they laid out last month.

Then there are the economic sanctions. This is proving to be a disaster
for the Global American Empire. The Germans just cut a deal with the
Russians to buy gas in rubles, even through both sides are pretending
otherwise. The Germans will buy the gas in Euros from Gazprom, which
will then convert them immediately into rubles at the agreed upon
exchange rate. This is de facto acceptance by Germany that they will buy
gas from Russia in rubles. The rest of Europe will now follow.

What we could be seeing here is Afghanistan 2.0. The military industrial
complex, the intel community and the foreign policy establishment
opposed the withdraw from Afghanistan, but team Biden insisted on it.
They let Afghanistan collapse and then let Team Biden take the blame for
it. Notice that no one actually responsible in the military,
intelligence of foreign policy realm was fired. We could be seeing the
same thing afoot with the looming Ukraine disaster.

Again, regime-ology is a new field. We do not know what we do not know,
so we are left to our imaginations. Maybe Hunter Biden is so mobbed up
that even the thoroughly corrupt FBI has to acknowledge it. Maybe this
is a feint to distract from something much worse that is in the wind.
All we can know is that Hunter Biden will never be charged and we will
never know the truth about the Biden family corruption. In a gangster
state like America, those things are handled internally.
