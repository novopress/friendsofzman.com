Word leaking out of the Biden White House is that the people actually
running foreign policy got the old man to sign off on the limited use of
ATACMS missiles inside the borders of pre-2014 Russia. The Ukraine press
immediately began to lie about this, as that is what they always do,
claiming that this now means they can launch unlimited strikes into
Russia using American weapons. The Ukraine lobby makes the Israel lobby
look candid and transparent by comparison.

For this unfamiliar, ATACMS stands for Army Tactical Missile System.
This is a supersonic tactical ballistic missile that can be fired from
mobile launchers and has a range of about 200-miles. This is a precision
guided weapon, which means it relies on the American military global
positioning system to reach a precise target. It can carry a variety of
warheads, including nuclear, chemical or biological. Those last two
officially do not exist, but they do exist, and Russia knows it.

That is why the United States has not “allowed” Ukraine to use these
weapons against targets inside of Russia. Ukraine is not actually
operating these weapons systems because they lack the cognitive and
technical ability. Ukraine operators can do the minimal to operate the
system, but the targeting and guidance is done by the American military
hidden away in bunkers in Ukraine. It is a thing everyone knows is true
but pretends is not true to avoid nuclear war.

Despite the lie machine saying otherwise, the latest escalation is
limited to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an ill-fated attack
inside Russia. Their forces are now bottled up there, getting hammered
into bits. This limited use of ATACMS there may be in preparation for a
retreat or just another crackpot scheme to continue a project that has
no chance for success. It also created a problem for the Trump
administration, which will inherit the Ukraine mess in two months.

That may be the real motivation. The Kagan cult is sure that Trump will
make a deal with his bosses in Moscow to abandon those freedom loving
Ukrainians to the Kagan’s ancient enemy to the east. They have two
months to throw sand in the gears in what they imagine will be the Trump
Ukraine strategy. This is one reason Trump has refused to say anything
about his plan for Ukraine to this point. He seems to have figured out
that the people responsible for this war are insane.

Of course, the point of permitting Ukraine to use these weapons is to
bait the Russians into responding. This is a standard neocon tactic.
They provoke a target into responding and then claim it is an unprovoked
“act of aggression” against them. Coincidentally, this is the standard
operating procedure for Israel. They did everything possible to provoke
an attack from Iran, so they could then claim to be the innocent victim
and then call in the United States to wage war on Iran.

That is the real concern between now and January. If the neocons running
Biden foreign policy continue to poke the bear, the Russians can always
take the restraints off Iran, which would like to send another volley of
missiles to Israel. The Russians have no illusions about the Ukraine
war. They talk about it as a NATO proxy war against them and have
repeatedly warned about NATO escalation. They have made clear that their
responses will not be limited to Ukraine.

This is where the geopolitical game of chess comes into play. The Kagan
cult may also be looking to set a trap for Trump. By escalating in
Ukraine, they may think Russia will escalate in the Middle East, perhaps
leaving it on the brink of war. Trump’s plan to stack his foreign policy
team with Iran hawks is read as a plan to be especially tough on the
Iranians this time around. The schemers running foreign policy at the
moment would love to see Team Trump step on that rake.

Note that the one of the things the foreign policy establishment does is
make it impossible for presidents to negotiate. Every issue around the
world is cast in extreme moral terms and every rival is Hitler. This
means any deal is akin to Neville Chamberlain ceding the Sudetenland. To
even suggest making a deal to resolve a dispute is to acquiesce to evil.
Team Trump looks primed to fall into this sort of trap when they take
over Iran policy, but we shall see.

It is not hard to imagine a scenario in which the Trump administration
is dealing with spiraling of attacks between Israel and Iran. Then the
warmongers in the GOP will be demanding war with Iran. The press will be
full of reports of how the Russians are supplying Iran with weapons.
That means any effort to make a deal with Russia over Ukraine gets the
Chamberlain treatment. For the neocons, this at least buys time to keep
Project Ukraine going.

Of course, the Israel lobby is fine with this. They want war with Iran
as they think the American military will easily defeat them, which will
lead to a collapse of the Iran government, paving the way for Greater
Israel. It is a good example of how the neocons draft on the Israel
lobby to keep their various schemes going. If they can pin down the
Trump admin in the Middle East with another proxy war with Russia, then
according to their logic, there can be no deal over Ukraine.

There are, of course, many other schemes bubbling up in the fever swaps
of the neocons and the Israel lobby. They have two months to poison as
many wells as possible, in anticipation of a Trump administration that
would prefer to wind down the foreign conflicts. It is why no one should
be optimistic about foreign policy under the next Trump administration.
He will inherit a foreign policy establishment that is hopelessly
corrupt.

Even if his team is sober-minded and realistic about he various hot
spots they will inherit, they will be inheriting problems that have been
caused by successive administration who have burnt up a lot of political
capital. That means they walk into a world full of traps. Some have been
set on purpose, while others are just the result of mismanagement over
the last thirty years. Simply making to through the next four years
without a war will be an accomplishment.
