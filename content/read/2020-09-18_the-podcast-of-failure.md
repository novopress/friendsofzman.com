Failure analysis is one of those things that most people do every day,
but they don’t think about it that way. Much of what passes for a work
in a modern corporation is exception handling, which is just solving the
problems that occur when the normal business processes fail in some way.
No one calls customer service to tell them that they are happy with the
product and have no complaints. Those departments and the people in them
exist to figure out what went wrong and remedy it.

At a higher level, smart people making big salaries spend their days
trying to understand why complex systems produce unacceptable results.
There are people who spend every day studying plane crashes, looking for
the cause of the failure. Pretty much every quality control program is
just failure analysis. The idea is to measure success against some
ambitious standard and then look for the causes as to why the standard
is not currently being met.

The one area of life where failure analysis is seldom used is politics.
When the goals are not met, and they are never met, no one asks “How
come this policy did not work as we expected?” Conservatives, for
example, never think about why their side loses almost every fight with
the Left. The ones they win are the ones the Left does not care about
all that much, like moving commas around the tax code. In some cases,
like emptying the jails, the conservative victory was really an own
goal.

In conventional politics, this is fine, as failing is often a career
enhancer. Failing up is such a common phenomenon in Washington that it
is the norm. That’s because a politician failing to deliver for his
voters is usually doing so with the blessing of the inner party or
powerful influencers of the party. Success and failure within an
established political order is defined as helping or harming the
establishment. Modern Washington cares only about maintaining their
cultural and political hegemony.

Outsider politics and reform efforts play by a different standard. Their
very existence depends upon them succeeding. The same is true for
outsider politics, where the game is to alter or overturn the status
quo. Failure in these cases not only means there is no change to the
established order, but often the reformers and their supporters suffer
serious consequences. It’s why understanding failure is paramount for
outsider politics and political reformers. Mistakes can be lethal.

Strangely, there is very little failure analysis in the graveyard of
right-wing resistance to Progressive aggression. For close to seventy
years now, all efforts to stop the Left’s march though society have
failed, and no one bothers to think about it. Instead, it is just more
calls to keep doing the same things over and over. Today, for example,
so-called conservatives keep bellowing about the constitution, while
they sit at home obeying lock down orders.

If there is going to be an alternative to the liberal democratic order,
it must start with first accepting that all past efforts failed. That’s
a difficult emotional hurdle for most, because it means questioning
important assumptions. It is much easier to keep repeating the same
chants than to honestly question your own beliefs, but if the trajectory
of American politics is going to change, it must begin with accepting
that the past is a graveyard of errors.

That’s what the show is about this week. Putting it together, it quickly
became clear that it is a very big topic. I could probably do a couple
hours on every segment. The failure of Buckley conservatives could be a
multi-part Dan Carlin series. Sixty-five years of failure is a lot of
failure. Still, a good first effort is to introduce the concept and
maybe get people thinking critically about what has been tried and why
it failed. The reason we are here now is the prior efforts did not work.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
