For those old enough to recall the 1970’s, the present economic turmoil
looks a lot like the stagflation from fifty years ago. Just like a half
century ago, we have a mix of inflation, economic stagnation and
incompetent leadership in Washington. Joe Biden is not exactly Jimmy
Carter, as Carter was an honest man, but like Carter, the public sees
him as a man out of his depth. Like Carter, he wound up in the job due
to a crisis within the political class over a previous president.

It is a comforting parallel for many people, because if the pattern
holds, it means there is a Ronald Reagan coming after Biden. The saner
elements in the ruling elite will rally to a sober minded governor who
can withstand the progressive crazies. Many people are looking at Ron
DeSantis as the man who can save the system. Trump running in 2024 could
throw a wrench in the story, but maybe the ruling elite has a plan to
get that element out of the script so the story can continue.

This problem with the script is a reminder that historical parallels are
like all generalizations in that they are a starting point. They help
frame the times to better understand the details. We know the general
plot of one side of the comparison, so it allows us to infer things
about the other side. From there we have a basis from which to analyze
the present. In this comparison, however, the observable similarities
have different direct and root causes.

For example, the current energy crisis is different from the crisis in
the 1970’s, which was mostly driven by the currency war and an oil
embargo. The collapse of the post-war currency arrangements not only
gave us inflation, but it also created havoc in commodities, which are
sensitive to currency fluctuations. The big driver was the Arab oil
embargo over US support for Israel. The embargo was always a short term
strategy to get a better deal from the West.

The present energy crisis is primarily systemic. Generations of
mismanagement are finally showing up in the price. The United States was
the largest exporter a few years ago, but then the government reversed
course and exports have collapsed, making America a net importer again.
Europe is smashing its energy system in an effort to make the Russians
look bad on Twitter. There is more than enough energy to go around, but
the system to distribute it is collapsing.

In the 1970’s, the solution to the energy crisis was to make a deal with
the Arabs so they would end the embargo. There were lots of new energy
schemes launched to take advantage of the crisis, but the final solution
was a deal with the Saudis. This current energy crisis does not have a
simple solution. In the West, energy policy has been corrupted by the
same cranks who have corrupted the culture. It will take a revolution to
fix that problem in order to fix the policy problems.

Systemic problems are also at the heart of the inflation crisis. In the
1970’s, the issue was the old fashioned Econ 101 problem. There was too
much money chasing too few goods, resulting in inflation. This time, the
issue is more about systemic problems in the global monetary system and
in the global supply chain. This is where dumb people like to say, “it
is as simple as…” and then finish with their favorite bromides from the
Mises Institute, but the current inflation crisis is not a simple one.

For starters, the monetary system that was put in place in the 1980’s
assumed a few things that are no longer true. One was that the excess
dollars created by Washington would be absorbed and laundered by low
cost counties. This worked while Asia had an infinite supply of cheap
efficient labor. Extra dollars could flow into these countries as
economic investment. The extra from developing countries would then
return in the form of assets like treasuries and equities.

That system is breaking down for two main reasons. One is China is
becoming a mature industrial nation, which means labor is no longer
cheap. The Chinese understand this and they are shifting policy to
encourage domestic consumption rather than focus on exports. All of a
sudden, those extra dollars are no longer as welcome in China as in the
past. Instead of returning as assets to America, they hang around the
system chasing too few retail goods.

Another cause is the breakdown of the dollar system. The dollar itself
is doing great, but the rest of the global currencies are not doing so
well. Their strength has been pegged to the health of the system based
on the dollar being the global currency. As this system shows signs of
crisis, the weaker currencies are in free fall. The Euro, the secondary
global currency, is falling sharply. Of course, the ruble is booming,
due to the crackpot policy response to the war in Ukraine.

The point is the solution to the current inflation is different from
what happened fifty years ago because the causes are different. In the
1970’s, the Fed could tighten the money supply, wring out inflation and
force a corresponding correction in the system with a deep, but short
recession. This time, simply raising rates will not be enough to address
the inflation problems. It could also trigger a crisis in the financial
system, which is built on the assumption of free money from the Fed.

There are more comparisons like this, but the bottom line is that the
crisis of the 1970’s is similar to this crisis, but the causes are
different. Back then, America was a healthy business in need of new
management. The demographics were good, the social capital was still
strong and the working population was young. More important, the ruling
class wanted a strong America and saw it as their duty to deliver it. A
few tweaks to the system would unleash the economic power of the
country.

The current crisis is driven by different forces. This is an end of
cycle crisis as the American empire reaches its terminus. Critically,
the demographics are much worse, the productive population is old and
the social capital has been spent trying to prove Mother Nature wrong
for fifty years. More important, the ruling class is now populated by
feckless grifters and ridiculous people. They see their duty as throwing
fuel on the fire in order to prove how little they care about the
country.

What this comparison between this crisis and that of fifty years ago
reveals is that this crisis is different in nature. There are general
parallels, but the underlying causes are vastly different and that means
the results will be different. New management may walk through the door
in the next election, but unlike 1980 they will be taking control of an
enterprise that needs bankruptcy protection. It may even require a fire
sale to clear out the unproductive segments at the top.
