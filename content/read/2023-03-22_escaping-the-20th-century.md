It is 2023 and middle-aged conservative pundits around the country are
wondering if maybe today is the day when they bring back the sock tie.
Perhaps break out that “Gipper” lapel pin they got in college. After
all, it is high time that this country be reminded of the greatness of
the Reagan years. Then they think better of it, as they do not want to
ruffle any feathers. After all, that is not who they are. Conservative
principle requires conforming to current norms.

A bit ridiculous, perhaps, but it is not far off. This
<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycarl4/status/1638287756307881986"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by conservative pundit Jeremy
Carl on Twitter is a good example. Ronald Reagan has been dead for close
to twenty years and he has been out of public view for thirty years. For
the tens of millions of people who entered the country after Reagan
opened the border, he is at best a guy in their history books, no more
meaningful to them than the other long dead white guys responsible for
the scourge of whiteness, they are told.

In other words, Reagan and the politics of his time are about as
relevant to this age as those old clothing styles in the closets of
conservative pundits. Reagan and his movement were a product of the 20th
century, primarily the Cold War. What we call conservatism was just a
radical approach to fighting communism. Note that Reagan’s lasting
influence is all negative. Corporatism, open borders and a massive
military are what he passed onto the 21st century.

It would be unfair to lay the present crisis at the feet of Reagan as he
was a man of his time dealing with the issues of his age. He could not
know that his military buildup would lead to decades of reckless and
pointless violence. No one imagined that his economic reforms would lead
to the financialization of the economy. Global capital with the reach we
are seeing was unimageable in the 1980’s. The world “trillion” was an
abstraction for most people.

Even so, it is not hard to make a case that in the long run, the world
would have been a better place if Carter had won in 1980. The neocons
would have been cut off at the pass, thus sparing the world of their
senseless violence. We most likely would not have got the same currency,
banking and regulatory reforms that we got under Reagan, so we may have
avoided the blossoming of global corporatism. This is all speculation,
but you can make an argument for 1980 being the inflexion point.

Putting that aside, conservatives are not the only ones trapped in
amber. The people they pretend to oppose are also spending every night
at the museum. After the Cold War, what we call the Left went back to
put on their old 1960’s radical outfits so they could relive their salad
days, but this time as the man. For the last thirty years it has been a
revenge tour by the culture wreckers who thought they got short changed
when they rioted in their youth.

It went unnoticed, but in the Obama years, it was if they were working
from a list of slights they endured over the prior decades. The Iran
deal was about avenging the “arms-for-hostages” issue. The Russian reset
that everyone now forgets was about avenging Carter. When they were not
revisiting past defeats, they were reviving old causes like black
radicalisms and sexual liberation. Just like their conservative buddies,
the so-called Left is trapped in the 20th century.

This weird dance through the halls of the museum of the 20th century is
most obvious with the war in the Ukraine. This <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/03/18/pax-americana-or-pox-multipolar/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by Thaddeus McCotter at American
Greatness is emblematic of the mindset. The triumphalism following the
fall of the Soviet Empire froze everything in place. No one on either
side of the political class can think beyond the point when the West
declared the end of history. Therefore, nothing can be allowed to change
from that point in time.

Alexander Dugin has written about how the end of the Cold War was a
disaster, which strikes most Western readers as sour grapes. It
certainly was a disaster for Russia, but who cares about Russia? She
deserved it for losing. Of course, what he meant is that the Cold War
provided a moral framework for the world. When it abruptly ended, that
moral framework ended with it. All of a sudden, there were no rules and
what has followed has been chaos from the Eurasian perspective.

From the Western perspective, it has been worse than chaos. “If God does
not exist, everything is permitted” is a common Russian expression. In
fact, it greatly influenced the thinking of Nietzsche. For the West, the
requirements of the Cold War filled the role of God, limiting the
excesses of the ruling class. When those restraints were removed, what
followed was an orgy of excess leading to the current crisis, made worse
by rulers who are trapped in the past century.

Max Planck famously said, “Science advances one funeral at a time” and
that may be what must happen for the West to escape the current crisis.
As the geriatric class of leaders fades from the seen, they will take
their antiquated worldview with them, leaving open the possibility for a
new world view. Whether the West is governable as currently composed
will be the defining question, but it will not be answered by those old
men with their sock ties and Reagan memorabilia.
