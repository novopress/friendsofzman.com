Over the last several years, America has experienced a new phenomenon in
which people critical of official dogma suddenly endorse the dogma. An
alternative form of this is where people who have made a career
debunking claims that appear in the media suddenly become the most
faithful consumers of media propaganda. It is as if a new virus has
entered the system that causes the victim to switch sides or reveal
themselves to be a double-agent all along.

The Trump phenomenon was the first example. When Trump famously came
down the escalator to declare his candidacy, many assumed it was just a
publicity stunt from a guy known for showmanship. Some went a bit far in
criticizing it but Trump is one of those guys who can rub some people
the wrong way. Once it was clear that he was a serious threat to be
nominated, it also became clear that those harsh critics had contracted
this new mind virus.

Granted, we did not know it was a mind virus. When Bill Kristol started
waving around Hillary Clinton signs, it was just assumed he was bitter.
In fact, that was the assumption about all of the neocons who were
ranting about Trump. He had torpedoed their guy Jeb Bush so their
attacks were just sour grapes. Jonah Goldberg was sure his old lady was
going to land a job in the next Republican administration so Trump was a
huge blow to his plans.

We now think that Trump triggered the forgotten Trotsky gene. All of
those old neoconservatives and their progeny who had been posing as
conservatives for fifty years have the Trotsky gene. Trump triggered it
and as a result they instinctively returned to their natural state as
hyper-violent leftists. At least it was assumed that Trump triggered it.
Further evidence suggests that a virus of some sort was in the air that
was the real cause of the neocon reaction.

Ironically, it was the presence of another virus that revealed the
presence of this prior virus in the population. The Covid panic, which
was fostered by the managerial state, triggered a reaction in some of
the harshest critics of it. Instantly, people who had made careers in
media criticism, usually around the issues related to the humans
sciences, became totally trusting of the media. Everything in the press
regarding Covid was treated as holy writ.

Strangely, this uncritical acceptance of media messaging was
particularly hard on the old HBD community. These are the people who
spend their days thinking about the biological diversity of humanity. As
a result, they spent decades picking apart the blank slate claims in the
media. Their message for generations has been that you cannot trust the
media to talk honestly about biology. Then all of a sudden, they
accepted all media claims about Covid without question .

It was not just the HBD people who were gripped by this madness over
Covid, but they were the hardest hit by it. This is when the possibility
of the cause being a virus started to make some sense. People whose
psychological immune systems have been tuned to defeat a specific sort
of media agitation were probably most vulnerable to a different form of
media agitation. It is why they have never recovered from the infection,
despite the revelations.

The war in Ukraine has brought a new outbreak of the virus. Many who
chanted “fake news” during the Trump years are now festooned with
Ukraine symbols and carrying on like the remaining Biden supporters. In
fact, the most fanatical supporters of the regime are people who used to
be Trump partisans. Sean Hannity, for example, is demanding nuclear war
over Ukraine. He repeats whatever is in the mainstream media regarding
Ukraine as if it is gospel.

Granted, the talks show circuit types are mostly carny folk who go where
they think they can get an audience, but there are more sober minded
examples. Victor David Hanson has been uncritically repeating media
claims about the war. He seems to be fond of the
[narrative](https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/opinion-columns/victor-davis-hanson/victor-davis-hanson-can-ukraine-ever-win-2559125/)
that says the Russians planned to sack Kiev, but the Ukrainians
heroically defended their capital. He is lending his credibility to
nonsense made up by children at the New York Times.

The war in the Ukraine is another clue that we are dealing with a virus
that causes the victim to trust the mass media. Many of the people who
got Covid all wrong at the start are now on the wrong side of the war in
Ukraine. They either have staked out the wrong position or they are
accepting media narratives. This madness transcends ideological
orientation. The victims, once infected, lose the ability to critically
judge what is being presented to them.

Further evidence of a virus, and that it may be deliberate, is the
sudden chanting of the terms “misinformation” and “disinformation” by
the media. Maybe the virus has a different impact on sociopaths than it
does on other people. Media people infected by the virus become
paranoid, sure that a secret cabal is feeding them lies. Perhaps the
virus causes a moment of clarity which then induces madness. This is a
topic that needs further research.

The cause remains unknown, but the madness we have seen over the last
half dozen years points to some common cause. Perhaps this is just a
symptom of modernity or maybe this is what cultural collapse causes in
people. A mind virus of some sort is always a possibility, given what we
have witnessed. Regardless, a plague has spread across society causing
the subversives to go public, the  skeptics to become trusting and the
media to go insane.
