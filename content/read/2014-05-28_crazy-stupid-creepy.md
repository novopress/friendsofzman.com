rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This very weird and slightly
deranged column</a> by an old liberal white woman in the Washington Post
is getting lots of traffic. She is listed as a music critic, but that
does not seem like a real job. It’s more of a hobby, like being a model
train enthusiast. Then again, maybe there is a position in the media for
covering hobbyists. Like higher education, the mass media is full of
made up jobs and titles.

*As deranged manifestos go, the final YouTube video made by suspected
Isla Vista, Calif., mass murderer Elliot Rodger was remarkably
well-made. Filmed by Rodger in his black BMW, with palm trees in the
background and his face bathed in magic-hour key light, the six-minute
diatribe — during which he vows revenge on all the women who rejected
him and men who were enjoying fun and sex while he was “rotting in
loneliness” — might easily have been mistaken for a scene from one of
the movies Rodger’s father, Peter Rodger, worked on as a director and
cinematographer.*

*Indeed, as important as it is to understand Rodger’s actions within the
context of the mental illness he clearly suffered, it’s just as clear
that his delusions were inflated, if not created, by the entertainment
industry he grew up in. With his florid rhetoric of self-pity,
aggression and awkwardly forced “evil laugh,” Rodger resembled a noxious
cross between Christian Bale’s slick sociopath in “American Psycho,” the
thwarted womanizer in James Toback’s “The Pick-Up Artist” and every Bond
villain in the canon.*

David Berkowitz thought his dog was telling him to kill people. The dog
did not make him crazy or make him kill people. Berkowitz was crazy and
crazy people think the family dog is telling them to kill. Some
percentage of crazy people act on these delusions. It’s sad and we all
hope that one day science can address these biological problems, so that
spree killing can be eliminated from life. Until then, crazy going on
rampages is a feature of modern human existence.

If that day comes, people like Ann Hornaday will still be out there
looking to “find meaning” in the randomness of biology. Frivolous people
who feel some need to speak in public will always be with us. If emoting
about random acts of violence is taken away, they will find another way
to annoy us.  It would probably be better for society to solve the harpy
problem before the mass shooter problem, but a society willing to do
that will not have either problem for very long.
