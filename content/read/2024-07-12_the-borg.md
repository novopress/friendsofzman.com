I decided to call this show The Borg, after the fictional entity in the
Star Trek universe, but I could have gone with Self-Licking Ice Cream
Cone. The thing that this show describes is a self-perpetuating system.
The purpose of Conservative Inc., and all nodes of the managerial
ecosystem, is to maintain itself by defending itself from outside
threats through assimilation and subversion.

The trouble with the self-licking ice cream cone idea is that it
suggests the self-perpetuating system is benign. The United Nations, for
example, is not actively trying to change much of anything. The damage
it does is incidental to its existence, in the same way the damage done
by the postal service is just the result of it not being particularly
good at delivering letters and packages.

The Borg concept, on the other hand, is an aggressive entity. It
sustains itself by seeking out and assimilating new life forms. The
process by which it sustains itself is a constant danger to everything
around it. Cancer, for example, destroys its host by replacing good
cells with cancer cells. The death of the host is not incidental to the
existence of cancer, but the end point of it.

This is true of managerialism in general and specifically true with
regards to anything resembling an American right and Conservative Inc.
The conservative ecosystem that forms up one part of the political class
exists to absorb, assimilate, and subvert anything viewed as a threat
along its assigned place on the wall. Since its purpose is to do those
things, it has evolved to find causes and people to assimilate.

The minor controversy over Project 2025, a scheme hatched by The
Heritage Foundation, is a good example, one used in the show this week.
Its purpose is to assimilate what it can use from the populist uprising
led by Trump, subvert his efforts, and snuff out anything that cannot be
assimilated or subverted. Heritage is the Borg queen of the hive mind
that is the conservative industrial complex.
