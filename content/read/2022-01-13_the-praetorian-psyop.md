The Pentagon <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/guerrilla-war-exercise-to-be-fought-across-rural-north-carolina-counties-army-warns/ar-AASDjEy"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will be conducting
guerilla warfare training in North Carolina in the coming weeks. The
point of the exercise is to train American soldiers to battle “seasoned
freedom fighters”, according to the Army. They say they made the
announcement so that the public would not be shocked by the sound of
weapons or the sight of the soldiers conducting war games. The exercises
are going to be conducted on private lands in the western part of the
state

This announcement coincides with the Department of Justice <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/united-states-national-security-terrorism-899caf47624dd8741d04f73e65659e68"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcing</a> the formation of a
specialized unit focused on domestic terrorism. According to the DOJ,
“We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial
animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and
anti-authority ideologies.” What they are saying is the hysterical
reaction to the January 6 protests is entirely justified as there is an
invisible army out there <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bomb-incidents-bomb-making-surge-us-officials-warn-rcna9781"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">making bombs</a>.

Many assume this is about the ongoing shift toward treating all
opposition to the regime as domestic terrorism. The color revolution
they orchestrated against Trump will become a full-time revolution.
Politicians will go on about the threat to our democracy while agents of
the secret police drag people off for made up crimes. Liberal democracy
is in its terror phase. The gross violation of rights is justified by
the perpetual state of emergency over the alleged threat to the system.

There is some of that, for sure, but the FBI has been framing people as
domestic terrorists for generations. They used to work with organized
crime to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Edward_Deegan"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">frame people</a> for murders committed by
gangsters. That made the FBI look good and they did not have to do any
real work. They
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">orchestrated</a> antiwar protests in the 1960’s and
racial crimes in the South during the civil rights era. They framed too
many people to count during the Bush years in the name of fighting
Islamic terrorism.

In other words, the FBI and the rest of the intelligence agencies have
never needed a reason to abuse the rights of Americans. The reason these
organizations came into existence at the same time the American empire
went global is every empire needs a secret police to prevent domestic
enemies. Empires do not treat the core population very well, so they
have to worry that the core population will get tired of sharing the
wealth and revolt against their rulers.

There is another reason for these announcements. The intelligence
agencies have broken free of civilian oversight. We saw this in the
Trump years when they spied on his campaign and tried to frame any
number of people in order to perpetuate the cover-up now known as the
Russian collusion hoax. Chuck Schumer told Trump in public that he
better not take on these agencies as they have a six million ways to get
him. The politicians fear the intelligence community.

A big part of their power is the ability of these agencies to perpetuate
fear among the people in the political class. It is why they tried to
frame Congressman Matt Gaetz for sex trafficking early last year. Every
member of Congress looked at what was happening and thought about their
younger days. If they could ring up a sitting member of Congress for
being a party boy in his youth, they will do anything. Also note how the
media did not report on the disposition of the case.

That is what is going on with these ostentatious displays over the
alleged domestic terrorism threat. The FBI and DOJ looked at the way the
political class reacted to the January 6 protests and realized they
could use their fear as a tool of control. A few times a year they will
arrest some patsies for trying to attack a politician and then use these
as examples at public hearings. The FBI will never have to answer
another difficult question from Congress.

This is also a nice bit of insurance in case the people screw up again
and vote Trump back into office. The FBI and DOJ assume that Trump will
do what they would do if the roles were reversed and that is seek
revenge. Any digging around in the FBI or DOJ will be met with howling
about Trump’s links to domestic terrorism. The Russian collusion hoax
will be replaced by the insurrection hoax. The media, of course, already
knows the drill so they will be all over this too.

There is another aspect to this. Orwell noted how authoritarian regimes
needed an enemy to rally the people against. He was a socialist so he
naturally thought a traitor to the cause made for the best villain.
Emmanuel Goldstein from 1984 and Snowball from Animal Farm were both
modeled after Trotsky. Liberal democracy, on the other hand, just needs
non-democratic enemies. They do not have to be from the ruling class to
be a useful villain to rally support.

In the last thirty years, the empire has had many types of Muslim
baddies to use as the designated threat to democracy. The American
police state was built as a defense against this alleged threat. Russia
has been conjured into a global threat to democracy for the same reason.
Now they are manufacturing all sorts of domestic baddies to be the great
threat to the system. The intelligence agencies are always right there
to confirm the regimes worst fears.

It is not that people are sitting around saying, “We’ve got to protect
our phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.” This fear of what lies outside the
snow globe that is imperial politics just comes naturally to people who
have to no real purpose. Politics in a managerial state is ceremonial,
having no real impact on life. Despite their lofty titles, the people in
the political system feel utterly helpless. Fear and paranoia are the
natural consequences of their impotence.

In the end, nothing much will change for the Dirt People. When the FBI
needs some trophies to display to Congress, they will round up the usual
suspects. Sure, many now wriggle through the net as even the dumbest
have caught on to how this works, but there is always at least one idiot
willing to play along. Otherwise, the domestic terrorism unit will be
creating security theater for the political class. They will be the
narrator telling them to fear what lies outside the Capital Beltway.
