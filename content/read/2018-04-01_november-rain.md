The conventional wisdom says the Republicans are headed for a bloodbath
in the November midterm elections. Sadly, it will not be a literal
bloodbath, but it could be a big swing in the House. The Senate is a
different issue, as most of the seats up this time are currently held by
Democrats. Many of them are in states that tilt Republican and many are
held by blockheads like Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. The House is where
the Democrats have a chance to claw back larger capitol offices.

Now, there are some things to keep in mind when thinking about this
stuff. One is the mass media is just the propaganda wing of the Democrat
party, so they will be endlessly <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">gas lighting</a> us from now until
November. Then there is the fact that the gerrymandering of House
districts has made most of them bulletproof. About 15% of seats are
truly competitive now. There’s also the fact that the Democrat freak
show tends not to show up in midterms. T

To get some sense of what could happen this November, I took a look at
<a
href="https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2008/federalelections2008.shtml"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the district by district results</a> in
presidential races over the last three cycles. If a Republican held a
seat during the Obama years, it is a safe bet that the seat is solid
GOP. If a Democrat held the seat, despite blowouts in 2010 and 2014, the
safe bet is the seat is solid Democrat. The result is 183 seats that the
GOP will always win and 194 that Democrat will always win.

That means there are 58 house seats that are in play this election.
Redistricting and local issues will always play some role. Then there is
the fact that solid districts can swing to the other party because the
default candidate is weird or corrupt. Still, the fact that incumbents
win 85% of the time and we have 13% of the seats in the contested
column, means the real election will be over roughly sixty seats this
fall. The “Great Shellacking” in 2010 resulted in 63 seats swinging to
the GOP.

Another aspect to this midterm is the fact that Hillary Clinton did not
win any of the solid GOP districts and she only won in eight weak
Republican districts. Even more interesting, she won in just five
toss-up districts. The Democrats perform like a regional party, with a
small number of high intensity zones. This has been true since 2006,
when the Democrats last had a good midterm. In order to win a toss-up
district, they have to put up a candidate that does not remind the
voters of his party’s leadership.

There’s also the local flavor. A district like Arizona’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
is a good example. The district went Clinton in 2016, but had been solid
GOP for the previous four presidential elections. In 2012, the Democrats
won the seat, but lost it in 2014. The Republican incumbent then
trounced the Democrat in the 2016 election, despite the district tipping
to Clinton. Voters don’t always punish their representative, just
because his or her party is run by idiots. The idiot you know is better
than the idiot you don’t know.

The challenge for the Democrats is to find 26 seats held by Republicans
that they can flip this November. Assuming the solid districts on both
sides, there are 58 “in play” districts this election, give or take. Of
those, 33 have been pretty reliable for the GOP. That’s defined as going
Republican in presidential elections, even when the Democrats won the
White House. That leaves 25 truly vulnerable Republicans in the November
midterm, plus or minus the results of redistricting, bad candidates and
so forth.

Now, the party holding the White House often does poorly in the midterm
elections, as the loyalists of the party out of power are full of anger.
They’re still mad about losing the last time. Here’s the breakdown of
midterms going back to Reagan.

Democrats do vastly worse in midterms than Republicans when they hold
the White House. This is a familiarity breeds contempt issue. The
average net loss for the Republicans is about 12 seats, with a high side
of 30 under Bush in 2006. That 2006 election is probably the absolute
bottom for the GOP. The Democrats rely on outlandish lies to get their
way into majorities, so they suffer greatly in midterms. Their average
loss is 31, which reflects a swing back to normal after a presidential
election.

The GOP can look at history and figure they probably hold the House just
on inertia. Even when the voters are really mad at them, like 2006, the
losses are not catastrophic, despite the claims by the media. After the
2008 election, the media was carrying on about the dawn of the
Progressive utopia. In reality, the country remained mostly Republican
in inclination and that was proven out in the following midterm. The
fact is, the GOP is the majority party in America, because it is the
party of the white middle-class.

Now, the one sure way to keep the House in the hands of the GOP is to
make sure the Republican president in popular. Reagan was suffering in
the polls and his party suffered as a result. Bush was popular in 2002
and his party did well. Clinton was very popular in his second midterm
and his party did well in that election. If the GOP wants to avoid a
disaster this November, they would be wise to help Trump get over 50% in
the polls. The obvious way to do that is help deliver on his campaign
promises.
