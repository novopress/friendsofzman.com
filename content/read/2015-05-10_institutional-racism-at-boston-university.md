> In another tweet from January, she wrote, “Every MLK week I commit

>
> In another tweet she called white males a “problem population,” Fox

>
> The tweets were first discovered by University of Massachusetts

> “SoCawlege.com.”
>
> Mr. Pappas questioned Ms. Grundy’s ability to teach in a diverse

> “You have to teach college aged white males eventually, no?…this seems

> Mr. Pappas told the network that he hopes to “show the rest of America

Sociology is one of those areas in colleges that have become a dumping
ground for below average college students who should be turning knobs at
a car plant. Instead they get tax money to waste time in nonsense majors
like sociology. No one has ever dialed 911 hoping to reach a
sociologist.

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This reminds me of something that Razib
Khan posted</a> the other day, that I found utterly ridiculous.
Self-reporting depends on self-awareness. The greater the
self-awareness, the more accurate the self-reporting. You can’t tell me
much about yourself unless you know something about yourself. No group
of Americans is as lacking in self-awareness as progressives.

This BU example is where you see it. Can anyone argue that a white
professor would keep his job if he tweeted that “young black males are
the problem facing America”?? We know the answer. A few years back the
president of Harvard was hounded off campus for pointing out, correctly,
that girls are generally not as good at math as boys.
