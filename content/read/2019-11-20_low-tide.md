“When the tide goes out you find out who’s naked” is an old gag in the
Wall Street world, often attributed to Warren Buffett. He likes to
include it in his annual letters to investors. What he means by it is
the risk positions of a company are only known when they face adverse
conditions, like a downturn in the economy. Others have used a version
of the aphorism to mean that you find out who is a smart investor when
the market takes a downturn. Similar idea, broader application.

The same sort of thinking applies to politics. Like most Wall Street
traders, the political class is the last notice the tide going out on
them. Most came into the game during a rising tide and came to assume
good times are perpetual. If you live in the Imperial Capital, this
sense is reinforced by the fact it is always a boom time, in terms of
the economy, around Washington. Every year trillions of dollars flow
into the city and those dollars don’t spend themselves. It’s always
Christmas in the DC.

The tide does go out in politics. The moderate Democrats learned that
lesson in the early 1990’s as the party began to radicalize. For the
longest time they got to play the old game of talking like a normal
person at home, but going along with the radicals when it came time to
vote. Then Newt Gingrich figured out how to exploit this contradiction
and the moderate wing of the Democrat party was eliminated in the 1994
midterm elections. The tide went out and the moderates were naked.

Something similar happened with the neoconservative cabal that had
controlled the Republican Party for decades. Their appeals to normal
white guy patriotism had been so effective at directing support for
their endless wars in the Middle East, they just assumed it would work
forever. They did not see the growing backlash on their Right until
Trump captured the Republican nomination. Their reaction to the tide
going out on their enterprise revealed things about them best left
concealed.

One of those things revealed in 2016 was just how much these people
despises their target audience. That in turn has raised an age-old
question about the sorts of people in the neoconservative movement. A
warmonger like
<a href="https://twitter.com/JonahDispatch/status/1195692520241586176"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonah Goldberg</a> never met a
war you should not fight on his behalf, but he is always ready to
lecture you on your moral failings while you wage that war on his
behalf. What low tide for the neocons meant was the stench of an age-old
hatred for the victims of their perfidy.

Today the tide is going out again and this time it is the remaining
figures of Conservative Inc. showing their nature to the world. Nick
Fuentes, the young YouTube personality, has become a bug-light of sorts,
for grifters to immolate themselves on in a fit of moral outrage over
the groypers. It is as if there is a secret contest to see which one can
put on the best smug face as they shriek about Fuentes. One after
another, the dull and the witless have stepped forward to bleat their
unhappiness.

Here we have bugman
<a href="https://twitter.com/baseballcrank/status/1196503174246481921"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dan McLaughlin</a> claiming he
sees the army of the invisible Hitlers all around Fuentes. Here we have
bourgeois hausfrau
<a href="https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status/1196302233198923778"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Claire Lehmann</a> warning
about tricksters between trips to the liquor cabinet.
<a href="https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1196762699285377024"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Cardillo</a>, who
everyone assumed was dead, turned up to remind everyone why that would
be his best career move. The only thing that guy needs is a pic of
himself on his Harley that he never takes out of the driveway. He’s the
B-roll of a documentary on boomer conservatism.

Another guy who should collect his paycheck wearing a ski mask and carry
a gun is <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/just-what-does-a-guy-have-to-say-to-be-considered-beyond-the-pale/amp/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Geraghty</a> from National
Review. He penned a tantrum that reads like an interview with a teenage
girl after an accident. Not to be left out,
<a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1196845104901832705"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David French</a> chimed-in to
remind everyone that he is the king of cucks.. French is a guy who
stepped over the poor and suffering in his own backyard so he could
<a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1196845104901832705"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kidnap</a> an Africa baby to
tote around as a trophy to his perverted sense of righteousness.

Of course, the guys with a color in their name have got in on the game.
Here we have someone calling himself
<a href="https://spectator.us/groypers-american-fascists/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dominic Green</a> at the
Spectator telling us the groypers are the real fascists. Here’s someone
calling himself <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-outrage-industrys-latest-child-soldier/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt Purple</a>, at the
ironically titled American Conservative, telling us Fuentes is the omen.
Keep in mind that AmCon has <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/scott-ritter-pervert-america-iraq/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defended</a> and
<a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/author/sritter/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employed</a> a guy regularly
arrested for soliciting sex from children. Yet, they are outraged over
talk about demographic reality. When the tide goes out, guys with colors
in their name reveal their perfidy.

That is what is so revealing about these guys swarming to attack Fuentes
and his young acolytes. They are so craven and hollow; they are
incapable of seeing any humanity in these young men. They are antibodies
of the establishment, attacking what they are told is a pathogen.
Nowhere in their attacks do they mention that these are young men,
motivated by a real concern for their future. For the automatons of
Conservative Inc., none of that matters. They do what they are told.

In dissident circles, there is a debate about whether conservatism, as
an institution, is worth saving. James Kirkpatrick has
<a href="https://arktos.com/product/conservatism-inc/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book</a> on the subject and
has talked about this topic at various events. In the end, it may be a
self-answering question. As the tide goes out and more and more of these
people are revealed to be hollow, soulless men without chests, the
conservative enterprise looks shabbier and uglier. At this point, the
question is whether they can withstand the rising tide of the dissident
right.
