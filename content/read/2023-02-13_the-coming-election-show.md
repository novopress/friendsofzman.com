It is hard to think about it, but the first presidential debate of the
next cycle will probably happen in the late summer, which is about six
months off. Assuming the Republicans stick to the old calendar and do
not follow the Democrat plan to rearrange the primary schedule, the
first votes are less than a year off. That means the candidates are now
preparing to kick off their campaigns. Whether we like it or not,
another presidential campaign show is about to get started.

At this point, the action looks like it will be on the Republican side,
as no one is prepping to challenge Joe Biden on the Democrat side. He
may be a vegetable, but the people running the government think he is a
useful vegetable. If the secret document business was supposed to push
him aside, it did not work. Bernie Sanders has been bought off, so they
do not have to worry about him causing trouble. The only plausible
alternative is Gavin Newsom, who has done nothing so far.

That leaves the Republicans to put on a show for us. Of course, we know
Trump is running and is the favorite at the moment. Mike Pompeo lost a
bunch of weight to look better on television, so he is running. John
Bolton says he will run as the blow up the world candidate. Nikki Haley
has thrown her panties in the ring. Tim Scott is now preparing to <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-sen-tim-scott-prepares-for-presidential-run-cd0078f1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announce</a> soon. Amusingly, the
yesterday men of conservatism think Scott and Haley <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/haley-and-scott-would-provide-much-needed-ideological-diversity-to-the-2024-field/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">provide</a> ideological diversity.

The guy everyone is waiting on is Ron DeSantis. He has put on a good
show in Florida, especially with regards to the cultural stuff. He gave
Disney the business over their grooming stuff, so he has won over a lot
of normal people. He recently stepped in to halt the AP Afro history
stuff that amounted to little more than an antiwhite lecture, so he is
not just picking low hanging fruit. In another age, DeSantis would be
the ideal candidate to lead the Republican ticket.

What we see shaping up is a repeat of the 2016 primary. You have a
collection of zombies that have no business in politics, but they are
acceptable to the people who actually run things. Then you have Trump
and DeSantis, who will be filling the Ted Cruz role in this performance.
In 2016, the party could have rallied early to Cruz and maybe had a shot
at stopping Trump, but they waited too long. This time many see DeSantis
as the key to preventing Trump for a third time.

The trouble with that is most of the people running the Republican party
are as delusional as everyone else in the managerial elite. They really
think the voters are waiting for Captain Diversity to ride in and save
them. Tim Scott is like catnip to these people, so they will be drooling
all over him. Of course, Haley is a strong diverse female and everyone
knows the world cannot get enough of strong diverse females, so she will
get lots of support as well.

The wild card is whether the party will fortify the process for
democracy. Politics is monkey see, monkey do, so the Republican party
leadership is no doubt working on a way to fortify the process for
democracy. Joe Biden was made the nominee when the party stepped into to
fix the process and get around all of those voters who thought anyone
was better than a senile old man. You can be sure the most devious rats
in the GOP have been working the problem for 2024.

For all his faults, Trump is the prohibitive favorite. Tim Scott may be
diverse, but his trophy case is empty. He sold insurance for a few years
until he signed on to be a political performer and he has spent the last
three decades being the diverse Republican at various levels. Nikki
Haley is a strong diverse female, who spent eight year criticizing the
South as the governor of South Carolina. She will go over well in
Silicon valley and New Delhi, but nowhere else.

The only plausible challenger to Trump is DeSantis, but boring people
tend not to do well in national politics. That and the uniparty does not
like him. He has the same trouble as Ted Cruz, in that he exists
somewhere between the populist base of the party and the elitists
leadership of the party. Leadership sees him as a potential threat,
while the voters see him as a potential fink. Given his personality and
Trump’s name recognition, it is a tough spot for DeSantis.

None of this matters all that much. If you look at the map you can see
right away the problem for the Republicans. When you tick off all of the
states that the democrats have fortified for democracy, they start with
a lock on the election. For any Republican to win in 2024 it means
flipping states like Pennsylvania that have already cast their votes for
Joe Biden, whether the voters know it or not. Many do know it now, so
they will not bother showing up to play make believe.

This election presents the people in charge with a dilemma. On the one
hand, Trump losing in the primary would let them claim that the popular
unrest has been quelled and it is back to the old ways. The trouble is,
they have fortified the general election for democracy and there is no
way to explain it. If DeSantis is selected as the nominee and loses to
Joe Biden, who is going to think that is legitimate? Even the people at
National Review will start to question the result.

On the other hand, if they install their dream ticket, Tim Scott and
Nikki Haley, the voters will be too busy laughing to bother voting.
Worse yet, they will get smoked in the general election thus
discrediting the diversity scheme. The New York Times will demand that
the Republican Party disband because its voters are so racist, they
would not vote for diversity against dementia. It would be a hilarious
result, but it feels too ridiculous, even for the Republicans.

You can see the problem. Having a vegetable atop the Democratic ticket
when the election has been fortified for democracy quickly leads to
absurd results. Once they started down the road of fortifying lections
for democracy, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the
pretense of legitimacy. In the fullness of time, the robot historians
will say that the great mistake was in not coopting Trump. Reckless fury
led to reckless actions that have made elections into absurd spectacles.
