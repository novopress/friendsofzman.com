One of the struggles for those on this side of the great divide is
maintaining a proper perspective with regards to dissident thought
versus conventional thought. Most people are not on this side of the
great divide. None of the people in politics or the media know that
there is a great divide. For them, the two sides are the extreme far
Left and the so-called conservatives struggling to keep pace with them.
Reading the mass media from our perspective can cause you to question
your sanity.

There is a site called
<a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Memeorandum</a>, which used to be popular with bloggers
back when copy and paste blogging was a thing. It is an aggregator of
mainstream sites that tries to set the tone of daily conversation. The
cable talkers rely on it to set their agenda for the day. It is why our
media feels like an echo chamber. The site is a useful reminder that our
mass media is highly coordinated. These people have daily scrums to
decide what to make up and they direct the rest to follow their lead.

Anyway, when you look at this site, it often seems like the bulletin
board in a dayroom of a mental hospital. Yesterday, <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/capitol-police-chief-violence-state-of-the-union_n_6037dd08c5b6b745c4b58bc6?mc6"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> was featured on the site
along with some others on the same topic. This one was the most amusing.
There is nothing about that story based in fact. It is pure fantasy, but
a fantasy being played out in real time in front of people supposedly in
charge of the country. The loons running the government really think
there are insurrectionists plotting a coup.

As I pointed out in the podcast extra, the January 6th protest has
become the centerpiece of a weird form of security theater. When they
said it was their 9/11, most people rolled their eyes at the absurdity
of the claim. The people inside the wire, on the other hand, they
believe it and they are acting on it. They have convinced themselves
there is an invisible army of Trump supporters plotting a coup. Even the
<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/02/19/suspicious-truck-capitol-riot/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">running dog lackeys</a> on the Left are
getting into it.

It is a good reminder to our side that the security theater of the Bush
and Obama years was also entirely fake. Al-Qaeda and ISIS were real
things in the world, but the people the FBI arrested in the US were
probably just dumb guys they could frame. The police state the neocons
erected was just part of the theater. This is probably a useful tool in
helping people adjust to this side of the great divide. Our rulers have
been corrupt and degenerate for a long time. It’s just more obvious now.

Still, the FBI rounding up a few swarthy guys once in a while and
framing them for imaginary crimes was small potatoes compared to what we
see now. <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1365059178507739143"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This</a> is the sort of thing the Soviets
would have thought was too much. The government is now officially at war
with half the country. It is such an insane turn of events that a normal
person can be forgiven for wondering if he is really seeing what he is
seeing. No one reading this imagined anything like this happening in
America.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

**Promotions:** The good folks at

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
