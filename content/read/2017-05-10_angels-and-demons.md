The general consensus among physical anthropologists is that religion
co-evolved with language. By religion, they mean belief, not the highly
complex and abstract stuff we now think of as religion. Early humans
probably started with supernatural ideas about the forces controlling
the parts of the natural world they could see. Then maybe more abstract
ideas about what happens to people when they die and the need to
properly handle the dead. This is all speculation, but that’s where the
evidence seems to point.

Whether or not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_gene"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">belief is baked into our
genes</a> is debatable, mostly because we don’t know enough about the
human genome. The news makes it sound like science has unraveled the
mysteries of human DNA and we’re on the verge of creating super babies,
but nothing could be further from the truth. There’s also the fact
that people continue to insist that believing in Progressive mythology
is rational while being a committed Christian is delusional. Once again,
Progressive orthodoxy hinders science.

When religion is treated as a subset of mass movements, then the genetic
argument for belief becomes more promising. The person who is always
caught up in one cause or another is well known. It is not unusual for
someone to start out in one thing and end up in its opposite. The
Christian, who gets into radical politics and ends up as a spiritual
gluten free vegan into hot yoga. Some people are highly prone to getting
caught up into mass movements, while others are disinclined to join
anything, even when they agree with it.

The true believer latches onto a cause, in part, because of a deep
belief in magic or the super natural. The crazy cat lady into aroma
therapy will have a long list of wacky reasons why certain smells have
magical powers, but it’s still just magic. She does not know. She
believes and she gets satisfaction, a psychic reward, by exercising that
belief. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Half of Iceland believes there
are invisible elves</a> on the island, even thought no one has seen an
elf. They are invisible, after all. It just feels right to believe they
exist.

The ruling class of America seems to be particularly prone to belief in
the supernatural, despite their alleged love of science and reason. You
see this in their obsession with racism. Our betters talk about racism
as if it is a demon spirit. The anointed, invested with the spirit of
good-think, are tasked with exhorting the rest of us to resist the Dark
Lord of Racism. <a

School. Anathea Portier-Young sounds like she is organizing an exorcism.

Puritan ministers use to talk like that about Satan. Racism is no longer
just normal clannishness based on race. Now it is a magical, almost
indescribable, force that creeps up on little cat feet to possess the
soul of those who are not vigilant. These seminars all have a
revival quality to them. The participants are inducted into secret
rights that allow them to resist the Dark Lord of Racism and all his
works. The exhortation to go forth and preach against the temptations of
racism is right out of 17th century Salem.

The late great Eric Hoffer observed that mass movements can get along
without a god, but they must always have a devil. Modern Progressives
have only a muddled sense of a deity, but they have a devil, as well as
a list of lesser demons that do his bidding. Racism is the arch demon in
the cosmology of the Left. It is why everything they don’t like is
associated with racism. Trump, for example, is one of the least racist
guys in public life, but they swear he is the soldier of the Dark Lord
of Racism.

The ruins at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Göbekli Tepe</a> are
interesting for a number of reasons, but one of them is what they
suggest about the nature of man. It was assumed that human organization
was either out of self-interest or out of a sense of cooperation. It
was *homo economicus* or *homo reciprocans*. The fact that
pre-settlement people came together to build what looks like a religious
site, suggests that neither is true. A desire for purpose, beyond the
material, may be the force that drives human cooperation beyond the
bounds of kinship.

Our ruling class has the same desire for a purpose beyond their
extravagant lifestyles as Cloud People. These are people who fully
committed to the meritocratic, managerial system. They are true
believers. Having abandoned Christianity long ago, the ruling
class lurches from cause to cause, looking for a reason to cast
themselves as on the side of angels, in the great moral struggle that is
the human condition. Lacking a deity, a light to give them purpose,
they settle for demons they can slay.
