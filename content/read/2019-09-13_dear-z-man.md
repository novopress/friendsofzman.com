If you look back in the archive, the last time I did a show on Friday
the 13th was April of 2018 and I named the show Triskaidekaphobia.
Nothing bad happened that day, as far as I know, so I did not worry much
about doing a show this time. Now, I put the show together on Thursday,
so it was not really Friday the 13th when I recorded. Maybe a lot of
listeners drove off the road while listening or had men wearing hockey
masks stalk them while they were enjoying the content. Happy listening
today.

I did not do anything on the superstition this week, but I did spend a
considerable amount of time discussing the nature of media. That is, the
difference between watching content, listening to content and reading
content. It is a topic I have thought about from time to time. In fact,
whenever I watch a YouTube show I inevitably look at the views, the
subscriber counts and start to wonder about the real impact of video.
The same thing happens when I look through someone’s Twitter feed.

I’m one of the apostates on this issue. I think Twitter is a waste of
energy. I think it is an echo chamber for the most part. The Left gets
some benefit as their media, which is all media, monitors it for trends,
but otherwise it is screaming into the void. I suspect YouTube is also a
waste of resources. Video is a passive medium, so even though a video
can get a lot of views, people forget what they saw as soon as they are
done watching the video. As a result, video is the least effective
medium.

There’s also the issue with the nature of the audience. My guess is
smart people tend to read more than watch or listen. Dumb people make up
the bulk of the video audience, which has been true of television since
forever. Therefore, if you want to influence stupid people, video is the
way to go. If you want to impact society in a meaningful way, then you
need to persuade smart people and that means the written word. Those
YouTube stars are just making money off dummies.

Now, there are exceptions to every general rule. There are smart and
clever television shows and there are smart and clever YouTube stars.
Stefan Molyneux and Paul Ramsey were pioneers in the field of internet
video. They make smart and clever videos on important topics. They would
be the exception that proves the rule. The vast majority of YouTube
creators are not smart or clever and their audience tends to drool a
lot. I doubt the fans of RamZPaul move their lips when reading.

That said, even smart people have been trained by the internet. If you
want to influence the culture it means making your ideas consumable on a
mobile devise. That’s not to say smart people consume ideas only through
their phone. It’s just that like everyone else, their attention span has
been diminished by the internet. Smart people are not reading one
thousand page books that require hours of quiet contemplation to fully
understand, which means a good writer needs to be pithy and economical.

Again, I could be all wrong about this. Whenever I bring it up, I get
push back from people who insist we need to go back to quill pens and
velum. Then there are those who swear the kids only watch short videos,
so that is the future. Both points can’t be true and maybe neither is
true. Maybe the reason the pamphleteer has been an indispensable part of
politics since the printing press is that the most effective way to
change someone’s mind is with a short explication of your position.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
