This is the last final push to the election. That means the democracy
supporters have just a couple more days to get those ballots printed and
into the mail, depending upon the state they are ballot stuffing.
Elections have turned into Christmas for the elves who are tasked with
making sure their bosses get what they want when they wake up the
morning after the election.

All joking aside, the very weird noises coming from the Biden people
suggest they are plotting a caper next Tuesday. Biden’s chief of staff
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nesYnQzR3Ig" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">issued</a> what he called a final warning about the
election. Of course, Biden’s speech made clear that the only way to
defend democracy is to support the regime at all costs. It was another
form of “by any means necessary” that we heard in the Trump years.

Much like the over-the-top response to Kanye West and now the basketball
player, a repeat of 2020 next Tuesday would serve our interests. The
regime would avoid an embarrassing result on Tuesday, but it would come
at the price of their legitimacy, which would be an enormous price to
pay. Too many people would notice what was happening and draw the
obvious conclusion.

On the other hand, the blowout for the Republicans that dwarfs
expectations would be hilarious and a nice little pick-me-up heading
into the holidays. A night of salty tears and threats from the news
carnies would be good fun. Twitter, given what is happening, could be
hilarious. Sure, it would give normie false hopes, but normie is a sack
of potatoes, trapped in his conditioning.

If I had to guess, the riggers will have a tough time of it this time
simply due to the dynamics of midterms. They also got a late start
because they were sure things were going their way into the late summer.
This time there are scads of “election deniers” on the look out for
mules and ballot stuffers. Lots of people want to be a star for having
caught a rigger red-handed pulling shenanigans.
