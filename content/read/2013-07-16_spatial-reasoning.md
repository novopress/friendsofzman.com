[Steve Sailer has a link up to an interesting
piece](http://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/07/something-intelligent-and-interesting.html)
in the NYTimes regarding spatial reasoning. One of the little discussed
aspects of team sports is the value of spatial reasoning. The ability to
think through problems in three dimensions is a very useful thing if you
are a quarterback, linebacker or point guard. These positions require an
awareness of where everyone is and where they are going. It also
requires an understanding of how the players will react to one another,
the limits of the field and the context of the game.

I’ve often mentioned that certain sports are good indicators of skill at
other sports. Jim Brown had great field vision in addition to his
physical skills. He was a great lacrosse player in college. That’s a
sport that requires high level spatial reasoning. You can be good at
that sport without being a great athlete, but you have to possess that
ability to visualize the field three dimensionally. Otherwise, you can
have no idea what’s happening in the sea of sticks and people. Brown’s
“vision” made him a terror on the football field.
