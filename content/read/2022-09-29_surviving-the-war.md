There was a time when normal Americans thought about how to survive a
nuclear exchange with the Russians. During the Cold War, this seemed
like a real prospect, so there was a reason to think about it. Into the
1960’s school kids had to do the hide under the desk thing, which was
mostly about conditioning people to accept permanent war, but it
conditioned people to the idea of being nuked. How to make it through a
nuclear war became something of an industry.

There were two schools of thought on the subject back then. One said
that any hint of a nuclear attack by either side would result in a mag
dump by both sides. The United States and the Soviet Union were in a
prisoner’s dilemma. If either side showed restraint, then they risked
the other side striking first and possibly making it impossible to
retaliate, so logic said to send all of your missiles first. Both sides
accepted this logic which is why a system was put in place to prevent
it.

From a survival perspective, such a scenario made the prospects for
anyone living through it extremely low. The arsenals at the time were
larger than today and the assumption was they could wipe out all life on
the planet. The initial blasts would kill most people, but the fallout
and nuclear winter would kill the rest. Even if people survived somehow,
the numbers would be tiny. There was simply no point in preparing for
what would be instant death for almost everyone.

The other school of thought was more optimistic. War would escalate with
an initial exchange that might not lead to a mag dump. Even if the will
were there to send all the missiles, many people would refuse to push
the button. The disruption from the initial strikes would also render
communications useless. The example of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Vasili Arkhipov</a> seemed like proof that a full scale
exchange was unlikely. That meant it was possible to survive a nuclear
war if you were prepared.

Today, that last scenario is more plausible. Nuclear arsenals are much
smaller than during the Cold War. No one is really sure that the antique
systems on which these weapons rely would work under stress. The
American ICBM system still relies upon 1970’s technology. The Russian
systems are similarly antiquated. The most likely scenario is that the
major powers are no longer functional after a nuclear exchange, so lots
of people survive the event.

The first step in surviving a nuclear war is to avoid a direct hit.
Washington DC will get several direct hits and the initial flash will
vaporize most of the population. The shock wave will level most of the
city. By now, the Russians and Chinese know to target Northern Virginia,
so it will be a saturation bombing. The five percent that survive the
initial blast will be radiated and die soon thereafter. Therefore, the
first rule of nuke club is to be outside the target zone.

The safe bet is to be away from the coasts. The Rockies or Appalachia
are the best bet for making it through the first stage. Denver will be
nuked, for sure, but the damage will be contained to that plateau.
People in the mountains will escape the flash and the blast, even if
Denver takes multiple strikes. The <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/26/134379296/the-secret-bunker-congress-never-used"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Green Briar</a> will get hit, for old
times sake, but most of West Virginia will be spared. There are lots of
places to escape the flash and the blast in the mountains.

Once things settle after the final missile strikes, there will be four
key things to surviving the aftermath. You will need water, shelter,
food and a way to defend yourself from the people who were not prepared.
Imagine a land ravaged by mask wearing Covidians and you get the
picture. You will have to be prepared to kill a lot of people in order
to avoid ending up like them. This means you need to pick a spot that
has access to water, a food source and is defendable.

Since a post-nuclear America is going to look like the frontier as far
as you are concerned, you are going to need frontier skills. You will
need to know how to make a fire, provide yourself basic medical care and
know how to hunt and fish. If your location is near a river, then you
can initially get by with fishing and water from the river, but you have
to boil the water and cook the fish. The ability to make fire without
modern items like a lighter or matches is essential.

Once you have sorted the location and provided yourself with the
frontier skills required to live in the wild, you need to think about
the defense issue. A man alone is easy prey, even to desperate city
people roaming the countryside. It would be better to have a tribe that
can work together for common defense. That means you either need the
skills to create a tribe from who is left or you have to create a tribe
now. One way or the other, survival will depend upon community.

This basic framework of preparedness is just scratching the surface, but
it does provide the basis for building a survival plan. For example, you
will not want modern firearms for defense in the post-nuclear world.
Making your own gunpowder for modern ammunition is not realistic. You
can make black powder from raw materials. That means the old fashioned
muzzleloader is a good weapon to own and master. Of course, older range
weapons like spears and bows are an option.

The same applies to tools. Creating your own electric for powering
modern tools is possible, but not very practical. If you assume society
takes generations to bounce back from the holocaust, then it makes no
sense to rely upon modern tools. They will break and you will not be
able to fix them. The same would apply to vehicles. Old cars need
gasoline and lubricants. Even if you stock those, they will run out
eventually and your vehicles become lawn ornaments.

This is why forming communities in advance of the holocaust is critical.
You can plan for the two general scenarios. The first scenario is the
world steps back to the pre-industrial age and does not bounce back. The
other scenario is the people responsible manage to survive and quickly
set about recreating the modern world by bringing things like the power
grid on-line. Do you want to play a role in that rebuilding or do you
want to seek vengeance on them?

Community building in advance lets you wargame these issues. It also
makes survival much more likely. No one man can know everything or
prepare for everything, so having help increases your odds of survival
dramatically. It also provides the means for surviving what comes after
the initial devastation. In a post-nuclear world, tribalism will be the
key to survival, which means the best tribe wins. Of course, that is
also why the world was blown up, but that is a story for another day.
