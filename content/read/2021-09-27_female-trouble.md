**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/everyday-lunacy/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. This week it is a
nice companion piece to the regular Monday posting. With Halloween
approaching, it is a good time to focus on witches and the trouble they
are causing. That and it will sell a few books for Ed Dutton. For those
with a soul, the
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/427573" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday podcast</a> is up behind the green door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Early in the Covid panic it was clear that some people were embracing
the panic for reasons that had nothing to do with public health. The
harridan assaulting people in the grocery store over the bizarre new
rules was doing it because suddenly she had a purpose to her life. This
was starkly obvious with the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who
made herself harridan-in-chief.  All of a sudden, inconsequential people
had purpose and meaning to their lives.

The infamous TikTok videos featuring chubby nurses in scrubs dancing
around on empty hospital floors had a similar motivation. White women
with mundane lives working in hospitals were suddenly “front line
workers” in the war against the great plague threatening humanity. Most
of the women working in hospitals just went about their lives but many
suddenly saw themselves in a different role. They were no longer just
faceless nurses doing menial work. They were heroes.

Of course, another big driver of the live action role playing was the
urban legends being traded on social media. In the early days it was not
uncommon for someone to claim she knew several people who died from the
virus. Statistically that was like saying you knew several people killed
by dwarfs. Even today it is rare for someone to know someone who
actually died from Covid much less many people. Even so, it became a
common sighting on social media.

For many people, Covid and the drama surrounding it quickly became the
purpose of their lives, giving them a reason to get up in the morning.
The Covid skeptic, in fact, was largely a creation of the people
embracing the panic. The panic players needed a foil, someone at whom
they could direct the lines “Don’t you understand that people are
dying!” when on the Nextdoor app. The people happy to be left alone were
dragged into the Covid drama to be the needed villain of the story.

You see this with the vaccination business. For as long as we have
understood vaccinations, it was known to be a defense against you
getting infected. If you got the vaccine you were protected. It did not
matter if everyone around you was not vaccinated, because you were
vaccinated. That was the point of the vaccine, but that has been
changed. Vaccines are now a collective good so the unvaccinated can be
the needed villain in this drama.

The <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10027851/Why-suffering-dreadful-Covid-symptoms-testing-NEGATIVE.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest turn</a> in this weird game is a
new phenomenon in which women are sure they have Covid but they keep
testing negative. The women suffering from this new and dangerous malady
in the war against Covid describe it as “spooky” because they really
want to test positive, but they keep testing negative. What is clear
about the women afflicted with this new plague is they are heavily
invested in Covid. In their time of greatest need, Covid is letting them
down.

What is going on here, of course, is something that has been happening
in small ways for some time. We have an abundance of unattached females
in the population desperate for attention. They jump on every fad in the
hope of making themselves the star of some minidrama related to it. You
can probably mark the Virginia rape hoax as the beginning of this
pattern. A crisis invented by political grifters was made real by a
couple of women desperate for attention.

It is tempting to blame this on mass media. Ten years ago, this Covid
panic could not have happened as we have far fewer intensely on-line
people. The SARS and Swine flu epidemics are proof of it. In those
outbreaks, social media was still in its infancy and mass manipulation
with it had not been mastered. Those epidemics were serious and required
a public response, but they never become full blown panics like Covid,
because the tools were not available to do it.

In reality, social media is a symptom. Stand around in public and look
at what people are doing as they wait. You will see far more women
banging on her mobile device than men, unless the area is full of
mothers. The moms will be tending to their children and gossiping with
the other moms. There are plenty of men intensely on-line, but it is
usually directed at things like sports. For women, they are on-line for
the drama and the growth of social media has been in response to this
demand.

This suggests that the <a
href="https://washsummit.com/collections/bestsellers/products/witches-feminism-and-the-fall-of-the-west"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">witch problem</a>, as described by Ed
Dutton, is not entirely a problem of selection and biology. That is, the
potential for witchery is a constant feature of Western societies that
can be unlocked under certain conditions. We have not been selecting for
witchery, but rather creating an environment that summons forth the
demon from the female population. The internet is turning into a
doomsday device that summons exaggerates the worst elements of humanity.

Worse yet, history does not offer an easy answer. In better times, a
round of witch trials and the liberal use of the scold’s bridle would do
the trick. In this crisis, the witches have already taken control. That
means the witch trials are of men who failed to properly compliment a
female coworker who was feeling blue. She then goes to the head witch in
human resources and the victim is dragged in for interrogation. Instead
of witch trials we have warlock trials.

Of course, the hunt for invisible Nazis and white supremacists is
another modern form of witch hunting, mostly led by women. You have a
sprinkling of socially retarded males in the group, but the main players
in the hunt for insurrectionists are hysterical females imagining
themselves being ravaged by a Nazi. In the old days, the witch problem
was quickly addressed, so they never got hold of the levers of power.
Today, the executive suits are littered with brooms.

Putting all of that aside, what Covid has revealed is that we not only
have female trouble, but we cannot ignore it forever. The madness
unleashed over the last year is finally showing up in practical ways.
Prices for essentials are spiking, car production has stopped due to
shortages. Shortage of things are turning up again, just as the brooms
are coming out for another round of female empowerment. There is a limit
to tolerating this and that limit is rapidly approaching.
