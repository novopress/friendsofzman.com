Societal decline is best imagined as a drunk man falling down a long
flight of stairs, maybe a long spiral staircase. He begins at the top,
the peak of the society, then carelessly makes the wrong steps and
begins to tumble down the stairs. It is not a rapid or steady fall to
the bottom. Instead, he hits a landing, rights himself for a bit, but
regaining his confidence he makes another wrong step and takes another
tumble.

Some of the landings are long and he is able to function at that level
for a while, thinking he is still at the place he started. Maybe he
takes a few tentative steps back to the old position higher up the
stairs, but eventually it is another misstep, and he falls back down
past that landing to another landing farther down. This is societal
decline. It is periods of decline punctuated by periods in which it
feels like the decline has been arrested.

This is useful to keep in mind as we watch the new regime come to grips
with the new reality they
faceâ€¦.<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/watch-your-step/"
