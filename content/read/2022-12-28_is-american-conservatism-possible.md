In America, Right and Left are relative terms in that the Right is
defined by its relationship with the Left. While the Left flits from
novelty to novelty, the Right shouts, “please slow down” while following
it around. As Robert Lewis Dabney <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/826117-it-may-be-inferred-again-that-the-present-movement-for"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">put it</a> a century ago, “American
conservatism is merely the shadow that follows Radicalism as it moves
forward towards perdition.” His observation has remained true to this
day. It is why yesterday’s radical idea is today’s conservative
principle.

This is not true in other parts of the world. Radicalism exists, but it
throws itself against the defenses of tradition and history. It may
break down those walls, as we see in Europe, but the contours of the
Right remain in place. European conservatism is the appeal to hierarchy,
tradition and permanence. Joseph de Maistre would be shocked by modern
Europe, but he would still be able to make out the borders that define
the modern conservative forces of Europe.

The opposite is true in America. Take someone from the founding
generation and transport him into the middle of the 19th century and he
would recognize the forces of radicalism quite easily. After all, the
radical abolitionist would look strikingly familiar, having come from
the same stock. Transport that man further into time and he would
recognize the New England roots of the progressive. Conservatism, on the
other hand, would make no sense to him in any age.

That is the problem for conservatives. The rest of the world has
traditions, habits of mind and institutions with roots into the mists of
time. America is a young society, so the ancient customs are not all
that ancient. Most of those were borrowed from Europe during the
colonial period. Others were trampled under the hoofs of one prior
radical pogrom or another. Modern conservatives are left to conjure an
authority due to a lack of tradition and history.

You can see the dilemma here in this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJMk5-2vKI" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">speech</a> Michael Anton delivered to Hillsdale College
on the end of conservatism and the beginning of a new politics. Anton is
part of a project to build a “new” conservatism. Like the “old”
conservatism, his starting point is Lincoln and the “second founding” as
imagined by Harry Jaffa. Note also that the person introducing Anton is
careful to insert the Athens and Jerusalem line into his remarks,
signaling his membership in the cult of Jaffa.

The cult of Jaffa and Lincolnism has been discussed at length here and
other places, so there is no need to go over it again. Of interest here
is the selection of Lincoln as the Abraham of modern conservatism. This
is a bit like picking Karl Marx as your starting point for German
conservatism. In his time, Lincoln was a radical and not just the
bourgeois coffee house variety. He was willing to kill as many of his
fellow citizens as needed to impose his radical vision on the country.

The “new right” would no doubt dispute that characterization of Lincoln,
but you cannot place Lincoln on the Right during his age. Abolitionism
was a radical idea, one that the radicals of the founding generation
rejected. John Adams <a
href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/john-adams-abolition-slavery-1801"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">opposed</a> the idea on the grounds that
it was worse that slavery. Like many of his generation, he personally
opposed slavery, but he understood the danger posed by the
abolitionists. Adams would have viewed Lincoln as a dangerous fanatic.

Of course, in his own time Adams was a dangerous fanatic. The people
trying to form up a new conservatism love waving around the Declaration
of Independence, but that was the most radical document produced to that
point. In fact, the entire founding of the United States was a great
experiment in radical politics. It is not an accident that America is
often called an experiment. The very basis of America is the praxis of
radical thought and it continues to this day.

The truth is America has never had much to work with for anyone trying
to create a genuine conservatism, because America lacks the history and
traditions that would naturally anchor conservatism. Compounding it is
that the limited history and traditions that are available are nothing
but a long journal of one radical experiment after another in the vain
hope of creating that city on a hill <a
href="https://www.americanyawp.com/reader/colliding-cultures/john-winthrop-dreams-of-a-city-on-a-hill-1630/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">John Winthrop</a> imagined when he and
his fellow fanatics landed in the New World.

This lack of necessary ingredients with which to fashion a genuine
conservatism in America is probably why conservatism has been a failure.
When you are reduced to conjuring a novel history in support of novel
ideas, as we see with the current “new right” experiment, all you are
really doing is engaging in your own form of radicalism, just without
the force of authority enjoyed by the Left. Conservatism becomes nothing
more than a parlor game for outsiders.

This is why any effort to produce a genuine alternative to the
prevailing orthodoxy needs to start with an honest inventory of reality.
What can be produced from the materials at hand to create something that
can resist the acid of liberalism? The answer cannot lie within the
liberal tradition. To go back to 1950, 1850 or 1750 looking for answers
to the problems created in those times inevitably means explaining away
the defects of liberalism in order to preserve it.

The place to start with fashioning an alternative to the prevailing
orthodoxy is not in 1950, 1850 or 1750, but in 2050. Given the current
demographic trends, imagine a continent filled with versions of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orania" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Orania</a> and then contemplate the ideology of a people
who can maintain it. This is one lesson we can take from the founders.
They tried to fashion a practical solution for their people at the time.
The next founding will have to do the same thing, but for a different
people.
