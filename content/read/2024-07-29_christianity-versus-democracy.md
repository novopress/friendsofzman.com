------------------------------------------------------------------------

A question that does not get asked very much, especially in public, is
if Christianity is compatible with democracy. Organized Christians in
this age make a point of supporting “democracy” because the people in
charge cannot stop talking about it, but that speaks to the sorts of
people running organized Christianity. They want to be in good standing
with the rulers, an irony that never gets mentioned. The thing they
claim to profess evolved in opposition to secular rule.

Putting that aside, the issue of whether democracy, as in the consent of
the governed through direct participation in governance by the governed,
is compatible with Christianity is an important one. It is clear that as
the West has become more democratic, it has become less Christian. Open
hostility to Christianity is a feature of the class of people who talk
about democracy the most. It certainly seems like the fans of democracy
are not fans of Christianity.

Most people today who call themselves Christian or one of the sects of
what we think of as Christianity are well aware of the hostility, but
they blame secularism or various names for radicalism, rather than
democracy. Christians embrace democracy as much as the opponents of
Christianity, even if their particular brand of Christianity has no
democratic elements. Catholicism, for example, is anti-democratic in
structure, but American Catholics love democracy.

There are, however, Christian sects that do embrace democracy. Baptists
churches, for example, hire their pastors. If the pastor finds a bigger
church willing to hire him and pay him more money, he is free to leave
the old church and join the new one. On the other hand, if the church
congregation or the deacons decide the pastor is not to the liking they
can fire him. Here is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiOWKgvogno" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">video</a> from a Baptist minister giving the background
on why he was recently fired by his church.

The short version of the video is the pastor gave a sermon on marriage
and the role of women that was based in a traditional interpretation of
Scripture. The wife of the youth pastor, a more modern woman, was
offended by the sermon. She and her husband organized a campaign within
the church against the pastor in the video and eventually got him fired
from his post. In the end, they got a majority of the congregation to
agree that either he goes, or they go.

This is a very democratic result. After all, the starting point for
democracy is the assertion that the majority must prevail. While there
is nothing in Scripture that says this is how things must be, most
Christians accept this assertion. In fact, one could argue that the most
important victim of majority rule was Christ. If instead of demanding
Barabbas they demanded Jesus, the world would be quite different. The
point is this congregation and others like it are not organized
according to Scripture.

More important, the way they are organized contradicts a basic
assumption of all religions, not just Christianity. That basic
assumption is that there are some things too important to be left to
man. These are things that are true because the gods or God have
declared them to be true. Scripture does not say adultery, for example,
has to be sorted through a show of hands. For Christians, adultery is a
sin, and it is not up for debate

Without knowing the content of the sermon that the pastor in the video
says was the source of the conflict, it cannot be judged dogmatically.
What matters is the pastor preached in a way that offended the
congregation, or at least a majority of them, so the rest went along
with firing him. If his sermon was theologically and scripturally
correct, then it means the congregation decided they did not like that
part of the Bible, so they avoid it and those who preach it.

The point here is that for Christianity to work, or any religion for
that matter, the main body of its beliefs must be beyond the collective
judgement of man. The collection of oughts and ought nots that make up
every religion are rooted in an authority beyond the ability of man to
question. Otherwise, the oughts and ought nots are rooted in the
collective will of the people. The word we have for this is democracy.
In other words, democracy replaces God or the gods as the moral
authority.

This is why the radicals of the French Revolution firts set their eyers
on the Catholic Church when they gained power. Popular consent could not
coexist with an alternative moral authority or its representative on
earth, so it had to go. The same logic was at work when they eradicated
the aristocracy. Hierarchy is an alternative moral authority to popular
sovereignty, so it cannot coexist with it. The thrown and the altar have
always been the enemy of popular consent.

You see that in the story of the video pastor. The people who engineered
his termination feel justified not because they find support in
Scripture, but because they think they have the support of the majority.
The God they truly worship is not on the Bible but in the show of hands
and their sense of being in the majority. It is not hard to see how this
can lead to what you see with the Episcopal Church. It is rainbows and
sodomites because the god they worship is the god of democracy.

What the evidence leads to is that the enemy of Christianity is not
liberalism or even secularism, but the concept of democracy. Once people
of any faith embrace the idea that truth is the result of consent, there
is no room for God. Any religion that tries to exist in a society that
embraces democracy, will come under pressure to replace its God with the
god of the people. As a matter of survival, Christians should see
democracy as their primary enemy, externally and internally.

This raises an important question. Can Christianity survive in a
democracy. Even if the Church rejects democracy and all its works, can
it survive in a society which is governed by the principles of
democracy? Is there some limit on the democratic impulse that must be in
place and be viewed as unassailable in order for Christian to live in
democratic society. If not, then are Christians obligated to fight
democracy or simply acquiesce to their own destruction?
