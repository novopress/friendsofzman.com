The big news this week was the timely death of Ginsberg. I thought it
would fill more time in the mass media than it did, but I guess the
urban street violence by the Left still ranks higher than old school
Progressive issues. There was some hysterics last weekend and into
Monday, but then it died down. Even the talk of revolution was tamped
down by the party.. Maybe the fix is in as far as the pick or maybe they
think it is bad politics for them going into the election.

That has always been one of the subplots to the riots. The people
organizing these riots are outsiders on the far-left. The money comes
from bourgeois radicals and flows through organizations outside the grip
of the inner party. Just as the Green Party was an outsider attempt to
drag the Democrat Party to the left on certain issues, this is an effort
to drag the party toward hardcore racial identity. The inner party is
white and the future party is non-white, young and violent.

Just as dissidents resist letting the political conversation on our side
shift back to those old conservative topics like taxes and defense, the
left-wing radicals don’t want the political debate to move to
conventional left-wing topics like abortion. That will make for an
interesting conflict depending on Trump’s nominee. The party will want
to do their usual thing about abortion and lady party, but the racial
vengeance crowd will want to keep the party going in the streets of our
cities.

There is a generational issue here. Abortion does not resonate with the
woke women like it did for their mothers. For starters, the
proliferation of prophylactics makes abortion an unnecessary option for
bourgeois women. Second, most of these women are more worried about
their pronouns than having sex. While there is always some man willing
to have a sex with a woman, no matter her appearance, the modern woke
woman is pushing the boundaries of that assumption.

Just as Baby Boomers have had a huge impact on things like education and
health care policy, they have driven the abortion debate. That
generation of women is now past the point of needing to worry about
unwanted pregnancies. Just as spending on schools has fallen away as a
major political topic, abortion seems to be slipping down the list of
Progressive priorities. The Kavanaugh hearings may turn out to have been
the last hurrah for the abortion issue.

Another angle to this court pick is who opposes whom. There is a faction
that really hates Barrett because she is Catholic. There is a faction
that hates her for adopting two Haitian kids. There is a faction that
strongly distrusts her on immigration. The only people who like her are
old school feminists hoping to revive their cause and the anti-abortion
people, who see their chance to seed the court with their guy. It
strongly suggests Barrett is a Trojan horse option.

On the other hand, conventional wisdom says Trump will pick Barbara
Lagoa, the Cuban woman from Florida. She has enjoyed widespread support
from Democrats and she would help Trump in Florida. That may be why the
Democrats have toned down the rhetoric this week. They know that they
will get a sheep in wolf’s clothing from Trump, so they can afford to be
generous. Biden will then be able to claim that his side is the
reasonable choice in the election.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
