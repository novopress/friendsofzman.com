In the fullness of time the ape historians may refer to this time as the
age of reboots because everything seems to be a remake of the past. It
is not just movies and television shows that are constantly rebooted.
Must of our politics is a replay of the 1930’s, the 1960’s or the
1980’s. Every villain is Hitler or Bull Connor, and every victim is Ann
Frank or Emmet Till. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to hear
that the people in charge are planning to reboot the Covid franchise.

Despite a mountain of evidence showing that none of the Covid mandates
made a lick of difference when Covid was a real thing, we are seeing
them <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4167625-mask-mandates-reemerge-amid-upturn-in-covid-19-cases/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">comeback</a> as we get a glimpse of what
we used to call flu season. A few cases of the sniffles have school
systems cancelling classes and installing plastic bubbles again. A
college in Georgia has <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/atlanta-based-morris-brown-college-says-they-are-reinstating-covid-mask-mandates/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">brought back</a> all of their Covid
restrictions. Fake TV <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/which-arm-should-you-use-covid-vaccine-booster-it-does-matter-study-suggests"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">doctors</a> are out pitching the latest
Pfizer products, just in time for the holidays!

The “experts” who told you to tie your underwear around your head and
stand in little circles painted on the floor at the grocery store are
now saying there is a new variant with a really cool name. The <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/well/live/covid-variant-eris-eg5.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eris variant</a>, perhaps the result of
the Evropa Project, is spreading like an untended Hawaii wildfire. The
“experts” say it spreads much faster than the prior variants, which must
be bad. That is why we must act now as we only have a few weeks to
flatten the curve.

Thankfully, the drug dealers have a cure for what ails you. Just in time
for cold and flu season, they have a
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/22/covid-booster-variants-weeks"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">new batch</a> of vaccines. What makes a
reboot so attractive is they already have the IP established. They do
not have to invest in making the public aware of the new thing, so those
savings drop to the bottom line. In the case of the vaccines, they still
have millions of doses of the last batch, so it is just a matter of
slapping on some new labels and handing out some new bribes.

You are probably thinking that there is no way that they can reboot the
Covid franchise so soon after the original finally ended. After all,
public opinion has moved hard against the nanny state nonsense that
defined the original Covid run. Companies are still struggling to get
their people back into offices. Most of the hard thumping Covidians now
pretend they never fell for it. Despite is all, it looks like the Biden
administration is moving ahead with plans to
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">reboot</a> the franchise.

The conspiratorial minded suspect that the regime is plotting some new
shenanigans and forcing people off the streets with Covid mandates is
part of the plan. If you are going to put one of the presidential
candidates in jail, for example, having a ban in place against forming
up crowds would be useful. That way the regime would not have to worry
about another January 6. If protests broke out, they could unleash the
dogs and firehoses in the name of public health.

The more likely answer is that Covid was just one giant leap in the
direction of security tyranny that is all around us now. The health care
system is now full of people who think it is their duty to push you
around for your own good. Every business now has a safety manager who
thinks like a paranoid helicopter mom. Public health officials have the
same attitude as the staff of a prison. They see themselves as your
perpetual guardian and you as a problem they must solve.

That last bit is the vital part. The more people pointed out the idiocy
of the Covid polices the more determined the Covidians were to hold the
line. Just as the managerial elite have come to define themselves in
opposition to the masses, our army of experts define themselves in
opposition to the people pointing out their mistakes. The more the
evidence stacked up that the Covid regime was a sham, the more
determined the Covid experts were to hold the line on the mandates.

Since so much of what animates our ruling class is a redress of past
grievances, this reboot of Covid could be an effort to do it right this
time. The experts will proclaim a public health emergency over Covid.
The public health managers will claim they are better prepared this time
and launch into rounds of public health theater that prove they are on
top of things, while countering the “disinformation” about Covid. It
sounds crazy, but we live in a ridiculous age.

There is also a weird psychology involved in the reboot lifestyle. We
see this with the repeated reboots in Hollywood. Even when it is obvious
that the planned remake of a classic is going to fail, they forge ahead
anyway. Hollywood released a Terminator remake with a decrepit Arnold
Schwarzenegger playing a geriatric robot interior decorator named Karl.
Clearly there is some form of psychosis at the heart of this berserk
desire to reimagine the past.

The big question is whether the public will fall in line again. There
are reasons to think they will not go along with it. The novelty of
working at home has passed, so that carrot is no longer available. The
public is far more cynical about this stuff now, given the endless
stream of official shenanigans. Only the dullest of zombies believe
anything coming from official sources now. This reboot would look like a
farce, even to people who enjoyed the original Covid theater.

On the other hand, cavalier disregard for public opinion is becoming a
charm on the purity bracelets of the political class. If you are willing
to offer Biden’s crackhead son a sweetheart deal with blanket immunity
then appoint a family friend to be the special investigator after the
deal blows up, you might look at a Covid reboot as a way to show your
friends you really do not care what anyone thinks. Spiting the
ungrateful masses with a Covid scare is just the ticket.
