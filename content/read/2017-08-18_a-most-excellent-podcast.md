week, the show is a most excellent podcast. This is due in part to the
events of this week. Nothing inspires me more than being in the middle
of a crap storm. I’m also getting better at this. I feel more
comfortable, but I also feel more confident. That’s because a lot of you
have been kind enough to send along encouragement, It means a lot and I
truly appreciate it.

This week is mostly about the rage virus infecting our rulers and their
hired thugs on our streets. I’ve also got a bit on a SJW grifter, a bit
on Elon Musk, something on the cuckening and a bit at the end that I
like a lot. I was going to call it “A Letter From A Charlottesville
Jail” but I don’t know if most people would get the reference. They
would assume I was in jail. But look it up and you’ll see my meaning
maybe.

This week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and
some new graphics to distinguish the bits from the full show. I am now
on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones.

I have been threatening to stream this to GabTV amd this weekend I plan
to finally do it. I’ll update the site when that is working, if I’m able
to do it.
