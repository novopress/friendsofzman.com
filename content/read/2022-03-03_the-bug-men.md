Imagine one day you wake up to see that some people, but not all, just
the beautiful people, are now wearing flowerpots on their heads. You
first see it on the television while making coffee. Then you see people
with the flowerpot things while on your commute into the office. They
are not wearing actual flowerpots, but hats that look like a pot holding
a shrubbery. Not only are they wearing these ridiculous hats, but they
are also acting like it is perfectly normal.

This is the world most Americans woke up to last week when news broke
that the Russian army had crossed into Ukraine. Suddenly, as if they had
received orders from the hive queen, all of the beautiful people were
Ukrainian nationalists. They were all saying “keev” as if they had
developed some new mental disease. They were sporting Ukrainian flag
lapel pins. At the Biden state of the union show they were dressed in
the colors of the Ukrainian flag.

This is not just a partisan marketing campaign either. The mouth
breathers of conservatism are right there with their masters on the Left
waving the yellow and blue of their new homeland. The same people who
were wearing the angry face about being called a Putin shill a few years
ago are now calling anyone skeptical of this new fad a tool of the evil
Vladimir Putin. The same people who tell us nations no longer matter now
sound like white nationalists in their support of Ukraine.

It is easy to dismiss this as the sort of superficial sincerity that we
have come to expect from the beautiful people. A big part of the gulf
between the Cloud People and the Dirt People is the Cloud People lack
normal human emotions. Instead, it is these programmed responses to
programmed questions. You get more authenticity from an ATM machine than
from Jen Psaki. While this Ukraine fetish is part of the programming, it
reveals something else about them.

These are people who lack all meaning in life. The reason they all
swarmed to the Ukraine stuff is that it allowed them to experience what
they imagine is normal human emotion and community spirit. Their
conjured image of the brave Ukrainians taking up arms against the
aggressor reflects their own lack of purpose. Many Americans have been
reduced to the bug-man existence of consuming product but the Cloud
People are the pinnacle of the bug-man lifestyle.

This is why they are so fond of using analogies drawn from comic book
movies and children’s books. You will notice that the people comparing
Putin to Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter movies are childless. They
did not pick up the reference from watching the shows with their kids.
They are the primary consumers of this material. This fantasy material
has become folklore for people who lack the cultural structure that
provides an adult frame of reference to understand the world.

Dissidents are fond of pointing out how the modern age consumes the
normal social capital, converting it into cash to fuel the consumer
economy. This process has slowly obliterated the natural community of
America. The result is endless miles of generic housing developments
named after whatever it is that was destroyed in order to build these
crimes against nature. We are slowly being converted into pod people who
experience the world via the internet.

The thing is this process is complete among the Cloud people. They are
cutoff from the rest of us, living in a fantasy world that operates by
its own rules. It is why they think it makes sense to lecture working
class people about white privilege while Mexican drug gangs flood
working class neighborhoods with narcotics. It is why Joe Biden’s
programmers think Ukraine is more important than food prices. In their
world, what matters is what gives them meaning.

That is the thing though. Their lives have no meaning because they are
living the fully atomized and transactional life. These are people who
will slit each other’s throat for a better spot on a cable channel. They
have no loyalty, no code, no sense of decency because they are just
particles in a system that exists for its own purposes. It is why the
image of Ukrainians taking up arms is so enthralling to them. Our
bug-man rulers long for even the hint of such a life.

This is why they hate the Dirt People so much. Despite it all, normal
people still try to form and maintain community. They may not be able to
articulate it, but they sense that having beers with a neighbor as they
watch the kids play in the backyard matters more than anything they
consume on-line. The Cloud People hate the Dirt People because for the
Dirt People, Harry Potter will always be entertainment for their kids,
not a guidebook for understanding the world.

Also note the solipsism in all of the Ukraine love. The people wearing
the colors of the Ukrainian flag have only the most superficial
understanding of the people and history of the region. It is why they
embraced the most superficial and meaningless part of Ukrainian
identity, the flag. It is a cheap decoration that lets them feel like
they are a part of something. They are standing with Ukraine with the
same sincerity they do everything else in their hollow and pointless
lives.

You also note that they frame the Ukraine issue as brave innocents
defending themselves from the dark forces. This comes from people who
deliberately lock themselves inside razor wire fences guarded by armed
troops. Their emotional isolation from normal human experience now
manifests as a physical isolation from the people they supposedly rule.
For the Cloud People, Ukraine is a metaphor for how they see themselves
in relation to the Dirt People.

The Devil finds work for idle hands and that is what we see with our
rulers. Much of what ails the West these days is the result of a ruling
class without much purpose as a ruling class and without much meaning as
people. The crisis in Ukraine is the fault of people who use children’s
books to provide meaning to their lives. We not only have an excess of
elites, but we also have a shortage of reasons for them to exist. It is
why they are now decorated with Ukrainian flags. They have nothing else.
