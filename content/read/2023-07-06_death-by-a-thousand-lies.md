On July 4th, a Federal judge in Louisiana issued an <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-appeal-big-tech-collusion-ruling-banning-administration-officials-meeting-social-media-firms"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">injunction</a> against the Federal
government barring various departments from contacting social media
companies with regards to censoring speech online. This is a practice
that started in the Trump years but took off under the Biden
administration. On a daily basis government actors contact the censors
at these companies and tell them which posts to remove, users to ban and
topics that are to be suppressed that day.

In the Trump years, this practice consisted mostly of government
officials calling to complain about things that were obviously fake
about the White House. Given the lunacy of the people running these
companies, the complaints were ignored, but the complaints from fellow
partisans were not ignored. A working relationship between the censors
and the FBI, DHS and other agencies evolved. Under Biden it is one click
away from being enshrined in government regulation.

Most people alive today remember when the media proudly refused to
cooperate with the government on this stuff. They would make a big deal
about not going along with government requests to suppress stories. It
was all a lie, of course, but they felt the need to make a big show of
it. The secret police had long ago infiltrated the major media companies
to shape the news.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_SHAMROCK" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Operation Shamrock</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Operation Mockingbird</a> we both used to
control the media.

The response from the media was much different when the Twitter Files
revealed the level of cooperation between Twitter censors and the
government. The primary response was to ignore the whole thing. This is
the real power of the media. They can simply ignore a story and let it
be buried under a mountain of nonsense about carny folk or conspiracy
theories about things like global warming. The second response was to
trash the reputation of Matt Taibbi who did the reporting.

So far, the media response to this injunction is what you would expect.
On the one hand, they are treating it as a partisan issue. You see, it
is the nasty Republican states that are
<a href="https://archive.is/Mf7P7" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">hassling</a> Biden for no reason at all. On the other
hand, this ruling is preventing the government from
<a href="https://archive.ph/mQWVm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">defending</a> our democracy against election
interference. The brave disinformation researchers are now
<a href="https://archive.ph/7tDOm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">prevented</a> from doing their work to protect you from
words and sounds that threaten our democracy.

Disinformation is information that is intended to deceive, usually from
an official source, like the media or the government. This is an easily
solved problem by having an adversarial relationship between the
government and the media so both sides police each other. Instead, the
media has teamed up with the state to battle this invisible fiend who is
attacking our democracy. It is tempting to call this language Orwellian,
but it is too ridiculous and insane to be Orwellian.

This is a feature of managerial polyarchy that does not get attention.
An enormous amount of time is spent on imaginary things. The Russian
collusion hoax probably cost over a billion dollars in the end. It was
something that obviously did not exist, because it could not exist, but
for the people in the hive it had to exist, so they treated it as if it
were as real as a rose bush. Take a tour through the fever swamps of the
hive and you will see plenty of people who still believe in it.

Then you have the innate need to credentialize everything. Since Grog
sold a faulty wheel to Trog, humans have been trying to deceive other
humans. In fact, the second oldest profession rests on this very idea.
Of course, you cannot have public debate without people trying to
convince others of things that are not true. The argument in favor of
democracy starts with accepting this trade-off. You accept false
opinions in order to encourage the free flow of ideas.

Suddenly, the people who used to claim to be the guardians of this idea
are obsessed with disinformation. So much so they will help the
government crush anyone who dares say anything that has not been
approved. Of course, this means there must be disinformation researchers
and disinformation experts. Colleges are now offering <a
href="https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/courses/GLOB1-GC2051-disinformation-and-narrative-warfare.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">courses</a> on the subject. How long
before we see someone with the title “licensed disinformation
researcher” on a cable chat show?

Notice no one ever asks what a disinformation expert does. The most
likely reason for this is the people in this racket could not tell you.
Here is the Wilson Center’s
<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/issue/disinformation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">page</a> on their disinformation project.
Nina Jankowicz is
<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/nina-jankowicz"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed</a> a senior fellow. Read her bio
and you will see that her only gainful employment has been as a
professional liar, spreading government propaganda. Perhaps the theory
here is the same as the government hiring former criminals to solve
crimes.

If you put “disinformation expert” into a search engine you get millions
of links to stories featuring them. If you search on how to become a
disinformation expert, then you will see tumbleweeds on your screen.
Everyone seems to accept that this profession is real, but no one has
the slightest idea how you get the title. One would think that someone
in the media would do a deep dive into the topic, but that would risk
being accused of disinformation and who wants that?

What this reveals is the inherent decadence of managerialism. Since all
authority lies with the expert, every opinion must have an expert behind
it. The demand for experts is unlimited, so you end up with experts in
things like disinformation. The same process unleashed the army of
bigots known as antiracism experts. In place of a holy book or the word
of the local shaman, moral authority lies with the expert, so the
managerial system manufactures an expert for every normative claim.

There is a practical value to this for the system. These make-believe
jobs provide work for the swelling army of credentialed mediocrities.
There are now millions of people calling themselves “open-source
intelligence researchers.” What this means is they spend all day on
Google, going past the first couple of pages. This is the town busy body
for the digital age. They work with the disinformation experts to get
you banned from Twitter for noticing things.

It is tempting to focus on the un-American aspects of these censorship
campaigns, but the fact is America stopped being a rights-based society
long ago. The important issue is the vulnerability it reveals. The
regime is employing armies of people to control information online and
failing miserably. It turns out that the unguarded entrance to the Death
Star is a well-formed meme. This probably explains why they are <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2023-07-04/political-persecution-douglas-mackey?s=09"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">treating</a> Douglas Mackey like his
public enemy number one.

It is a sweet irony that a regime that is built on a foundation of lies
thinks that its vulnerability is clever lies on Twitter. They are not
wrong about this. The regime of lies was possible because people trusted
the system. People living in a world of lies are not going to trust the
system and they are certainly not going to trust the people who are
responsible for the world of lies. They will seek out alternatives. It
turns out that the answer to the Big Lie is millions of little lies.
