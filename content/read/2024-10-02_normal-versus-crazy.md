Political debates in America are rarely worth the effort to watch mostly
because they are not genuine debates. Instead, they are something like a
joint press conference where the candidates also get to shout at one
another. In a general election, the candidate of the stupid party always
agrees to allow the candidate of the evil party to invite his friends to
be the moderators. The resulting show, and it is mostly just a show, is
about the stupid party candidate fending off the others.

There are exceptions to this farcical aspect of our elections. Once in a
while something will happen in the show to address a lingering concern
of the public or maybe bring out something about one of the candidates
that people have suspected. The most obvious example is the Trump –
Biden debate in the summer. People suspected that Joe Biden was a
vegetable, and this was confirmed in the debate. The subsequent response
from regime media led to his ouster.

There was some of this in the vice-presidential debate between J.D.
Vance and Tim Walz last night. Unless you live in Minnesota or Ohio, you
had no reason to know these guys until now. Vance was a rising star in
the GOP, so he is a bit better known than Walz, but hardly a household
name. Before winning the VP lottery, Walz was an unknown governor from
flyover country. The debate was a chance for both men to introduce
themselves to a national audience.

In the case of Vance, the regime media has been attacking him daily.
They started with the “weird” campaign in the summer and then moved onto
a narrative that says he is dragging down the Trump campaign. They even
floated stories about Trump dropping him, which were all nonsense. His
performance in the debate show put to rest any concerns the media
campaign may have planted in the minds of voters. He was sharp, prepared
and dominated the evening.

What normie got to see in Vance is a guy who is extremely smart and
confident, but also extremely normal. He wove in his backstory when
required, which is highly relatable, but he did not wave his bio around
like a bloody shirt, which is something modern politicians do
constantly. They have to be the hero of their story. Vance came across
as down to earth, despite owning the room quite easily. Even the regime
media had to admit that he dominated the show.

Walz on the other hand came across as a strange combination of Uncle
Fester from the Addams Family and a highly caffeinated Mr. Magoo. Most
of the night he was maniacally scribbling things on a pad he brought
with him. One got the sense that he was taking notes so he could tattle
on Vance to the teacher. Obviously, someone told him that smart people
take notes in these things, so he practiced doing what he thought smart
people do when taking notes.

Of course, the main takeaway from the night for Tim Walz was his
comically weird facial expressions when staring into the camera. You
half expected him to put a lightbulb in his mouth. It was the sort of
behavior that crystallizes a suspicion of him in the minds of the
typical voters. This is a very strange man. His overly-caffeinated Elmer
Fudd routine might be fine for the folks back home, but for the rest of
the country it suggests there is something disturbing about his private
life.

Normally this would not matter, as people do not think too much about
the vice-presidential candidates. At most they suggest something about
the presidential candidate’s strengths or weaknesses. In this case, it
matters a lot because there are questions about both party candidates.
This election is not just about Trump versus the Blob, but about the
future of Republican Party, on the one hand, and the trust in the regime
candidate on the other.

What Harris needed in her running mate was someone who could reassure
the white population that they could trust a boozy bimbo. Harris may be
a simpleton, but the people around her are competent. The narrative they
were going for was what they thought worked in 2008 with Obama. The
young diverse hero supported by the old white establishment man. This
story would be diverse girl boss supported by middle America white dudes
in the person of Tim Walz.

Instead of salt of the earth middle-aged white guy, the Harris campaign
got wacky old guy who gives people the creeps. The debate simply
underscored the fact that the regime candidate is a ham-and-egger thrown
in at the last minute. On the other hand, Vance looked like the guy who
would take over the populist movement after Trump retires and actually
have the skill to implement the agenda. Last night highlighted the fact
that this election is a choice between normal and crazy.

Of course, the specter haunting this election is the rigging. Will we
see waves of phony ballots mysteriously turning up in the dead of night
again? It is hard to rig two elections in a row and always a bad idea to
try it. That is the main reason to think they will try to rig this
election. The regime is in the phase where they never miss an
opportunity to miss an opportunity. If rigging this election is the
worst thing they can do, you can be sure they are thinking about it.

That aside, if Trump does win the election, one reason will be that he
picked the right sidekick this time. It shows he learned from the last
time and that he is thinking beyond the mere vanity of his politics. He
will also have been blessed with an opponent that reminds people of
their last trip to get their license renewed. Her choice of Uncle Fester
as a running mate confirmed that she has no business make lunch
decisions, much less making important decisions in the Oval Office.
