Going forward John will be posting the transcript of his show on the day
of the show, rather than the following Wednesday. The link for that is
<a
href="https://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/RadioDerb/2024-08-23.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. At some point I will post it
here, but that requires transforming it from his web page to text that
will render properly here and that takes some noodling. The software for
this platform is not accommodating when it comes to that sort of thing.

I thought about using the speech to text tools available everywhere now,
but the results are often quite hilarious. I used myself as a test and
the results looked like something you would see in Japan, a country
known for hilariously bad translations from Japanese to English, so that
is not an option. For now, just follow the link to John’s page and you
can get the transcript there.
