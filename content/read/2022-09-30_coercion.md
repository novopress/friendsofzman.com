The other day, a grotesquely overweight black woman was sent out onstage
in her underwear to make noises with James Madison’s 200-year-old
crystal flute. The item was a gift to James Madison in 1813 by the
French flute maker Claude Laurent and has been kept locked away for
decades. For reasons they never bothered to explain, the Library of
Congress let this woman use it as a prop in her circus.

The most likely reason, of course, is antiwhite animus. Hating white
people, especially those from the past, is a centerpiece of the new
religion. The toppling of statues and vandalizing of culture items is
something like a sacrament for them. Publicly flinging their poo at the
works of the white man is a ritualistic break from the culture coercion
from which they seek to liberate themselves.

That is what the show is about this week. One way to look at the great
intellectual flowering in the West is as a quest for liberation, with
liberation being defined as the elimination of coercion. The utopia on
the other side of the revolution is a world where everyone gets to do
whatever they want without the need for permission. You are answerable
only to your imagination.

Karl Marx, who still casts a shadow over our intellectuals, famously
said about the mature communist society, “I could fish in the morning,
hunt in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and do critical theory
at night, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter,
fisherman, shepherd or critic.” In other words, no one would be
compelled to do anything or even be anything.

To normal people, this sounds insane. Most on our side of the great
divide struggle to accept that the people in charge really believe this
stuff. It is a consequence of the moral mind to assume rational motives
for the behavior of others. There has to be a better answer for why they
gave the fat naked black woman a precious artifact from history so she
could revolt us with it and her image.

Lots of people believed in Marxism. Lots of people still believe in
libertarianism and anarchism, despite the mountain of evidence to the
contrary. At least with Marxism, there have been real world attempts to
make it happen. Libertarianism and anarchism never get past the planning
stage. Despite the lack of anything to support their dreams, these
fantasies persist, even among otherwise bright people

The neo-Marxists and their dream of cultural liberation are just as
committed as the libertarians and anarchists. They have not thought
through how the world will work when whiteness is removed. They are just
sure it will be great. The main difference between themselves and the
libertarians is they are well past the planning stage and are trying to
make it a reality.
