rel="noopener" target="_blank">Looks like Obama will launch an attack on
Syria soon</a>.  I would assume this has been in the works for at least
a year, but the chemical attack is being used as a justification or
maybe the chemical attack is fake. One of the things that is hard for
people to come to grips with is that most news is fake. It’s a
combination of propaganda, bias and incompetence. If Obama wants a war,
the media will provide the news stories to justify the war, even if they
have to make them. That’s just life in a no trust society.

Either way, the US military does not move that quickly. The planning and
execution structure is heavily bureaucratic and sclerotic. They need
four or five planning sessions to build a latrine. That’s not a bad
thing. It’s just how big armies of a global empire have to function. The
minute civil war broke out in Syria, the military began preparing
options for their civilian bosses. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This from Wikileaks</a> suggests western
special ops have been working in Syria for a couple of years, probably
since Bush invaded Iraq.

Of course, they have probably been working with Israeli intelligence and
maybe even Saudi and Qatari forces. Then there is the fact that lots of
money can be made from war, especially in a land full of oil and gas.
Mesopotamia has become something of a giant version of Casablanca during
World War II. Everyone and anyone that can make a buck from oil or war
is int he region. War is inevitable, as long as there is money to be
made from war. That means all the great powers are invested in the
region.
