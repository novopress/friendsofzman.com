It used to be that the political conventions were must see TV for anyone
that took their politics and citizenship seriously. Even partisans would
watch the other party convention, just to be informed. That pretty much
went away entirely in the 1990’s when the Clintons came to power. They
introduced all the wretched public relations tactics that are with us
today. The conventions are orgies of partisan bomb throwing and petty
name calling, making them unwatchable.

In the world of lies, you can’t consume these events via news reports,
because the news reports are just paid ads for the uniparty. Joe Biden
could have wandered onto the stage in his bathrobe, talked about which
pills he takes after breakfast and the reports would have called it an
historic speech. Every news outlet is calling his speech “the one he has
prepared all his life to deliver.” They started saying that before it
was delivered, meaning they were fed the line by the party.

The thing is, democracy does fully represent the culture of the time.
The inner party having a dementia patient as their leader makes perfect
sense in this age. The fact that he really was their best option make it
more poignant. Rather than face the next generation of party hacks, they
would rather have a man that captures public sentiment, which is to
forget about the whole thing. If he wins in November, it is the perfect
ending to the liberal democratic experiment.

How many people bothered to watch is a mystery. Again, in the world of
lies we will be told the entire nation tuned in to watch this doddering
old fool. The convention did not draw flies for the week, so the guess
is Biden was mumbling to the choir. That’s what has made these things
unwatchable. They used to be a sales pitch to the general public, but
these days they are the sales pitch to the craziest of crazy partisans.
The normal person is supposed to be offended by the show.

That’s why it is good to be taking a break from the show the next two
weeks. I won’t have to look through the mass media for content to
discuss. Reading agit-prop is not a lot of fun in normal times, or what
passes for normal now, but it is impossible during the election season.
It makes a man think things that should not be thought. What makes it so
infuriating is the fact that people producing it either believe it or
are so horribly cynical they produce it knowing it is nonsense.

That’s the plan for the next two weeks. I have work projects to finish
up that require more time than normal. I have some political projects to
work on and the book is starting to come into focus. I’m about halfway
done the first draft and the outline for the rest is done, so it is just
a matter of writing it. Disconnecting from the media and buying a little
time in the schedule is about as close as I get to a vacation these
days. I’ll still be posting every day, but the show will be on hiatus
until after Labor Day.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
