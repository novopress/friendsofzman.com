A strange example of how not to deal with fanatics is here in <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this posting I saw on the
twitter machine the other day</a>. It is a tantrum about the alleged
lack of diversity in the video game rackets. It is comedy gold.

I don’t know about this particular game, but many games have unicorns
and elves in them. I doubt that the game makers consult with unicorns
and elves about how they depict those characters. So-called “trans
people” are just as mythical as elves. A man pretending to be a woman is
no different than someone walking around thinking they are a hobbit from
the shire. Are game makers required to consult with the people
pretending to be hobbits?

Why this ridiculous weirdo thinks it is any of his business would make
for an interesting interview, but neo-fascists like Tim Mulkerin tend to
avoid these questions. They just take it for granted that they have the
whip hand as cultural commissars.

Maybe banks and law firms should do the same or perhaps Tim should
demand diversity on the Supreme Court of the United States. After all,
three lesbians and just one WASP male suggests a strong bias against the
majority of the population. How about some diversity in the NBA? Not a
lot of the majority population there either. Oh right. Never mind.

There you go. The fact that there is no evidence that so-called
diversity has any value is unimportant. What’s important is it is not up
for debate you bigots. The fact that diversity is actually terrible for
tech companies is besides the point.

What game companies like BioWare are about to learn is that the only
response to the diversity lunatics is a hearty and enthusiastic “Go fuck
yourself!” when they show up at the door. BioWare would make more money
by having a character modeled after David Duke than they would by
catering to mentally disturbed men in sundresses, who also like gaming.
There’s zero benefit in paying the pervgeld to the trannies. You just
end up with a bunch of perverts and deviants in your ranks.

Or worse. BioWare invested in diversity rather than producing a quality
product and <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the result was a shit product
they cannot give away</a>. Lunatics like Tim Mulkerin will claim the
reason is the game failed to include enough blue-haired lesbians on the
development team or some such nonsense, because that is how the mind of
a fanatic works. They can’t change their mind and they won’t change the
subject. The reality is there is no market for this stuff. Gamers want
to have fun, not be lectured by a lunatic.
