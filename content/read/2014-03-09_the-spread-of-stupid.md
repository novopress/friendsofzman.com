Part of getting older is losing patience for stupid people. That means
losing interest in mass media, particularly the commentariat. These are
people who spend all of their time opining about things, but never take
the time to fact check themselves. They have the sum of human knowledge
at their fingertips, yet they can never be bothered to look up basic
facts about their topics. Instead they just repeat the same nonsense the
other chattering skulls have been saying.

<a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s a good example</a> from
John Fund over on National Review. How hard would it be to call someone
who knows something about natural gas? They could quickly tell him that
it is really hard to ship overseas. They would also tell him we lack the
facilities to do it in any sort of volume. It will take decades for us
to built out those systems. We have not built a refinery in thirty
years. The environmental lobbies will never go along with a large scale
LNG facilities near a major port. It’s probably easier to start a
nuclear plant than to build a new natural gas facility.

Let’s look at the building of alternative pipelines into Europe. What do
you think Russia is doing in Syria and Iran?  They want to build a
pipeline through Iran, over northern Iraq into Syria. Tartus would be a
very convenient place to build LNG facilities as it already has port
facilities capable of handling big sea-going vessels. The GCC and Saudi
Arabia would like to build one too, except their pipeline would run
through Saudi Arabia into Jordan to the Suez Canal. Neither of these
plans will be done anytime soon. Given the problems in the region, both
projects are on permanent hold.

Again, all of this stuff can be looked up on-line. Five minutes of time
and you quickly see we are not going to be able to do anything about
Gazprom. Even if he is unable to work the internet, he works for the
Wall Street Journal. he can call people who know about these things.
instead, he repeats nonsense. Most likely, the nonsense comes from the
neocons who obsess of Russia. They feed these lunkheads in the medial
their talking points, knowing that people like Fund will never fact
check them.
