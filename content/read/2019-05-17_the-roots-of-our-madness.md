By the time you are reading this, I will be winging my way out of Lagos
to Nashville Tennessee for the annual American Renaissance conference.
Those of you who will be attending, I look forward to meeting you. I
will be easy to find. For those not attending, I will be positing about
it over the weekend. It is just Friday and Saturday, so I’ll probably
post something Saturday and then something when I get back on Sunday.

This year there is a bit of a youth movement, as many of the speakers
are quite young, but maybe it will be good to have some youth on the
roster. The crowd will be close to a record, so maybe the young speakers
are drawing in a young crowd. There will be some old timers in the mix,
as well, so it is not a children’s crusade. It will be good practice for
me at being an old man in a room full of rotten kids.

This week’s show is a little different. I like to keep things fresh, so
the format is a bit different, mostly due to the fact I could only think
of five sub-topics. The genesis of this week’s theme was something John
Derbyshire covered in his podcast last week. He talked about quantifying
the degree of craziness in this age. I’m taking a shot at explaining the
causes of the present lunacy. You can catch John’s show <a

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
