At the end of the Cold War, the American empire was at the height of its
global influence and power. The verdict of history was that it had the
best economy, the best military and the best political culture. Thirty
years on and no one looks at the American economic model with envy.
China is viewed as having the best economy. While the military has
amazing weaponry, its culture is looked upon as increasingly bizarre. Of
course, the political culture has become coarse and unstable.

The sharp decline in the competence of the Global American Empire is
where the decline is most evident. The place to start is the blunders in
the Bush years, where they miscalculated at every step in the crusade
against Islam. One can argue about whether they should have anticipated
the 9/11 attacks, but the response was poorly conceived and poorly
executed. Like a sports team that takes a far weaker opponent lightly,
the empire survived the encounter with Islam. It did not win.

The Obama years brought new failures. The administration started with
the goal of resetting relations with Russia, which had been soured by
the behavior of the Bush administration in the Russo-Georgian war. They
sent Hillary Clinton to cackle with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov. The Obama administration ended with Hillary Clinton’s election
team manufacturing a smear campaign and conspiracy theory around the now
famous Russian collusion hoax.

The Trump years were mostly filled with noise, but the fact that Trump
was president at all suggested the competence of the empire was
cratering. The system left to the current ruling class was supposed to
prevent both Clinton and Trump. Worse yet, when the system failed and
Trump was selected, the people in charge engaged in a four year tantrum
rather than making the best of it. For his part, Trump spent his four
years giving the Israel lobby a blank check.

The Biden regime has ushered in a new era of bungling. The exit from
Afghanistan was never going to be smooth, but it had to be done. This
was known in the Trump years but the system refused to cooperate with
Trump. A competent system would have let the hated orange man own the
ugly exit. Instead, they left it to Biden and then proceeded to find
ways to blunder no one thought possible. The sight of Afghan herdsman
sitting in abandoned Blackhawk helicopters was a poignant symbol.

Now we have the Ukraine debacle, which threatens global stability. This
crisis is a long time coming so it is not all the fault of the Biden
administration. The Empire has been trying to encircle and destabilize
Russia since the Bush years. The overthrow of the Ukrainian government
by the Obama people and the installation of a puppet government was just
one step in a long process. Biden does own the attempted coup in Belarus
and Kazakhstan.

Ukraine is a complicated place with a tragic history. That history has
mostly been defined by great armies marching through its territory.
Modern Ukraine is the product of the communists committing genocide,
then the Nazis committing genocide then the communist returning to
impose three generations of communism. Since the end of the Cold War,
Ukraine has been defined by corruption and a massive brain-drain as its
people head for the rest of Europe.

Ukraine is the counter to the old De Maistre aphorism about government.
He said that every country has the government it deserves. This has
always been interpreted in the West to mean bad government is the fault
of the people. This is not how De Maistre meant it, but even if he did,
Ukraine shows the idiocy of that sentiment. No people deserve the
governance Ukraine has received over the last century. It is proof that
government is a ruling class tool of control.

It is the corruption that has come to define American policy with
regards to both Russia and Ukraine recently. Senior members of the
political elite have had family members put on the payroll of Ukrainian
oligarch. The most famous of which is the drug-addled son of President
Biden, who was put on the board of Burisma Holdings, the energy
conglomerate owned by Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. Ukraine has
been buying a lot of influence in Washington this way.

Now we have the Russian military moving into Ukraine on the pretext of
protecting both the large Russian population in Ukraine and the two
breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine. This could have been avoided
if the Global American Empire had recognized the reality of the
situation. They could have hashed out a deal with Putin on the issues at
the heart of the crisis. Instead, we got months of bizarre hysteria that
only served to undermine peaceful solutions.

The fate of Ukraine is not particularly important. What matters in this
crisis is the display of staggering incompetence by the empire. They
managed to turn what should have been a minor diplomatic matter on the
fringe of Europe into a global crisis. The result is soaring energy
prices in a time when the global economy is still staggering from two
years of incompetent Covid polices. We have double digit inflation now.
Just wait until massive spikes in energy prices hit the system.

The incompetence does not end here. We are now seeing a parade of
experts from the imperial chattering class compare Ukraine to the
Sudetenland, Putin to Hitler and Biden to Neville Chamberlain. Some are
just yesterday men looking for one last grift before they exit the
stage. Most are people locked into a blinkered mindset bounded by their
ignorance and self-regard. To people with any knowledge of the issue,
they sound like idiots because they clearly do not know what they do not
know.

Much of this public relations campaign is aimed at shifting the focus
from the failure of American foreign policy. The Russia hawks blaming
Biden is a way of shifting the blame from the permanent foreign policy
establishment. That too is another example of the incompetence of the
system. Instead of learning from their error, they are shifting the
blame to a convenient target, so they can continue in error. Thirty
years of failure since the end of the Cold War has taught them nothing.

Put side the armchair diplomacy and what we are seeing is the world
slowly adjusting to the reality of the Global American Empire. It is the
sick man of world politics and the world knows it. Putin easily
outmaneuvered the empire on this issue. The Europeans made sure to not
make any enemies on the Russian side. The empire is left with talking
tough from a distance. This is what the end of empire looks like. The
question now is just how quickly it reaches its inevitable conclusion.
