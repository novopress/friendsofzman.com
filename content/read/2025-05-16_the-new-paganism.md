After finishing the show last week, I thought I left too much on the
cutting room floor, so I picked up those scraps to make a follow on show
this week. With next weekend being Memorial Day, there may not be a show
on Friday, so I figured a sequel to the original while the ideas were
fresh in my mind made some sense. If I do a show next week it will be on
short topics, so send your suggestions.

The thing I wanted to get to last week, but spent too much time bashing
the Protestants, is that we are in an age in which we not only have a
fractured morality, but we also have a fractured metaphysics. The
extreme example is we have some people who think their sex is assigned
to them at birth. If they wish hard enough, they can change their sex
and transcend the two-sex paradigm.

Crazy people are a part of every society, so while these people are
fringe weirdos, they get support from a large and powerful segment of
society. Many of our ruling class question the basics of reality. They
are open to sex being imaginary because they are open to reality being a
shared delusion created by the pale penis people to dominate the
nonwhite population.

It is exceedingly difficult to have a society composed of people with
differing opinions about how society ought to be organized and how we
ought to live in it. If the differences are not too wide, then some
compromise can be made. It is not possible to have a stable society when
large parts of it have a different conception of reality from other
parts of society, which is the present situation.

This new paganism is in some way an effort to create a new universal
morality to replace the old one and use it to clear the decks of the
alternatives. In another way it is an acknowledgement that the
differences in how these different groups understand reality is too
different to ever have a shared morality. Attempts to impose a new
morality just highlight these differences in how we perceive reality.

The Gaia worshippers, for example, are not dealing in practical issues
like the physical world when they demand sustainable agriculture and
renewable energy. These are not real things that can exist in the
physical world as most people understand it. Therefore, it is probably
not possible for them to share the same society as those who think we
should exploit our resources to advance our material existence.

The race issue is where the differences in morality and metaphysics make
clear that the gaps are two large to traverse. If you think magic is why
black people commit so much more crime than whites, you can never find a
compromise with those who think behavior is rooted in biology. There can
be no agreed upon ways to deal with black crime that are satisfactory to
both camps.
