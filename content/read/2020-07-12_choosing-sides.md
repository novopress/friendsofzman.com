At the end of last week, the lead writer for the Tucker Carlson show
<a href="https://archive.is/T4ohF" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">was fired</a> for blasphemy, after it was discovered he
was posting unapproved jokes on an on-line forum under a pseudonym. How
his blasphemy was discovered is unknown, but the keepers of truth have
teams of top women hunting down these people in order to keep their
domains safe from unapproved thoughts. This is, of course, a familiar
story that is now what the old newspaper guys would call a “standing
head.”

Tucker Carlson has not commented on it, but his bosses at Fox News
promise he will have an on-air struggle session Monday.
<a href="https://archive.is/v77Pu" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Fox News</a>, of course, “strongly condemns this
horrific behavior.” By horrific, they mean saying “given how tired black
people always claim to be, maybe the real crisis is their lack of sleep”
on an on-line forum dedicated to snarky humor. Clearly, such words are
so monstrous it is hard to believe a human being could think such
things, much less say them out loud.

In all seriousness, one has to wonder what language is reserved for a
school bus that rolls over on an icy road or the orphanage that catches
fire. This is, allegedly, a news organization, whose job it is to report
events. If edgy jokes are now classified as “horrific” then how do they
convey the image of a school bus flipped over? How can anyone take
seriously their descriptions when they indulge is such ridiculous
emotional hyperbole like this? Teenage girls have more fortitude.

You can’t help but notice how the bold, rock-ribbed defenders of truth
and civility have adopted the language of the Left. Like the old
communists, Progressives now contort the language to such extremes that
it is becoming a genre of humor. How long before they force Sean Hannity
to call Peter Brimelow a running dog lackey? What adds to the absurdity
is the people indulging in the hyperbole are the sorts of mediocrities
you find staffing government offices.

We’ll have to see what Carlson has to say about it, but unless he
dramatically resigns on-air, the one thing we can know for sure is that
when the choice is between his friends on the Left and the people who
watch his show, he will pick his friends. His man of the people act is
just that, an act. Carlson is super-wealthy. If he walked away from his
job, his grandchildren would never have to work a day in their lives. If
he gets fired, it means fly fishing in Maine and ski trips to Aspen.

In other words, his former head writer took more risk posting edgy jokes
on-line than Tucker appears willing take in defense of his writer.
Unless this Neff guy is from old money, he is now going to suffer real
harm. He will not only lose his income, but he will suffer internal
exile for as long as the revolution rolls on. Whenever he applies for a
job, he will have to atone for his crimes against the one true faith. As
a practical matter, he may have to change his name in order to live.

This is the sort of stuff Tucker spends every night railing against. He
has made his name condemning things like cancel culture. For him to
obsequiously go along with his key writer being cancelled makes him a
hypocrite and a liar. It means that in the end, his friends and
neighbors in the ruling class come before the principles he claims to be
fighting to advance. More important, he’s asking you to do what he lacks
the testicular fortitude to do in his own domain.

He’s not alone in this.
<a href="https://twitter.com/charlesmurray" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Charles Murray</a>, the former biological realist,
thinker and writer has gone down the same path as Carlson. After having
got some credit for having stood against the mob, he is now throwing in
with the mob. Like Tucker, Murray would rather be with his friends than
defend the ideas he once claimed to champion. It will not be long before
he is required to burn his own books and condemn his former collaborator

data-ved="2ahUKEwiX_ZC23cfqAhUsoHIEHfSNA48QmxMoAjAlegQIFhAE"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Richard Herrnstein.</a> He’ll
do it with enthusiasm too.

We’ll see what Carlson says on Monday. You can be sure an army of top
people are crafting a speech to keep the sheep in the fold. Most of the
people watching Tucker are so desperate for a champion, they will
overlook just about anything. This is what Team Trump is counting on in
the November election. Opinion does not alter fact. The fact here is
that one of his own was dragged out by the witch hunters, put through
the ritual humiliation of cancel culture and Carlson did nothing.

This is the reality we must accept. This war the ruling class is waging
on white people is not a product of a small cabal within the ruling
class. It is all of them. Worse yet, the war has become a profit center
for them. Would anyone be shocked if Fox News, after having cancelled
one of their own, starts selling “free speech face mufflers” in the Fox
News store? Maybe have Tucker pitch them on his show, right after he
condemns Blake Neff for his horrific language.

In the end, this revolution will end up where all revolutions end.
Everyone will be forced to choose sides and give over their life to the
cause they choose. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The people living in
mansions</a> will find the choice easy. Every day they are reminded of
how well the revolution is treating them. For everyone else, it is more
difficult, but eventually, everyone will have to become a partisan for
their own cause. Everyone will have to be as loyal to his side as Tucker
is to his side.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
