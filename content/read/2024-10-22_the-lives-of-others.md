Since most anyone reading this has been alive, there has been a debate
in what is called the right in America, about what to do about the
right. Going back to the middle of the last century, the debate is about
replacing the opposition to the ruling progressives with something new
or reforming the current opposition. Once side thinks the current
opposition is too corrupt to be reformed while the other camp thinks a
startup has little chance to succeed, so reform is the best course.

If you go back to the early days of the Buckley movement, you find the
same sort of debates going on among those members of the “new right.”
The Buckley people did not have much of an “old right” to worry about,
as it had collapsed in the FDR years, but they had the issue of the
existing institutions. Should conservatives seek to create their own
institutions or seek to take over existing ones? In the end, it was a
mix of both choices that resulted in what is called Conservative Inc.

It is also why there is another debate about what to do with the old
right among people trying to form up a new right. The complete failure
of conservatism was made clear in the Bush and Obama years to everyone
not getting a paycheck from one of the many conservative think tanks and
institutions. Paul Gottfried coined the term “alternative right” in this
period while commenting on the failure of movement conservatism to
conserve anything more than their positions.

Everyone knows what happened to the alternative right, but the sense
that something must rise up to replace Conservative Inc is still with
us. People like Christopher Rufo, Matt Walsh and Michael Anton, all see
themselves in the process of creating a new right for the current age.
Amusingly, all of them are linked to nodes of the old right, places like
Claremont, Hillsdale and others. Like Dionysus, they hope the new right
will be born from the thigh of the old right.

This gets to the impossibility of either approach to creating a new
right. On the one hand, you need money to hire writers, thinkers and
activists. Raising that money one small donor at a time is hard and
unpleasant, at least from the perspective of people who imagine
themselves leading the new right. That means going to the people who
have lots of cash to spare. Those are the people who fund the old right,
which means making an accommodation with the old right.

Of course, if the old right saw a need to reform itself, it would do it,
so the reformers coming in to fix things run into a wall of resistance.
The donors like the institutions as they are, but they would like a
little youthful energy to spruce things up, which is why they invite in
the reformers. Like men who spend a long time in prison, the reformers
are eventually institutionalized by the entities they seek to reform.
Before long they are leading the charge to purge a heretic.

This has been the cycle since the full flowering of the Global American
Empire after the Second World War. The opposition to the prevailing
progressive orthodoxy, on the one hand, maintains a wall between the
establishment and the public, while on the other hand, selectively
recruiting some reformers to provide energy and the facade of opposition
to the prevailing orthodoxy. Notice how all the members of the current
new right sound like exhibits in the Reagan Museum.

It has always been assumed that what makes this system possible and so
durable is the money supply. The golden rule says that the men with the
gold make the rules, so if the donor class exists as it is, both the
progressive orthodoxy and what is allowed to officially oppose it will
not change. There is some truth to it, but there is more to it than just
money. Even the money men find themselves constrained by a system that
they supposedly control.

What has kept this system going is the social aspect of the
commentariat. It operates as a subculture, separate from the larger
culture. People have noted that Washington operates like a small town,
and this is obvious in the commentariat. The people inside depend
entirely on the system for their money, reputation, and friendships. It
is a lot like how one percent biker clubs operate. You are either
completely inside or completely outside the ecosystem. There is no
middle ground.

This is why when it comes time to exile a heretic, all of his friends
rush forth to condemn the man, often claiming to have never trusted him.
On the one hand, they fear being associated with the heretic, but on the
other it provides an opportunity to display their fidelity to the
subculture. Like Brutus stoically standing by as his sons are executed
for their participation in the Tarquinian conspiracy, members of the
commentariat heap recriminations on former friends sent into exile.

As a result, everyone is always looking around for cues about what is
currently acceptable within the system. When your livelihood depends on
toeing the line at the office, you can think about getting a new job.
When your social standing, friendships and family relations depend upon
toeing the line within the political ecosystem of the commentariat, you
can think of nothing but toeing the line. Everyone inside the system,
even the donors, are terrified of being exiled.

This helps explain why our commentariat sounds so weird and alien. Our
chattering classes are like the courtiers who live their lives walled up
inside the king’s palace, talking amongst themselves. Everyone they know
thinks the same things, says the same things and cares about the same
things. Most important, they fear the same thing, which is the outer
dark of exile. The result is a political commentariat that is isolated
from the reality of the general public.

This model of the chattering class applies to the regime media, which is
itself a subculture cut off from the general public. This model also
applies to the managerial class, which now functions as a separate
society, with its own economics, culture and morality, sitting atop the
larger society. The thread that runs through all these subcultures among
the Cloud People is fear of being expelled and having to live with John
the Savage and the rest of the Dirt People.
