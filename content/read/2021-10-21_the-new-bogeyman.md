Last week, the media was buzzing with <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7139a23-1271-43ae-975b-9b632330130b"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">claims</a> that the Chinese have mastered
hypersonic technology. They had flown a hypersonic glider around the
globe and then delivered it to a target. Supposedly the glider was
capable of carrying and therefore delivering a nuclear weapon.
Additionally, the US military claimed to not know how they managed to
pull it off. The implication being that the Chinese have now surpassed
the American empire in military technology.

The official outlet for the Washington regime promptly put out an
<a href="https://archive.md/3G47D" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">essay</a> warning about the threat China now poses. Th
point of the essay is to frame the debate over how best to wage the new
cold war. One side will be dovish and seek to negotiate, while the other
side will be hawkish and want to keep pace with the Chinese. The
compromise will be both sides get what they want. This means jobs and
cash for the army of managerial class flunkies and military contractors.

The one thing the ruling elite agrees upon is that they need a new enemy
and the best one available is the Sino-Russian alliance. On the one
hand, the Russians reportedly have magical powers that allow them to
muck around in the domestic affairs of the United States and its allies.
The Russians are well known meddlers. They are also known for their
hacking. The proof of that is Washington has been complaining about
Russian meddling and hacking for years.

While the Russians are the brains of the operation, China is being cast
as the muscle, supplying the men and arms to threaten the world. Until
now everyone understood that Chinese military technology was not cutting
edge. China has always been a land-based civilization, so that means no
blue water navy and no ability to project power too far beyond her
borders. That is why these Chinese hypersonic stories are being planted
in regime friendly media outlets.

Even in a cynical age, the power of the mass media is real. The steady
beating of the drums about China even has the antiwar people alarmed.
The American Conservative opposed all of the wars against the Muslims,
but it is now <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/taiwan-an-actual-munich-moment/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">hawkish</a> on China. They are even going
in for the “we must defend an abstract concept” ploy that has always
been popular with the regime. In this case, China threatens the
“alliance system” which is suddenly the most important thing ever.

Interestingly, none of the newly minted China hawks have shown any
interest in alternatives to another pointless cold war. America could
use economic tools to put pressure on the Chinese. There is no way the
Chinese can continue to operate without trade with the US. It is a
two-way street, of course, but America outsourced its manufacturing base
to China so a handful of men could get richer, not because we lacked
domestic resources to make our own stuff.

More important, the American empire controls the very basis of the
global economy, which is the money supply. China and Russia can make a
show out of trading with one another in their own currencies, but the
rest of the world is never abandoning the dollar as the reserve
currency. Every wealthy Chinaman has reserves of dollars stashed away in
Western banks. As a result, America can put an enormous amount of
pressure on the ChiComs without a single carrier leaving port.

Of course, no one seems to be interested in the absurdity of having a
tense military stand-off with China yet simultaneously conducting
massive amounts of business with her at the same time. Imagine if in the
Cold War American business was outsourcing critical supply chains to
Russia. How about in the last great war, key industries were sold off to
the Germans? That is what is being proposed, in effect, with this
stand-off with the Chinese over Taiwan.

Then you have the fact that the people rolling out this new campaign to
create an enemy for the regime are the same people who told us that
Saddam was the new Hitler and a threat to the world. They told us they
were bringing democracy to Afghanistan, and they have been telling us
Syria uses chemical weapons on its people. They are the same people who
said Islam was a threat to the West then massively increased the number
of Muslims settling in the West.

It should not take too much cynicism to think that maybe the people who
have lied before are possibly lying now. After all, they lied about the
nuclear program in Iraq in the face of technological reality. Building a
bomb is very hard, requires massive resources and lots of smart people.
Iraq had none of those things. Similarly, the West has been working with
hypersonic gliders for generations. So far, they have proven to be
expensive toys without much military use.

The fact is the threat from China is not really from China but from the
pirates that run the economy who like doing business with China. The
threat is the Western scientist who are willing to take Chinese money to
perform forbidden research. It is the American tech companies willing to
sellout the country for the opportunity to make money helping the
Chinese communists. China is a symptom of a much graver problem, one
that exists in the ruling class of the American empire.

There is money to be made in the next hoax, so everyone with the dream
of living in the clouds will be happy to jump on it. Conservatives will
be allowed to pretend they matter again, so they love this idea. The
military industrial project will get new batches of cash to buy new
toys. The think tanks around DC will get cash to write papers that no
one will ever read. Meanwhile the middle-class will continue to shrink,
and millions of barbarians will keep pouring over the border.
