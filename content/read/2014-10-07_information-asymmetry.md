I’ve written in the past that public debt will one day be banned in the
reforms that come after the great collapse. I’m half joking about the
great collapse stuff, but history says we are due for a

think the banning of public debt will be on the list of reforms is we
keep seeing <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">these stories about American cities being
swallowed up by debt payments</a>.

*Among the many ideas the Chicago Teachers Union have come up with over
the years to save big money or generate gobs of new revenue for our
cash-strapped city, a favorite involves what they like to call “toxic”
interest-rate swaps deals.*

*Here’s the perennial claim, which is making a comeback as CTU President
Karen Lewis contemplates a run for mayor:*

*The city and the school system have thrown away hundreds of millions of
dollars after being duped by big banks into signing deals that locked in
excessive interest payments. If only the city would take legal action,
CTU again argued in a letter to the mayor last month, the money could be
recouped and spent on city services and in classrooms.*

Cities went out and made deals with Wall Street that looked good in the
moment. They freed up cash to buy votes and pay off cronies. States did
similar things with synthetic debt instruments like
<a href="http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/tbcbonds-statemap"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">tobacco bonds</a>. All across the country
we see examples of states and municipalities struggling with bad debts.
That’s not bad debt owed to them but bad debts incurred by previous
administrations.

The libertarians simply shrug and say they should suffer. The neocons
produce 5,000 page plans to restructure the debt using more synthetic
securities cooked up by their brethren on Wall Street. Liberals want ta
debt jubilee. That’s merely a short term fix that destroys the bond
markets for a generation. If the court ever did such a thing, the world
financial system would collapse in a hour because of the trillions of
derivatives that would be effected.

*In contract theory and economics, **information asymmetry** deals with
the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or
better **information** than the other. This creates an imbalance of
power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go
awry, a kind of market failure in the worst case.*

The men on Wall Street who broker these deals are super smart and know
their business better than anyone, other than maybe the guys at the
other banks doing the same deals. The folks running pension funds are
either men and women lacking the smarts to work at the big banks or they
are not sociopaths. They are usually beholden to the local pols and
therefore share their short term motives. They are easy pickings for the
sharpies on Wall Street.

There’s no fixing this. In fact, we used to know this. Pension fund
managers used to spend their days reading the newspaper and banging
their secretaries because all they had to do was buy T-Bills and high
end corporate bonds. Then the economics professions lowered interest
rates to zero and suddenly the guys with bad comb overs had to start
playing the market and doing interest swap deals .

The solution is a simple one. Ban borrowing by municipal governments.
This solves the temptation to play games with public money and public
debt. If Chicago had to budget based solely on its tax base, you would
have a different city. Karen Lewis would not be head of the teacher
union, because there would  not be a teacher union. You can afford
barnacles like Karen Lewis when someone else is paying her salary.
