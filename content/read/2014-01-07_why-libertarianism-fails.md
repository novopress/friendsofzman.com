Now that legalizing the weed is the new thing, it did not take long for
business to jump on the trend. Spirit Airlines is now offering Get Mile
High fares to Colorado.

*Spirit Airlines is known for jumping into the political debate with
it’s irreverent advertising and it certainly wasn’t going to let a
golden opportunity like marijuana legalization in Colorado slip by.*

*“The no smoking sign is off,” an advertisement on the airline’s website
reads. “Get Mile High with $10 off your next flight. Fares so low
they’re barely legal in some states.”*

*On the offer’s landing page, Spirit says, “If you want to make a
beeline for Colorado right now, we don’t blame you — but we’re up to
take you to plenty of chill destinations. … Book today … and be sure to
pack some munchies.”*

*Colorado citizens who are 21 and older are now permitted to purchase
recreational marijuana.*

*Spirit has been known to push the envelope with some of its ads. In
2011, Spirit capitalized on the Anthony Weiner Twitter photo scandal by
offering “The Weiner Sale: With Fares Too HARD To Resist.”*

*In 2012, the airline capitalized on the U.S. Secret Service
prostitution scandal by offering “More Bang for your Buck” for flights
to Cartagena, Colombia.*

This was entirely predictable. Once you legalize weed, there is money to
be made in selling weed. There is money in expanding the market for it
and that means normalizing the selling and consumption of it. The vast
commercial machine used to sell everything from airplanes to pencils
will swing into motion to spread the use of marijuana. That is the
hidden value of prohibition. It prevents the massive marketing machine
that is American commerce from promoting the thing that is actively
prohibited.

While you may not care about this, lots of middle class parents do care.
They will begin agitating for new rules to end the “marketing of weed to
their kids.” A politician, looking for an angle, will propose rules to
curb this stuff. No one will dare fight it because no one wants to be
seen as in favor of selling weed to kids. Before long, we end up with
what we see with cigarettes  or worse. I doubt we see a rollback on the
legalization process, but the rules on weed will make the cigarette laws
look mild by comparison.
