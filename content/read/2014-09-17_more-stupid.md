In theory,  a massive Republican victory in November would be the best
thing for the country, at least what’s left of it. They could bottle up
Barry’s judicial nominees for two years and stop his planned amnesty.
Barry would be a lame duck and spend the next two years planning his
retirement. The Republicans would do nothing to address the many things
that ail the nation, but they would slow the decline.

On the other hand, a loss would throw cold water on Conservative Inc and
the traitors in the Republican Party. The crew at National Review would
be wearing black arm bands for a week. But, there’s the danger they draw
the wrong lesson and lurch even further to the Left. If the 2010
election told them they had to try and compromise with Barry, they will
find some way to <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">snatch failure from a victory</a>.

*Democrats are now (very slightly) favored to hold the Senate majority
on Nov. 4, according to Election Lab, The Post’s statistical model of
the 2014 midterm elections.*

*Election Lab puts Democrats’ chances of retaining their majority at 51
percent — a huge change from even a few months ago, when the model
predicted that Republicans had a better than 80 percent chance of
winning the six seats they need to take control. (Worth noting: When the
model showed Republicans as overwhelming favorites, our model builders —
led by George Washington University’s John Sides — warned that the model
could and would change as more actual polling — as opposed to historical
projections — played a larger and larger role in the calculations. And,
in Republicans’ defense, no one I talked to ever thought they had an 80
percent chance of winning the majority.)*

*So, what exactly has changed to move the Election Lab projection? Three
big things:*

*\* Colorado: On Aug. 27 — the last time I wrote a big piece on the
model — Election Lab said Sen. Mark Udall (D) had a 64 percent chance of
winning. Today he has a 94 percent chance.*

*\* Iowa: Two weeks ago, the model gave state Sen. Joni Ernst (R) a 72
percent chance of winning. Today she has a 59 percent chance.*

*\* Kansas: Republican Sen. Pat Roberts’s reelection race wasn’t even on
the radar on Aug. 27. Today, Election Lab predicts that he has just a 68
percent chance of winning.*

*In addition to that trio of moves in Democrats’ direction, Louisiana
has moved slightly in Democrats’ favor (from a 57 percent chance of
losing to a 53 percent chance), as has North Carolina (a 97 percent
chance of winning now as opposed to a 92 percent chance on Aug. 27).*

The “data lab” at the Washington Post is a room covered in posters of
Barry. Note that around this time in 2006 the GOP was making similar
noises about polling. They were crushed two months later.
