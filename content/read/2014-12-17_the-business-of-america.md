Obama is normalizing relations with Cuba and Conservative Inc is
pretending to be flipping out about it. The usual suspects on the Right
are focusing on the fact Obama is an Socialist, sympathetic to
unrepentant radicals like the Castro brothers. The line of attack is
about Obama’s anti-American impulses, which are real, but not really
what’s at work here. Many on the Right are anti-citizen, which makes
them anti-American, by definition, so their yelping now is a bit hollow.

In reality, Obama is just doing the bidding of American business. The
tourism rackets, gambling rackets and, of course, the bankers see big
profits in Cuba. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This news story</a> from the spring lays
out the case for normalizing relations so big business can cash in on
Cuba. It is easy to forget that Cuba was a food exporter before Castro.
They can also be a source of cheap labor for American business. Our
rulers will also enjoy vacationing there as well.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/world/americas/29cuba.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This NYTimes story from 2010</a> reports
on the machinations behind the long running drive to open up Cuba to
American business. There are 11 million Cubans ready to buy Big Macs,
Coke and whatever other crap we can sell them. How they will pay for it
is a mystery, but presumably Cuba will quickly become a slightly better
version of Puerto Rico. Cubans are better educated than Puerto Ricans so
they should adapt quickly to American tourism.

Of course, the Democrats are reading the polls and seeing a shift in
Cuban-American politics. Young Cubans don’t care about Castro. They care
about getting on the victimization train. They look around at the free
stuff other Hispanics are getting and they want in on the scam too. You
can’t blame them for it. In a balkanized, post-national society, group
rights count for everything. It will be a tribal spoils system so why
not join the winning team?

I doubt Obama and the Democrats have thought it through on that end.
This is just a money grab at this stage. 2016 is looking like a toss-up,
with The Stupid Party probably nominating Jeb Bush. The Democrats don’t
have to concede the election so giving the Chamber of Commerce a big fat
gift will pay off down the road.
