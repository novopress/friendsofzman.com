Every four years the media tells us that this is the most important
election in our lifetimes, maybe in the history of the world. It is
always nonsense, of course, but even if it does turn out to be
important, few people realize it. Hardly anyone realized that the 1992
election, for example, would be an inflection point. The Cold War was
over, and it felt like politics was not all the important.

This time may be different. Trump is a unique figure and has come to
define the first quarter of the 21st century. To understand him and his
time on the stage, you must start with the election of the execrable
George Bush and then follow the chain of events that flowed from that
moment. Trump was the delayed response to the hollowing out of
conservatism and the Republican Party by the neoconservatives.

What the Trump era has come to be about is who is going to run the
country, Americans or a collection of alien weirdos? For their part, the
alien weirdos have made it clear since Trump came down that escalator
that they would rather blow up the world than allow normal Americans to
rule themselves again. The election next Tuesday is the last battle in
the fight between Trump and the alien weirdos.

By all accounts now, Trump is favored to win. If the riggers steal
another election, then any hope you have for a soft landing is gone. The
country plunges into the darkness and whatever comes out decades from
now will bear little resemblance to what everyone understands to be
America. This may happen even if Trump wins, but there is at least the
hope that not all the lights go out.

That is the show this week. This is, at the minimum, a very important
election, but also the last election for a uniquely American figure. No
other country could produce a politician like Donald Trump. Even by
American standards, he is a singular figure, a force of nature who has
changed everything during his time in the arena. Enjoy the last few days
of his last election. You will never see this again.
