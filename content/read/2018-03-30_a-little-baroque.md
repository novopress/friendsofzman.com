This being Good Friday and Easter weekend, I thought it would be wise to
go with some subdued musical selections. I must admit that using Black
Sabbath did cross my mind, but I know I have a fair number of religious
listeners and readers. That and this is one of the times of year I miss
going to mass. As I get older I appreciate ritual more, of course, but I
always liked Easter services. It just felt like there was a sense of
expectation.

A German I follow on twitter mentioned French baroque music the other
day, and the fact that it is nowhere near as popular as German baroque.
The sad fact is, French culture is just not very popular anywhere these
days. It’s a pity, but the exchange got me listening to some French
baroque this week. I’ve decided to use it in the podcast, as it reminds
me of church. I’m sure following this, French baroque will become the
rage in Europe.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
