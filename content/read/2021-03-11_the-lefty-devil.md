One of the most important things the Left in America does in the culture
war is convince their opponents to play the role of devil for them. The
American Left operates like a religious movement, but one without an
inherent purpose. That purpose must be supplied from outside the
movement. It is like a beehive without a queen, always searching for a
queen that will define the threat for them, so they can act on their
nature and attack the enemy in what they believe is defense of the hive.

That is what these causes are for the American Left. The cause itself is
meaningless, because that is just a plot device in the story. It is why
they can be so callous to the people they claim to be championing. The
Left is now attacking feminists who oppose allowing men in dresses to
play girls’ sports. Progressives used to talk about girls playing sports
like it was the most important thing ever, but men in dresses are now
providing the devil, so trannies are what matter most.

This is something right-wing people of all types have never been able to
accept, because right-wing people are wedded to bourgeois objectivism.
There must be some practical reason for why the Left is doing something.
Alternatively, in the case of the tranny-feminist conflict, the Right
starts hooting about hypocrisy, as if that has ever mattered to the Left
on anything. If facts and reason mattered to the America Left, the
American Left would not exist.

What the American Left is all about is the devil, the great tempter.
That last bit is the important part, because it gets to the heart of the
matter. People join causes out of necessity, self-defense for example,
or self-loathing. The former is a temporary condition forced on people
by circumstance, like an invasion or some terrible natural calamity like
an earthquake. The latter is a permanent state of mind. The true
believer is always running from himself.

You see this in the latest left-wing fetish for disinformation. They
have created a new form of shaman called the [disinformation
expert](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22304518/hbo-trailer-upcoming-qanon-movie-disinformation-researchers).
The job of this shaman is to point out targets for the Left to attack.
Disinformation, of course, is false information issued by an
institution, like the media, which is intended to mislead. To be an
expert in this craft is to have been in an institution practicing it. In
other words, the point of this disinformation fixation is to shift the
focus from the people responsible for it.

That is another thing that the Right has always missed. The reason the
Left is always accusing others of things they are doing or have done is
they desperately want to avoid having to even think about themselves.
They are expert at deflection, because the Left is composed of people
riddled with self-loathing. These are people who have organized their
lives around avoiding any conversation about their nature. They
instinctively shift the focus from themselves to others.

This is why [a rich
guy](https://twitter.com/WajahatAli/status/1369781613664608258)
comfortably ensconced in the system can go on jihad against a
22-year-old young man on Twitter. Wajahat Ali issuing fatwas on Twitter
against a kid working from his basement is ridiculous on its face. Ali
works in Hollywood; he writes for the major broadsheets like the New
York Times. Fuentes, on the other hand, is a kid working from zero
institutional support. Yet, Ali and his wealthy audience are sure
Fuentes is powerful and they are weak.

Now, Ali is just a grifter who should never have been allowed in the
country, but his marks in the ruling class are true believers. They are
rich and powerful people, holding positions of authority in the
managerial class. His patrons, who use him like a shaman to direct these
people, are also true believers. These people need an enemy, a devil
onto whom they can focus their gaze. Otherwise, they are left to
contemplate their loathsome selves, which is a fate worse than death for
them.

This is why the tech platforms seem so incoherent in their censorship.
They ban some people but leave others alone. It never makes a lot of
sense until you realize that they want their enemies coming back on the
platforms. They need their enemies in the same way normal people need
oxygen. They keep creating new versions of their platforms in order to
get more devils to attack. The chat site Clubhouse is the latest example
of a site created to manufacture more devils to fight.

The reason our side keeps losing is our guys are stupid and keep playing
the role of bogeyman for the Left. “They are going to call us \[fill in
name of bogeyman here\], so we may as be \[fill in name of bogeyman
here\]” is the mantra of the perpetual loser. It is the fuel the Left
needs to survive. Whether it is responding to left-wing media or playing
the role on their platforms, the right-wing response to the Left has
been conditioned to feed into the innate desires of the Left and give
them purpose.

Counterintuitively, the best weapon against the America Left is to speak
clinically of the Left and about what motivates them. It seems like
these lefty scolds want attention, but in reality, they fear the
spotlight. The last thing they want to do is defend their motivations
and actions. Alternatively, the best defense against these left-wing
provocations is to ignore them. If Fuentes had not taken the bait,
Wajahat Ali would not be flying around on his carpet right now as the
coolest djinn on Twitter.

That is the thing the successful right-wing movement will accept. The
currency of the Left is the attention from the Right. The Left needs an
enemy, a devil, in order to have purpose to their lives. These are
starving souls looking for grace, which comes in the form of attention
from their enemies, real and imagined. The successful right-wing
movement uses this reality to turn the tables, putting the leash on
lefty’s neck, using his desire to be a good boy to its advantage.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
