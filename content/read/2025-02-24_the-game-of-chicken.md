The Trump administration’s opening of direct talks with the Russians
setoff panic in Kiev and the capitals of Europe. The reason for that is
Project Ukraine was centered on the acceptance that there could be no
direct talks with Moscow, until the Russians surrendered their country
to the control of the usual suspects. Trump’s call with Putin and then
the meeting in Saudi Arabia violated this central assumption. First
there was panic and now there is a game of chicken.

The Trump administration has concluded, after assessing the situation
inside and outside the issue of Ukraine, that normalizing relations with
Russia is in the best interest of the United States. One of the
obstacles to that is the war in the Ukraine, so logically they are
looking to wrap up the war as quickly as possible. The Russians have
agreed to talks with Ukraine but insist on elections in Ukraine first.
They point out that by the laws of Ukraine, Zelensky does not have the
power to sign a deal.

Russophobes argue that this is a stalling tactic, but they are the ones
demanding the unconditional surrender of Russia before any talks can
start, so this is the usual projection that is a feature of the
post-liberal West. The Russians, having been burned by the Minsk
agreements charade, want the next deal to have teeth, so they are
insisting that it be signed by the internationally and domestically
recognized leader of Ukraine, which means new elections.

The Russians would probably drop this demand if the EU were willing to
co-sign whatever deal is struck, but such an offer will never come. The
reason is the whole project relies on never having direct talks with the
Russians. This is the trap setup in 2023 to keep everyone committed to
Project Ukraine. Ukraine passed a law forbidding direct talks with
Russia in exchange for unlimited support. Europe signed on in exchange
for unlimited support from Washington.

The reason the Biden administration expedited the remaining weapons and
money allocated to this project was an effort to prevent the incoming
Trump administration from rethinking these arrangements. They would not
have time to do that, as Ukraine would immediately need more money and
weapons. The assumption was that they would have no choice but to go
along with more money and weapons, thus entangling Trump in the Ukraine
trap.

The underlying assumption was that Trump would not walk away from
Project Ukraine and risk the image of Russian tanks rumbling through
Kiev. This is the assumption the Europeans and Zelensky are relying on
as they deal with Trump. In fact, Zelensky is so confident of this that
he is going out of his way to jerk around the Trump administration on
the mineral rights deal. Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer are coming to
Washington this week to set Trump straight.

Reportedly, Starmer and Macron will present a plan to Trump that has the
UK and France putting troops into Ukraine, while the United States
provides air cover from bases in Poland and Romania. In effect, the
United States must create a no-fly zone over Ukraine and go to war with
Russia if the Russians violate it. The madness of the scheme is so
beyond the pale it is hard to accept as real, but the Europeans are
operating in an alternative reality from the rest of us.

The Trump people see that the main obstacle to their plans for
normalizing relations with Russia is Zelensky. Anyone who has dealt with
a deadbeat knows Zelensky and the best way of dealing with this type is
to get rid of them. Elections will remove him from the picture. The end
of American support will also remove him from the picture, as the only
reason for him to exist is as a facilitator of money and arms into
Ukraine, mostly the money, which is stolen by Ukrainian officials.

The danger of pulling the plug on Ukraine is that it could be bad public
relations, which is where the mineral rights dispute comes into play.
The point of this is to make it appear as if Zelensky is unwilling to
make a deal for more money and make it look like he is the obstacle to a
peace deal. Trump’s team has figured out that Zelensky cannot sign the
mineral deal, and he cannot agree to negotiations, so they are pressing
on both in order to shift the blame to him.

What is setting up is a game of chicken. On one side we have Zelensky
and the Europeans, who are sure Trump will never walk away from Ukraine.
It is why they are getting bolder in their demands. They think Trump is
bluffing. On the other side we have Team Trump who is sure the Europeans
will fall in line, rather than risk a break with Washington, even if it
means abandoning Ukraine. Zelensky is sure he has fooled everyone with
his latest schemes.

For their part, the Russians are making the prudent bet. It costs them
nothing to talk with the Trump administration and there is a good chance
it leads to a positive outcome, so they will follow that route to the
end. Similarly, the Chinese have made positive noises about the start of
talks between Moscow and Washington. Like the Russians, the Chinese
welcome the return of normalcy to Washington. China and Russia are open
for business and ready to make deals.

It is too soon to know how this ends, but this game of chicken revolves
around Zelensky being the ruler of Ukraine, which means the way to avoid
a collision is to remove him from the equation. The Russians figured
this out two years ago. The Chinese figured it out last year when they
had talks with him. Now the Trump administration has arrived at the same
conclusion. That leaves the Europeans and the bet in the White House
right now is they will choose Washington over Zelensky.
