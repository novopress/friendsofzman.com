The great fear as the internet spread across American society was that
things in this virtual world would somehow cross over into the real
world. Usually this meant that the machines would get super intelligent
and take over society. This is the underlying theme of movies like *The
Terminator*. Alternatively, a being from inside the internet would make
the jump into the meat space. This is the plot for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuosity" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">film</a> *Virtuosity*. A virtual serial killer gets
loose in the real world and does his worst.

Nothing like that has come to pass, but something worse may be happening
and that is reality is being sucked into the virtual world. More
accurately, people are spending so much time online that the virtual
world is supplanting reality for them. We are seeing this with the
Harris campaign, which is probably the most intensely online political
program we have every experienced. Everything about it is based on
winning the internet that day, which means it operates by the rules of
the internet.

The most obvious example is how the Kamala Harris character has been
reimagined by her developers into something disconnected from reality.
From the presentation, one would never know she has been Vice President
for the last four years or that she has spent those years arguing for
the administration’s positions. Like a discarded scene from a video
game, all of that is gone now. In its place is the new character whose
only connection to the prior character is the name.

The disconnectedness extends to her campaign and its supporters. Trump
has been stumping on the idea of exempting tips from income taxes.
Whatever the merits of the idea, it is a clever way to appeal to young
people. The other day, the Harris character announced its plan to not
tax tips, as if it were something totally new that had never been
mentioned by anyone. Miraculously, the people playing the Harris
character online responded as if it was a total novel idea.

Of course, this being the age of mendacity, the new Harris gameplay
comes with manufactured crowds online that cheer for it. There are fake
polls that claim this character is now the most popular character in the
game. It is destroying all of the orange baddies in this expansion pack.
We know this because every day the lie machine we call mass media fills
the game space with stories about how Trump is raging in his bunker
about the greatness of the Harris character.

This upgraded version of Kamala Harris is now equipment with a lacky to
do the things lackies do for the hero. Like the new Kamala Harris, the
character called Tim Walz bears little resemblance to the old version.
Instead of being a bloviating windbag who bores people with his
imaginary tales of heroism in the military, this version is a folksy
good old boy who just happens to hold all of the same opinions as the
developers who created his character for the game.

What we are experiencing right now is a political campaign that exists
only in the virtual world of the highly online. If you are not playing
in this part of the game or you live in reality, you may not know about
any of this. Maybe one of your favorite “influencers” has gone into
panic mode for some reason and that got your attention. Otherwise, if
you are not in this part of the game, none of this is real to you. The
main reason for that is that nothing about this campaign is real thus
far.

This is why the people most affected by this new release are the
self-styled influencers who live entirely online. These people spend all
day, every day, looking for something they can front-run in order to
maintain the illusion that they are not just playing the game, but they
are controlling it. The reason they are called influencers is not that
they influence anyone, but that they are the most easily influenced. The
right-wing influencer
<a href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1822387943044174010"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowd</a> cannot stop playing the new
Harris character.

The highly online, of course, will argue that this is reality, and it is
now changing the meat space, but how would they know? One of the weird
aspects of virtual reality is that it is self-affirming to the people
who have been sucked into it. For many of them, Twitter is reality and
people outside of it do not exist. This is why influencers banned from
Twitter were so desperate to get back on the platform. Having your
account suspended is what passes for Hell in the virtual world.

That still leaves the question as to whether this is working. More
people get their news from online sources than from legacy sources, so
if you win the internet then it suggests you can influence people. On
the other hand, the internet is a big place and people gravitate to that
which confirms the opinions. One reason the undecided voter is a thing
of the past is everyone now has an online tribe. Alternatively, they
have a cable chat show they watch every night for their opinions.

The highly online like saying that arguing with a boomer is arguing with
the television because all of their opinions come from television.
Ironically, arguing with the highly online is arguing with the internet.
The people playing the Nick Fuentes character right now have no ideas of
their own. They have the ideas of the other players in the Nick Fuentes
game space. It turns out that right-wing zoomers are just like the
right-wing boomers they criticize. They just have a different god.

That is what will be the interesting thing about the Harris game.
Eventually, the Harris character will have to step outside the curated
world of gameplay and talk to flesh and blood humans, as well as debate
Trump. As much as the developers would like to believe the reality they
have created has supplanted the old reality, the test of this will be
their character leaving the game space for the meat space. The same
holds for the lackey with his Elmer Fudd costume and reimagined
backstory.

What it will ultimately come down to is whether the voters will prefer
the game space reality to the meat space reality. Will they believe the
upgraded Harris character is preferable to the meat space Harris and
continue to play the game character as a form of escapism or will they
experience the meat space version and get turned off by the game itself?
That is the central question of this election. This is the first
election where people are asked to choose reality versus escapism.
