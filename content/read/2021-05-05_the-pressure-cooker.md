A universal truth of life is that pressure reveals character. This is
not only true in individuals, but it is also true in societies. When
times are easy, all sorts of undesirable things can be overlooked. The
petty corruption in government is not a big deal in a booming economy.
Inequality is ignored, maybe even celebrated when times are good,
because people think their time will come. It is when things turn down
that all of a sudden, those issues rise up and take up people’s
attention.

For the American economy, the good times have been rolling for such a
long time now that it feels like the natural state of affairs. There was
the very minor recession in the early 1990’s, but that was a blip. The
dot-com bust at the end of the 1990’s and the mortgage crisis in 2008
were serious, but they did not impact most people. The stock markets
went down, but they recovered. Some people suffered for sure, but the
system seemed to right itself and for most people it was a non-event.

In fact, the two big economic crises of the last forty years are a proof
that the system and the people running are just fine. This was why many
middle-class people were angry at the lock downs initially. They thought
it would harm the economy. When the Fed flew in on its magic carpet,
showering the economy with magic fairy dust, those people relaxed and
trusted the system. Those initial protests that popped up all around the
country faded away in a fog of economic stimulus.

Good times do not last forever, even in an honest economy. The signs are
everywhere now that this economy is headed for some tough times. Food
prices are jumping like we have not seen since the 1970’s. There are
strange shortages of products like beer and plastic goods. There is
plenty of beer. The issue is the containers. Aluminum shortages and
problems in the supply chain mean certain brands are not on the shelf.
This leads to greater sales of other brands until they run low.

Inflation is one of those things that everyone feels. Even if you are a
rich guy, you notice that steak is more expensive. The money is
meaningless to you, but the price hike does not go unnoticed. Poor
people, of course, feel it straight away. As a result, everyone starts
to notice things in the market, like the shrinkflation, for example. A
pint of ice cream is 14-ounces now. The potato chip bag is much larger,
but there are fewer chips inside the bag. This stuff gets more obvious
in bad times.

The thing is, prices going up because of demand or shortages is an
honest result that people may not like, but they can accept. Changing
the shape of containers to make it look bigger, but reducing the
contents is dishonest. It is a fraud. Inflation will bring new scrutiny
to this practice that has become common. This sort of institutional
fraud is everywhere, but it has gone unnoticed for decades. With
inflation, people will start noticing and they will not like it.

The institutional fraud is not just a retail phenomenon. It is
everywhere. The hot new scam on Wall Street is the SPAC. This is where a
company wants to go public, but their financials are not good enough for
an IPO. A group of insiders then creates a shell company for the purpose
of making acquisitions. It raises a bunch of money, then it goes public
and soon after buys the company that wished to go public. It is how we
end up with [$100m sandwich shops](https://archive.is/hJ8Q5) in New
Jersey.

Of course, the elephant in the room for close to a generation now is the
gross inequality we see in modern America. The gap between the rich and
the middle has never been larger, and it is growing quickly. Unlike the
robber barons of the industrial age, these new oligarchs operate like
pirates. They steal everything. Worse yet, they have unleashed a
well-funded army of radical harpies to hound decent people in their
work, their entertainments, and their private lives.

In good times, no one cares about billionaires. If your life is good and
getting better, why should you care if some other guy is doing better?
That flips around quickly when your life is suddenly under economic
strain. The Democrats can yack about taxing the rich and the Republicans
can lecture about class envy, but class consciousness is always a result
of tough economic times. Everyone starts feeling working class in bad
times, even when they are well-equipped to weather the storm.

The point is a lot of bad things have crept into the system over the
last forty years of relatively stable times. As long as material
concerns were met, people overlooked the fraud, the corruption, and the
inequality. That long run of good times has meant the stock of these
things is higher than ever. When bad times come, those problems will
come roaring to the front of people’s minds. In other words, the sticker
shock we are experiencing can quickly give way to a culture shock.

There is one other item to consider. The middle-class is older than
ever. Those Baby Boomers on fixed incomes, checking the stock market
every day are not going to take inflation very well. They will not
handle the necessary correction in the stock market to ring out the
fraud. Inflation and what is required to tame it will bring with it the
wrath of the angry Boomer. The generational divide that has been nursed
by the usual suspects will suddenly get very real if the economy goes
south this summer.

Similarly, the political class is old now too. Will those angry Boomers
passively accept the leadership of Joe Biden in a crisis? Can a
generation of politicians selected for their mendacity and
obsequiousness gain the trust of the public in a crisis? If the economy
tanks this summer, the incompetence and corruption in Washington will
become the only thing that matters in politics. In other words, bad
times will bring all of these problems to the front in a time of
dwindling tolerance for it.

The American empire is old now and that means a lot of bad habits have
been normalized over the years. Shrinkflation, SPACs, media mendacity,
inequality and political corruption are all troublesome alone. Over the
decades, we have an abundance of all of them. They remain in the
background as long as the markets are up, and we have cheap goods on the
shelves. The pressure of bad times, however, will inevitably reveal the
character of the empire. It will not end well.
