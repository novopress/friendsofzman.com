**Note:** Tonight at 8:00 EDT, Paul and I will be talking about what it
means to be a dissident in this age. The show is on Twitter, YouTube and
Rumble.

A strange thing developing in pseudo-intellectual circles is the defense
of expertise, by which is meant the defense of credentialism. People
long on credentials, but short on practical knowledge and experience,
are demanding they get the respect they deserve as experts in their
respective fields. Nathan Cofnas is the latest to get in on the issue by
demanding we respect his authority as an expert. Dick Hanania has also
used to the issue to get attention online.

It is not a new issue nor one exclusive to the sorts of people who seek
attention online as “influencers.” Credentialism produces a class of
people who have no practical knowledge, so they have no experience. The
lack of experience means they have no tangible results to back up their
claims to expertise. This produces a class of people who defend
credentialed experts. The anti-Trump crank Tom Nichols is a good example
of the type. He even wrote a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Expertise"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> defending credentialed experts.

Credentialism itself is a sign the system has entered its denouement. It
signals the capture of the system by people who are motivated by class
consciousness rather than a genuine expertise in a specific field. The
group of people devoted to genuine expertise are shouldered aside by
those devoted to defending the privileges that come from claiming
expertise. To solidify their hold, they create arbitrary barriers of
entry into the domain of expertise, which are called credentials.

This is the flaw in Peter Turchin’s concept of elite overproduction, at
least as far as it applies to the managerial state. It is not that there
are too many elites for the available positions, but that the nature of
elite degrades over time. The builders give way to maintainers who are
then displaced at the top by people who are good at institutional
politics, to the exclusion of practical knowledge. The definition of
elite then changes from practical things to the abstractions we see
within credentialism.

That aside, for those interested in seeing how the defense of
credentialism manifests with the next generations, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/4JCq-wlOg88?si=P7OazRsqwsjx-tns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> is a good start. Dave Greene,
the man behind the YouTube channel The Distributist, debated Nathan
Cofnas, the person who gained some notoriety attacking Kevin MacDonald a
half dozen years ago. Cofnas is now trying to create a new career
defending credentialism. Cofnas then
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8J2iwEF2rlI?si=O_zOvjj3wVeOMD37"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">defended</a> his performance with former
pornographer Luke Ford.

Without knowing it, at least as a front brain process, Cofnas is
engaging in a group activity in his defense of credentialism. He is
appealing to the people who may or may not allow him to remain in the
expert class. He is not trying to convince the rubes to respect his
authority. He is signaling to his betters that he is a reliable
candidate for admission into the club. His thumbless way of doing it is
his undoing, but it the behavior elicited by the selection mechanisms of
credentialism.

A more nuanced example is this <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/us-sanctions-threaten-europes-russian-gas-lifeline"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on Zero Hedge about the plan
circulating in the West to cut themselves off from cheap energy
products. The origin of the post is the <a
href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/US-Sanctions-Threaten-Europes-Russian-Gas-Lifeline.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">site</a> OilPrice.com, which is a
clearing house of postings about the energy markets. The author of the
post is someone calling himself Cyril Widdershoven. That is not a fake
internet name, but a real person. Here is his CV on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrilwiddershoven/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. He is an anthropomorphized example of
credentialism.

If you read the
<a href="https://oilprice.com/contributors/Cyril-Widdershoven"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">postings</a> of Cyril Widdershoven at
that site, what you see is that he is usually wrong in his predictions.
His analysis in the case of the pending energy sanctions rests not on an
understanding of oil markets but on an understanding of the prevailing
opinions in the expert class. That is the key to his wrongness. He is
always wrong in the same way everyone else in the expert class is wrong.
In managerialism, being wrong along with everyone else is better than
being right.

That is the thing about credentialism. It selects for people who
preternaturally understand the prevailing attitudes within the group. It
is why the range of opinions is so narrow in every field. Once any group
hits a critical mass of people whose instinct is to be in the center of
the group, the group is then defined by the fights to be as close to the
center as possible. The expert class becomes a collapsing star. This is
why our expert class now sounds like a chorus rather than a debate.

You see the problem in that video of Cofnas debating Greene. Cofnas
cannot distinguish between error and a lie or understand why one is
better than the other because for him they are not moral issues. Both
are simply means to an end, much in the way a sociopath views the truth
and a lie. In the case of credentialism, error and lying only matter
insofar as they move you closer to the center. The practical impact is
of no importance to the people inside the expert class.

Managerialism, of which the expert class is a part, rests on the social
capital of the people over whom it rules. The accumulating errors of the
expert class, which contributes to the dysfunction of the managerial
system, is eroding the social capital of society and thus we see the
collapsing trust in experts and the state. Counterintuitively this is
seen as proof within the expert class that they are not just experts,
but members of the elect, chosen to rule over the non-experts.

This explains the prevailing madness in our politics. The motivations
inside the system are now divorced from practical necessity. The rooms
where decisions are made are full of people with resumes littered with
the word “consultant” or letters indicating admission to various
subgroups in the expert class. Nowhere is there anyone who knows how
anything works. The only thing they know for sure is that you should
respect their authority as experts.
