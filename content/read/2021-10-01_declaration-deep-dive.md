The Declaration of Independence is one of the most influential documents
in human history, right up there with the Magna Carta and the Communist
Manifesto. The main reason for this is it stands as the mission
statement of the American empire, so its influence is imposed on the
world. The same can probably be said for the Magna Carta, which we know
about because of the British Empire and by extension, the Anglosphere
which dominates the modern world.

The power of the Declaration lies in the opening sentence of the second
paragraph, which is the legitimizing authority for the American empire.
If an action or position can be couched in terms of equality or the
defense of unalienable rights, it is justified. It is one of the
deadliest sentences ever written, right up there with Rousseau’s “Beware
of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that
the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to
nobody.”

Despite the massive abuse that has flowed from that unfortunate bit of
rhetorical flourish, the document itself is an amazing expression of
European political morality that should be at the center of dissident
thought. Within it lies the moral framework that binds a people to their
ruler, but also the moral imperative of breaking that bond when the
ruler is corrupt or tyrannical. In this age of liberal tyranny, it is a
highly useful starting point for the moral opposition to liberal
democracy.

A central question of this age is can you have a peaceful and prosperous
society without a well-defined people? If the answer is no, which surely
seems to be the case, then the obvious question is can a people exist
without a ruler committed to the preservation of the people? In this
age, the rulers are committed to abdicating their responsibilities to
the people on the grounds that there is no such thing as a people, at
least there is no such thing as *our* people.

Since self-preservation is the primary duty of all life, the first duty
of a human group with a common identity is the preservation of the
group. Logically, a ruler that violates his duty to that prime
directive, putting the very existence of the people into question, is a
lethal threat to the people. Just as it is the duty of a life forms to
do what they must to preserve their existence, it follows that it is the
duty of a people to use any means necessary to preserve itself. It is
self-evident.

The real value in the Declaration today is in its radicalism. In the
18th century the claim that a ruler has a duty to his people was not
radical. It was assumed. The claim of natural rights could be viewed as
radical for the age, but these ideas were in wide circulation at the
time. Today, however they are radical. In fact, we are rapidly
approaching a point where uttering these ideas in public will lead
agents of the state to put you on a secret list. We are in a dark age
now.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
