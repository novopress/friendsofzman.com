When the Vikings sacked the monastery at Lindisfarne, the Anglo-Saxons,
trying to figure out what happened, came to the only logical conclusion.
God was angry with them over something did or did not do.

*“In this year fierce, foreboding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omens" class="mw-redirect"
title="Omens">omens</a> came over the land of the Northumbrians, and the
wretched people shook; there were excessive whirlwinds, lightning, and
fiery
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons" class="mw-redirect"
title="Dragons">dragons</a> were seen flying in the sky. These signs
were followed by great famine, and a little after those, that same year
on 6th ides of January, the ravaging of wretched heathen people
destroyed God’s church at Lindisfarne.”*

*–The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*

What followed in Britain as well as the rest of Christendom was more
than just a military response to the Vikings. There was a spiritual
revival. The secular authorities contributed to the Church and invited
the bishops and priests into the granular management of society. The
Church reformed religious orders and cleaned up the monasteries and
nunneries. The role of women in religious orders was also diminished at
this time. In other words, Europeans responded to a pagan assault by
getting right with the Almighty.

Oliver Cromwell was pretty sure he was in God’s good graces. After all,
he went from minor political figure to the head of the parliamentary
army to the Lord Protector of God’s people, the English. After the
disastrous military expedition into the Caribbean and a Royalist revolt,
Cromwell came to the obvious conclusion. God was not happy with him and
the English people. He set off on a campaign to restore liberty of
conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout
England.

In the early 19th century, Abolitionists were sure that slavery was an
offense to God and its presence in the new world would bring an end to
the America Experiment. The people of Yankee New England were convinced
that America was the city on the hill, the savior of mankind. They still
believe this. The lyrics to the Battle Hymn of the Republic make this
quite clear.

*Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;*  
*He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
stored;*  
*He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift
sword: <span class="mw-poem-indented">His truth is marching on.</span>*

*I have read a fiery
[gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel "Gospel") writ in
burnished rows of steel:*  
*“As ye deal with my
[contemners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt "Contempt"), so with
you my grace shall deal”;*  
*Let the Hero, born of woman, crush
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(Bible)"

heel, <span class="mw-poem-indented">Since God is marching on.</span>*

The winning side of the Civil War blames the war on the siege of Fort
Sumter by the evil white men of the evil South. The truth is the
Abolitionist fanatics were spoiling for a fight. They truly believed
that slavery was an offense to God and the only way to get back in the
good graces of the Almighty was to end it by any means necessary.
American Abolitionists grew out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham_Sect" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Clapham Sect</a>, a group of evangelical Anglican
lunatics.

We are now fully in the post-Christian era so the schools no longer
teach kids the religious origins of the present lunacies. Instead, an
array of bogeymen and evil spirits are conjured as replacements. Blacks
are where they are, despite three generations of Progressive programs to
help them, because of the mysterious demon called “white privilege.” No
one can describe how this works, but our betters are sure this demon
travels in the book bags of college students.

Sometimes bad juju is the cause of trouble as we see in <a
href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/an-unfair-tragedy-for-unlucky-dallas-214033"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this article about the George Soros
funded attack on Dallas cops</a>.

*When the shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in 1963, their reports
ricocheted off the tall buildings surrounding the green park. One bullet
caught <a
href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/11/21/accidental-victim-in-jfk-assassination-recalls-shooting.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">an innocent bystander</a>. One found the
governor of Texas. <a
href="http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1a.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Two more, of course</a>, struck and
killed President John F. Kennedy, and in those few seconds frozen in
time, the city of Dallas was instantly branded: the City of Hate.*

*A little more than 50 years later, the shots have rung out in downtown
Dallas again, just a short stroll from infamous Dealey Plaza. There are
some eerie circumstantial similarities, to be sure. But this time the
target was not a president—it was police officers. And the political
obsession of the moment was no longer the Cold War but racial division,
the remaining scar of America’s greatest sin: slavery.*

Notice the residual language. Sin is a Christian concept so if there is
no Christian God, there can be no sin. That’s too complicated for the
modern lunatic so they appropriate the language of their spiritual
forebears, without thinking much about the implications. In this case,
the modern lunatic thinks we have not fully atoned to the
invisible forces of nature, for the sin of slavery, so we are having
another spasm of black rage. How one can get right with the Great Spirit
is never explained, but it means punishing the bad whites for some
reason.

The modern era is riddled with these sorts of bogeymen and evil spirits.
The Southern Poverty Law Center exists for the sole purpose of scaring
old Jewish widows with stories about Hitler. Adolph is no longer a flesh
and blood historical figure. He is a permanent spirit-force that takes
the form of man, usually a Republican politician. Similarly, the KKK has
become the Eye of Sauron, watching every dusky fellow in the country. If
a brotha is not on his toes, a cop will pop out of thin air and shoot
him for no reason.

Our current ructions are over who is to blame for angering the Bogeyman.
