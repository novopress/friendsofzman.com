A topic that will come up here regularly is that the American Right has
never understood the nature of the American Left. In fact, using the
terms Left and Right in the political context is a category error. The
American Left is nothing like the European Left . It is a radical
religion that seeks salvation by purifying the community of heretics.
That’s why they are immune to facts and reason. There’s not talking a
fanatic out of his fanaticism, anymore than you can talk a Muslim out of
his religion. <a

There you have it, The President, in the face of all those facts and
arguments still embraces radical Islam, so he must be crazy. What passes
for the Right in America is trapped in this mode of thought that says
the Left is rational, so if they embrace rationality, it’s not their
liberalism, but some mental disease or possible diabolical plot that has
yet to be revealed. In other words, Simon simply rules out the
possibility that Obama believes what he says and is motivated by a moral
framework that structures these beliefs.

The Left in America is a religion. They have decorated their religion
over the years with stuff from Continental radicalism and, of course,
Jewish radicalism, which is the source of the rabid
anti-nationalism. That was the lesson from the two last wars, allegedly,
was that nationalism, German nationalism specifically, but nationalism
in general, is the source of war on the continent. The American Left
imported that idea in the 1960’s, first as anti-colonialism and now as a
hostility to the very basics of citizenship and country.

Obama is a prime example. Every normal person has a copy of their birth
certificate out of necessity. They have a social security number issued
in their youth that they used for an ID number since kindergarten.  They
know their religion, even if they never have attended church. Of course,
they know the place and circumstances of their birth. Obama has none of
those things. He has never seen a reason to have them. He is a citizen
of the world and his identity has nothing to do with his nation of
origin. His tribe is his class and status.

It is why Obama struggles so much with odd subjects like how many states
there are in America. He has said Hawaii is in Asia. He has mistakenly
said he is a Muslim. These are not things that have been important to
him. He was raised to eschew these proletarian interests. To American
liberals like Obama, the idea of a nation and a national people is as
outdated as the buggy whip. He sees himself as a holy man, whose task
is is to usher in the age when there are no borders and no national
governments.

Therefore, when he looks at the anarchy and chaos of Egypt, he does not
see the things Simon thinks are important. He sees people he generally
admires, engaged in the same task in which he is enraged. Islamist dream
of world after the fall of countries. Their vision of the future is not
a lot different from some Italian fascists, who imagined their political
cause was linked with the restoration of the Catholic Church in Europe.
For the Islamist, “Egypt” is an outmoded concept, so toppling it over is
a service to their cause.

For dilettante like Obama, and he is fairly representative of the modern
Left in that regard, he has not thought much about what comes next. The
post-national paradise is just going to be better. Further, his innate
hatred of white people and what he imagines as white culture, motivates
him to oppose those things he associates with the West. For Obama and
the modern Left, the glorious future is something like a college campus
run by women and non-whites, with white males on the lowest rung of the
social ladder.

The point here is that there is no reasoning with these people. That’s
where guys like Roger Simon slam into a brick wall. He simply cannot
accept that Progressivism is free of rationality. it is a secular
religion that is esoteric and mystical, especially to the adherents, who
are drawn to it out of self-loathing. Marx allegedly said religion was
the opium of the masses. Progressivism is the methamphetamine of the
American ruling class. The more they use it, the less rational they
become and their craving for the drug only grows.
