One of the most underdiscussed parts of the current crisis is the war
being waged against the infectious disease known as neoconservatism. It
started in 2015 when Trump launched his bid for president. Even though
he was never able to articulate it, he was running as a rejection of
Bush and by extension the neocons. It was his win in the South Carolina
primary, after he had unloaded on George Bush, which sent the neocons
into a panic and started the Republican civil war.

It has been an interesting civil war in that it was mostly the party
against Trump but it has turned into an old versus new since he left
office. He had some allies in the party, for sure, but most were too
afraid to be open about it. Some, like Lindsey Graham, pretended to be
his ally so they could hell subvert his presidency, especially on the
foreign policy front. Graham was sent in from the usual suspects to keep
Trump in line on those issues.

Even so, there has been a slow realignment going in within the party as
well as within what is left of the conservative movement. On the later
front, the neocons have completely shed their skin and joined the Left.
Bill Kristol runs something called the Bulwark, which no one reads. His
other efforts are aimed at
<a href="https://accountability.gop/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">undermining</a> his former party through the Republican
Accountability Project. They used to be Republicans Against Trump, but
that was too obvious.

Jonah Goldberg and Steve Hayes were both fired from Fox News for a lack
of interest by the viewers. Hayes ran The Weekly Standard into the
ground and now he runs something called the Dispatch. His partner in
that is Jonah Goldberg, who was also jettisoned from National Review. Of
course, they brought on the soy-faced wojack David French, who has stop
pretending to be a Christian and instead has embraced the religion of
post-Marx identity politics.

The return of the neocons back to their ideological home on the Left has
left a void in what is left of conservatism. For two generations they
were a golem for neoconservatism, despite their pretensions. Without
their animators, they have been left to stagger around without purpose.
There is a long
[debate](https://newcriterion.com/issues/2022/1/the-fallacies-of-the-common-good)
among establishment intellectuals about what can replace it or reform
it. Most likely, it is just pushed over the side in favor of something
new and organic.

The crisis in the system is showing up in the primaries. The [donor
class](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/04/11/scoop-liz-cheneys-record-fundraising-haul-00024356)
is pouring cash into the Wyoming congressional primary. The neocons are
rallying their supporters among the plutocrats in an effort to undermine
the party. The effort in Wyoming is based on getting registered
Democrats to cross over and vote in the Republican primary on election
day. In other words, Liz Cheney is just a cat’s paw for the Trotskyist
murder cult that has decamped for the other party.

Probably the most interesting race thus far is in Ohio, where you have
three flavors of populists running for the open Senate seat. There is an
old boomer running as if it is 1985 but he is rich and has party
support. There is Josh Mandel, who will quickly morph into Lindsey
Graham if elected. Then there is J.D. Vance, who is trying to run as a
post-Trump populist. It is a three-way race at the moment and it
reflects the currents within the Republican Party.

Gibbons will probably win the primary mostly because old white people
will never come to terms with current realty. Instead, they will cling
to the civic nationalist fantasy of voting our way out of the problems
of democracy. The fact that just as many are easily fooled by Mandel
hammers home this point. Both are creatures of the legacy talk radio
culture. Only the [actuarial
tables](https://www.takimag.com/article/one-funeral-at-a-time/) will fix
this problem within the Republican electorate.

The fact that J.D. Vance is in the conversation says that some people
are waking up to the reality they face as a people. Vance is not a
charismatic politician and there are genuine concerns about his
sincerity. He was a Trump-hater back in 2016 so people should be wary of
his judgement. Then again, he is not unusual in that many people have
gone through a similar conversion. Vance often sounds like a guy who
suddenly realized he had been lied to his whole life.

None of this is to suggest that the Republican Party is about to become
representative of the people who vote for it. That will never be
allowed. The point of the party is to make sure the majority population
has no representation in government. If that arrangement is threatened,
then it is mail-in voting for every state. It is just increasingly
difficult to keep the old grift going. The old Red Team versus Blue Team
dynamic is collapsing.

We are at the start of a volatile period in politics. The great tide of
discontent that will sweep the primaries this autumn will bring in all
sorts of people. The war between the ruling class and the people will
shift to Washington, where there will be more than a few Marjorie Taylor
Greene types roaming the halls of Congress. The main result will be the
final purge of the neocons from the Republican side. The process that
began in the 1960’s is about to come full circle.
