The American Conservative Union (CPAC) and America First (AFPAC) had
their big annual events this weekend in Orlando Florida. Both were moved
from Washington to Florida because of the Covid panic. Both are
struggling to get their footing now that Trump has left office, so it
makes sense for both groups to hold their event in the former
president’s home state. That and Florida has become the last bastion of
rational, conservative government, where the people remain free.

The interesting juxtaposition is that both events claim to be speaking
for the future of the American Right. CPAC is trying to appropriate
populism and make it palatable for the oligarchs. AFPAC is trying to
turn over-the-top support for Trump into a youth movement that will
attract oligarch support. Both sides have made clear that the other side
is not on their side. One side is the old established brand with market
dominance, while the other brand is the upstart trying to make a splash.

Another point of comparison worth mentioning is that AFPAC managed to
pull of their event in the teeth of institutional opposition. Given the
climate, no one would have faulted Nick Fuentes for cancelling the show.
He not only went forward with it, but he also pulled off the biggest
dissident event ever staged. To get hundreds of people in and out of a
semi-secret event, attended by sitting Congressmen and political
celebrities, without a hitch is a stunning achievement by Fuentes and
his crew.

On the other side of things, CPAC was lightly attended compared to years
past, in part because of the location change. Conservative Inc. is a
creature of Washington and CPAC is like their annual awards show.
Holding CPAC in Orlando is like holding the Oscars in Iowa. There is
also the fact that CPAC is a legacy brand and legacy brands are out of
favor on the Right. Two generations of failure have most right-wing
people looking for something better than the same old offerings.

The two visions of the future of the right are interesting in that
neither is all that clear about where they are going. CPAC is clearly
scrambling to protect their brand by allowing some populists back into
their “big tent.” It is easy to forget that they ran off the Buchanan
Brigades back in the bad old days. For a long time, CPAC was about
making sure Trump’s brand of politics never got a purchase in the
Republican Party. Events have forced them to be nice to people they
generally despise.

On the other hand, Fuentes is starting from a paleoconservative base. He
has often described himself as a paleocon. His movement has been carried
forward by the blustery thermals of the Trump phenomenon. Like the Trump
phenomenon, the goals are not all that clear. Right now, Fuentes and his
imitators on live streaming platforms are speaking to issues important
to young white men. In is a genuinely populist and right-wing
phenomenon, in that it is entirely reactionary.

The trouble for both sides is they are like farmers who have been
suffering through a long drought. It had been so long since they felt
the rain, they were not prepared for when the heavens would open and
saturate the earth. Suddenly, political actors find themselves
surrounded by fertile soil. In the case of the old guard, it means
learning how to be farmers again. In the case of the new guard, it is
coming to terms with the fact they have never been farmers.

Another problem for both sides is they lack a language geared toward the
future, so they rely on the language of the past. The civic nationalist
stuff from CPAC appeals to old people, but it has no answers for what is
happening nor for what is coming as America becomes majority-minority.
They cannot even bring themselves to oppose immigration, which would at
least acknowledge reality. CPAC is, at best, a bit of escapism for
people who have no future.

AFPAC, on the other hand, gets that demographics are changing, but there
is still that hope it can all be fixed. The name of their movement gives
it away. Putting America first only makes sense when you can define
America. Granted, there is a fair bit of rhetorical sleight of hand
here, in order to dodge the censors, but at some point, they must
confront the fact that America looks nothing like America. What comes
next will look nothing like what is in our history books.

What matters most, of course, is that CPAC is the past and AFPAC or
something like it is the future. Nick Fuentes managed to do what the
alt-right could never muster and that is create a legitimate political
movement. Unlike the various goofballs that populated the alt-right
leadership, Fuentes has proven himself to be an effective organizer and
a highly effective leader. He is arguably the most talented figure to
come from the populist uprising that was kicked off by the Trump
presidential run.
