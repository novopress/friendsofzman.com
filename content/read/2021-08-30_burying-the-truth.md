**Note:** The weekly
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-freedom-to-be-left-alone/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is up at Taki. This week is a
cranky rant about wanting to be left alone in a world full of
busybodies.

with some other things.

Inside the microwave oven there is a microwave generator, which takes
electricity and converts it into high-powered radio waves. The magnetron
blasts these waves into the food compartment. The microwaves bounce back
and forth off the reflective metal walls of the box, just like light
bounces off a mirror. As these waves travel through the food item, they
make the molecules inside it vibrate more quickly, which generates heat
and that is what causes the food to get hot.

It is not only a brilliant way to quickly heat food in the home, but it
is also a good way to think about what is happening inside modern
America. Instead of a magnetron generating microwaves, we have the mass
media which generates lies, fabrications, and propaganda. These waves of
false information bounce around within society causing people to act.
Since these waves of data are at odds with reality, this causes friction
within society and the people inside get increasingly agitated.

As an example, consider [this
story](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/notre-dame-defends-leprechaun-mascot-after-it-was-voted-fourth-most-offensive-in-college-football-survey/)
in the sporting press about mascots. The claim is that a survey was
conducted and the Notre Dame mascot, an exaggerated leprechaun, is the
fourth most offensive mascot in college sports. The top three most
offensive mascots were from Florida State, San Diego State and Hawaii.
According to the story, these mascots are offensive to Native Americans.
The survey was conducted by a company calling itself Quality Logo
Products.

For starters, the whole thing is based on the lie that it is possible to
be offended by a team mascot. This is a lie created in the last half
century. For ten thousand years of human history, no one thought to be
offended by such things. In fact, no one looked for a reason to be
offended. Personal offense required intent. The person causing the
offense was either trying to insult someone or was reckless in their
opinions so as to cause an offense to social norms.

Putting that aside, what are the odds that this company, which sells
marketing materials, actually conducted such a survey? What are the odds
that anyone knows the name of the San Diego State mascot? Most American
sports fans would know the Notre Dame mascot, as their football team is
nationally famous. Few people probably know there is a college called
San Diego State. The same can be said of Hawaii. In other words, the
survey is completely fake.

The way these things work is the company probably thought this was a
good way to get attention for their services. If you beam some lies into
the college sports oven, you will get some of the fans agitated. In this
case, the mass media is the mirror reflecting this stream of nonsense
back to the intended target. Other
[media](https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/30/after-fighting-irish-fans-reject-poll-claiming-their-mascot-is-offensive-poll-results-disappear/)
picked up the original “story” and beamed that back onto the target. In
this way, a deliberate lie is turned into another social irritant,
agitating the public.

Joseph de Maistre said, “False opinions are like false money, struck
first of all by guilty men and thereafter circulated by honest people
who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they are doing.” This is
the modern age, accept that most opinion is false, and it is produced on
an industrial scale. The people are assaulted by a constant stream of
lies and falsehoods that comes from all directions. Even the escapism of
sports entertainment is weaponized against them.

Some people sense that they are in a sea of contemptuous disregard for
truth and unplug as best they can from the system. They don’t consume
television and avoid what passes for mass culture. The person who does
this chooses to live outside of society, however, so it brings its own
challenges. Still, everyone has experienced the peace of going on
holiday and unplugging from the system. It is like being unchained from
a lunatic for a few days.

Another aspect of this is that the modern age selects for the sort of
person who enjoys trafficking in lies and the madness it creates. This
is a feature of political systems that claim to express the general will
of the people. Communist societies bombard the people with propaganda to
break their spirit. By forcing the people to nod along with the lies,
they force the people to be party to the lie. As Theodore Dalrymple once
said, “A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.”

In liberal democratic societies, this is not a part of the design, but a
byproduct of the conflict central to democracy. That conflict is the
assertion that all opinion is equal and must have equal weight. Equality
is itself a nonsensical term as no two things on this plane of existence
are truly equal. When it comes to humans, it is like comparing
snowflakes, as everyone is slightly different. In order to maintain the
fiction of equality, liberal democracy must paper over reality with
lies.

What starts as a polite fiction soon becomes an obsession for the true
believer, who becomes obsessed with covering the truth of nature. This
creates the demand for people who enjoy lying. At first, the best liars
rise in status, as they serve the interests of the system and the people
atop it. This inverts the natural moral code of the people, rewarding
the falsehood at the expense of daily reality. Quickly, democracy turns
into a madhouse of lies and heated reaction to those lies.

Equality is the great crime against civilization. The evidence of this
crime is reality, which like the corpse from a homicide, is impossible
to hide forever. No matter how hard the perpetrators try to weigh it
down with lies, it keeps turning up. This fact drives the egalitarian
mad as he becomes obsessed with hiding this truth. His madness becomes
the madness of the people over whom he rules, but the reality of the
human condition will not stay hidden. It is an immutable truth of life.
