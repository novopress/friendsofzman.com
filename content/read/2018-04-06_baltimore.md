The week started out as a million frustrations, but then ended like the
first warm day after a rotten winter. First the pistol packing Persian
reminded us of the importance of keeping our skills up by going to the
range once a month. Then the fates handed Sloppy Williamson a little bit
of payback for being a colossal douche. It is a good reminder that there
 is always some good news around the corner.

The funny thing is the best bit of news this week was getting hurled
into the void by the social media police. Not looking at this stuff for
a couple of days has been a real boost to morale. I remember reading
somewhere that Facebook users report being less happy than non-Facebook

This week I have the usual variety of items. Spreaker has the full show.
I am up on Google Play now, so the Android commies can take me along
when out disrespecting the country. I am on iTunes, which means the
Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones. Of course, the
Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never finish. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
