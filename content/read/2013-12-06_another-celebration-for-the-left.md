The death of Nelson Mandela will no doubt result in a sanctimonious
circus for the usual suspects on the Left. These people cannot control
themselves, so even at funerals they put on a show, intended to display
their virtue. That’s how it goes with these things. It is a shame
because Mandela’s death could be one of those moments to think about the
realities of Africa, but the people who deified him really don’t care
about Africa or Africans.

Instead, it will be a week of one-upsmanship on the Left, as they <a
href="http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/nelson-mandela-may-be-the-worlds-greatest-h"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compete with one another</a>
to be the most worshipful of a man who was mostly a failure. Chris
Mathews is a great example. He lives in one of the whitest neighborhood
in America, which happens to be outside of Washington. The
Baltimore-Washington area is close to majority black, so a white-only
town stands out. Yet, Mathews will lecture the rest of us about race.

Mathews is emblematic of the Left’s relationship to blacks. For the
Left, blacks are merely a totem. They are something one worships in the
abstract because it riles the enemies of the Left. At least they think
it does. In the fevered imagination of the Left, *The Man* hates blacks
and is always trying to keep them down. Naturally, *The Man* is always a
cartoonish version of the the WASP elite, rather than a liberal Jewish
guy.

Of course, the Mandela worship has always been about the Left
celebrating itself and this funeral will be another example. They love
Mandela because they backed him against the bad whites, who were on the
wrong side of history. If Mandela had died of a stroke before apartheid
ended, he would have been forgotten. It was never about him or his
cause. It was always about the narrative in which the Left is always
operating.

It is a shame because Mandela really was an extraordinary leader by the
standards of Africa. His coevals on the continent competed with one
another to be the most maniacally murderous and destructive. Idi Amin
was a cannibal, for example. No African country emerged from colonialism
and then prospered, except for two. Rhodesia thrived for a time under
Ian Smith. The other is South Africa, at least until now.

The fact that South Africa did not follow the same path as every other
African state is due to Mandela, in no small part. That’s not to say he
was a saint or even a moral person. It’s just that he was not like the
typical African leader, who runs his country in the same way local drug
lords runs their gang. There was a chance to make the Mandela model the
minimally acceptable in Africa, but that never happened and never will
now.

None of that will get much of an airing this weekend. Instead it will be
the Left congratulating itself for opposing Apartheid and embracing
Mandela. It will also be an excuse to revive their passion for Obama.
You can be sure our African prince will be there talking about himself,
not so subtly reminding the Left why they worshiped him up until last
week. The only thing missing will be a wicker man full of white people
to burn.

No one will dare mention the
<a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/southafrica.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deteriorating conditions in
South Africa</a> as the black majority slip back into their natural
state and set about murdering the white minority. Whatever legacy
Mandela could have had will be forgotten after the Left is done with his
memory this weekend. In a decade, when the white minority is fleeing
South Africa, no one will look back and wonder if it was a good idea to
oppose Apartheid. No one will care.
