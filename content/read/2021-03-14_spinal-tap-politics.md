Fifty years ago, two things were clear to those thinking and talking
about politics at the higher level, what people call meta-politics
today. One was the American Left was intellectually exhausted. It no
longer had anything to offer for the problems facing late industrial age
society, other than partisan sloganeering. On the other hand, the
creative minds were all on the newly formed Right. There you had
creative thinking about the problems of the present and hard thinking
about the future.

Half a century on and it is the Right that is bankrupt. All of the old
theorists that made the political Right dynamic and interesting have
either died or been exiled. What is left of conservatism is a collection
of mediocrities wearing the old cloaks of those who built the platforms
on which they stand. The closest there is to an engaging thinker in
conventional conservatism is Christopher Caldwell. Douglas Murray can be
insightful on occasion, but otherwise, conservatism is an intellectual
desert.

The Left, on the other hand, has descended into a partisan madness. They
no longer even pretend to care about the problems of the age or even
about reality. The American Left is now a weird cargo cult led by senile
oldsters. At the top we have detached and delusional geezers reenacting
what they think were their salad days. Below them are their children and
grandchildren, play acting as if this is the Days of Rage. The Left is
live action role playing for people trapped in the past.

The madness of the Left gets all of the attention, but it is the
intellectual bankruptcy of the Right that should get the attention.
Fifty years ago, when the New Left burst onto the scene and set the
political world ablaze, there was a viable and healthy Right to provide
a firebreak of sorts. The madness of the 60’s and 70’s was followed by
the relatively sober minded 80’s and 90’s. This was due in large part to
the Right having lots of smart people thinking hard about how to set
things in order.

This is not the case today. You see this in the writing of the people
considered to be the bright lights of conservatism. <a
href="https://douthat.substack.com/p/the-implications-of-the-6th-of-january"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is a recent piece</a> from Ross
Douthat about the state of American society. The word “obtuse” was
invented for this sort of post. It is mostly a grab bag of talking
points from cable chat shows. He claims Charlottesville was some sort of
right-wing riot. Then he follows on with all the silly whoppers the Left
has been peddling about the January protests.

At the end of the piece, he lets his slip show by hailing the new
regime’s plans to push through a bunch of nation wrecking polices. It is
the writing of someone with nothing to say but compelled to say
something. The image that emerges is of a confused and frightened man,
unable to think critically about the age and terrified that the mobs may
decide to come for him. It is a pre-emptive struggle session that should
probably be read aloud as he sits on a stool wearing a dunce cap.

Like the Left, the Right has a cargo cult quality to it. <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/three-cheers-for-big-business-corporate-greed-and-immigrants/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This post</a> by Kevin Williamson at
National Review is a good example. It’s the sort of bumper sticker
rhetoric Jack Kemp would have used in the 1980’s. Today, it is as
relevant as leisure suits. More important, it is factually wrong. The
market had zero to do with the vaccine. It was government with its
promises of blanket immunity and billions in credit money. No one this
stupid should be allowed to own a pencil, much less write for the
public.

Even fifty years ago, you could cherry pick columns from conservatives
that were stupid and ridiculous, but they were exceptions. Williamson
and Douthat are considered intellectuals of the movement. These are the
guys standing where Buckley, Francis, Sobran and Kirk once stood.
Conservatism is now the
<a href="https://youtu.be/qAXzzHM8zLw?t=148" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Stonehenge scene</a> from the movie *This Is Spinal
Tap*. The only thing preventing people from noticing the absurdity of
the Right is the over-the-top lunacy of the Left.

It is popular to compare what is happening today with what happened in
the 1970’s, as many of the performers were around back then. The
gerontocracy is made up of people who still have some corduroy suits in
their closet. The big difference is there is no net underneath the Left
this time. There is no conservative movement ready to step in and make
things right. When this clown car veers off the road, there is not
rescue team ready to pull it out of the ditch.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
