Since Russophobia will be with us for the time being, it is probably a
good idea for dissidents to think about Russia. The presentation of
Russia in our media, like everything else, is not connected with
reality. Instead, it is intended to promote managerial elite schemes,
like project Ukraine. The real Russia is not much like the media
portrayal and much more interesting to dissidents.

The funny thing about Russia is that they face similar problems that we
face in North America, except the Russian rulers have not sought to make
them worse with suicidal immigration policies. The Russian Federation is
about eighty percent Russian, demographically similar to America in the
1980’s. That means Russia has a significant minority population it must
manage in order to keep the peace.

Unlike America, Russia has never been at war with itself over its
minority populations and how they are treated. It has not always been a
happy relationship, especially during the Stalin years, but Russians are
not racked with guilt by how they have treated their minority
populations in the past. Instead, it is either ignored or part of the
greater Russian identity that includes these minority groups.

There are a lot of differences between Russia and America, but both are
continent sized countries with lots of demographic diversity. How Russia
has evolved its own identity in order to manage its diversity versus the
lunacy we see in America offers an opening to think about what could
come next for America. North America needs a new ideology, and a new
identity and Russia offers some clues to that.
