Today the leader of the GOP took to the airwaves to deride Obama’s war
on the middle class. Using data from a <a
href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/working_papers/pfeffer-danziger-schoeni_wealth-levels.pdf"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just released study done by
liberal think tank the Russell Sage Foundation</a>, Reince Prebis
pointed to figures showing that 75% of Americans are now poorer that
they were under Bush. In 2003, median household net worth was $25,000
dollars higher than it is today. Pounding his fist upon the podium for
emphasis, he said, “Under this administration the middle class has been
hammered.”

OK, that’s not true. It would be nice if it were true, but that’s just a
fantasy. The study is true, but the response from the Republicans is
made up. The men running the GOP are too timid and stupid to play on the
middle-class fears that their way of life is under assault from their
own government. Plus, who names their child Reince? What kind of name is
that? Putting that aside, the soft men of the Republican Party are
incapable to addressing the concerns of their own voters.

Instead, they will allow a plutocrat like Elizabeth Warren get away with
class warfare rhetoric and paint the GOP as the party of billionaires.
If Lee Atwater were alive, he’d have a press conference every day
bashing the Democrats for their war on the middle, forcing the press to
do their damn job even if they hated it. He was probably the last
Republican to show anything like a spine.

Here’s the summary:

In fairness, housing prices have not recovered, despite the trillions
pumped in from the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the hidden
inflation due to that pump should have lifted all boats. Anyone who buys
things like food, utilities, gas and clothing knows that things are much
more expensive now than a decade ago. Still, no matter how you want to
put your finger on the scale, the facts are as presented. The middle and
lower class have taken in the pooper under this president.
