One of the consequences of partisanship is that it insulates the
partisan from the rest of the world to the extent that their reality is
deranged. They only know what the others in their group know and that is
limited to what is best for the group. Civic nationalists decry
partisanship for this reason. It makes objective truth
impossible. Radicals, of course, embrace partisanship because they
reject objective truth. It is why modern radicals literally speak of
*their truth*.

The funny thing about partisanship is both sides are correct. Politics
is about friends and enemies, which leaves little room for objectivity.
In politics you want to advance your interests or the interests of your
side. That often means doing so at the expense of those viewed as
enemies. If the facts say you should yield in deference to your
opponent, then you have no choice but to reject the facts. Otherwise,
you lose and that undermines the point of politics.

The reality of politics in a participatory system is that the winners
and those with some chance to win must be partisans and reject objective
truth. The outsiders, those seeking to crack the nut of the political
dynamic, must embrace what they claim to be objective truth, in order to
wedge open the door of politics. In other words, appeals to truth are
just another partisan tool. It is the outsider who can embrace objective
reality, because he has no skin in the game of politics.

An example of this is this New York Times [opinion
piece](https://archive.ph/HcA9o) by two extremist law professors calling
for the abolition of the constitution. The very first sentence in their
piece is a lie designed to advance their agenda. “When liberals lose in
the Supreme Court — as they increasingly have over the past half-century
— they usually say that the justices got the Constitution wrong.”
Liberals so rarely lose in court that when it happens, it is literally
news for months, as we see with abortion.

The point of the lie is to butter up the intended audience with a bit of
flattery to let them know the writers are fellow partisans. “We keep
trying to use reason on these odious monsters, but they are immune to
reason, so here is what we do.” In effect, the partisan statement at the
start is an appeal to abandon objectivity. The next sentence makes that
exact demand and the next paragraph explains why. What they mean by
“rejecting constitutionalism” is the rejection of objective truth.

Of course, in order to make that work logically, they have to provide a
definition of “constitution” that is itself a lie. These legal scholars
from two of the most important elite academies in the empire claim that
a constitution is about “setting more sacrosanct rules than the ones the
legislature can pass.” You see, it is just an arbitrary set of “super
rules” that were made up out of convenience. Most likely, the people
behind it were bad people, being from the past and all that.

The argument in favor of a constitution has always been that it is a
formalization of the superstructure of society. For any human grouping
to hold together it must first answer the question, “Who are we?” The
answer to the question must be filled out by a set of rules that define
the answer. A constitution is what complex societies create to define
themselves as a people. In one sentence the liberal tradition is
discarded and relegated to partisan whimsy by these two radical legal
scholars.

The rest of the piece is an argument in favor of overthrowing what
remains of the liberal order and instituting what amounts to fascism.
They imagine a totalitarian model of the law based on the tyranny of the
majority. They make no effort to explain why fifty percent plus one is a
sacred number. That is the partisan mind. The partisan never puts
thought into analyzing his own statements of faith. Words exist for
purely partisan reasons, to signal the who? whom? of politics.

Interestingly, the people chanting democratic phrases, while claiming to
appeal to the will of the people, make clear that who decides is what
matters. “Liberals have been attempting to reclaim the Constitution for
50 years — with agonizingly little to show for it. It’s time for them to
radically alter the basic rules of the game.” The basic argument here is
not against constitutions, but about who makes the rules. Objectively,
this is a purely anti-democratic argument.

That is why the Left is immune to claims of hypocrisy. They can easily
allow contradictory claims exist in their mind, as long as both claims
advance the partisan agenda of their group. On the one hand they can
demand democracy and on the other demand tyrannical control of the law.
Both claims are useful in the partisan game of politics, so both can
exist in the same toolbox. For the partisan, the contradiction makes
reaching for the right tool easier.

Here is a great example. “No matter how openly political it may purport
to be, reclaiming the Constitution remains a kind of antipolitics. It
requires the substitution of claims about the best reading of some
centuries-old text or about promises said to be already in our
traditions for direct arguments about what fairness or justice demands.”
The first sentence is self-contradictory. The last sentence is a promise
to impose the values of a tiny minority on the population, in the name
of democracy.

From the outside, the partisanship of Ryan D. Doerfler and Samuel Moyn,
the authors of the piece, is monstrous. The only end is a bloodbath.
These two are making the same basic claim as Pol Pot. The thing is, they
are correct about one thing. It is who decides that matters, not how
they decide. Constitutions must always be about who decides, first and
foremost. This ensures the laws maintain this relationship between the
rulers and their people.

That was the critical mistake of the Founders. It left open the door for
others to decide and that is what led to the nightmare of the 20th
century and the current crisis. At the other end of this crisis will be
the answer to who decides going forward. Will it be vengeful aliens or
the founding stock? In the end, the point of politics is not words on a
paper but who puts the words on the paper. Ironically, that is the one
objective truth that every partisan can accept.
