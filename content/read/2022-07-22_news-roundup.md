Something I did not cover in the show is the fate of the most popular
president in human history, who has come down with Covid. This is
interesting for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which is that
Biden used to angrily lecture us that only unvaccinated people could get
Covid. It seems like a long time ago, but he was the leader of the
“pandemic of the unvaccinated” chorus.

On a personal note, I was one of the few people pointing out that this
mRNA technology had never worked very well in livestock. The boost in
immunity was short-lived and tended to have a much higher rate of
negative reactions. In livestock, the latter can be counted as a cost of
doing business, but we do not do that sort of math for humans when it
comes to vaccines.

Now, that does not mean the vaccine was all bad. For someone like Biden
who is very old and frail, the risks are worth it. Even with the very
mild variants kicking around, Covid is still a killer of the very weak.
The same applies to the flu. If you are over seventy, getting a flu shot
is a risk worth taking. For everyone else, unless you have a special
medical condition, the vaccine was never a good idea.

Putting that aside, you see the problem we have by the near total
silence from the Republican party on this issue. They could be using
this to hammer Biden, but they were onboard with the vaccine mandates
too. The same is true of the conservatives, who forgot all about their
principles during the panic. All of these people believe the same
things, they just disagree over the presentation.

The greatest boondoggle in human history will be flushed down the memory
hole because no one in the managerial class will speak out against it.
Most have already forgotten the whole thing. Those who know got the
message a long time ago and they keep quiet to keep their position. It
is like how everyone knows the reality of crime, but no one ever talks
about it in public.
