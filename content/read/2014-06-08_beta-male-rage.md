rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> on Drudge says
the under-30 set are flocking to a movie about a beta male, rather than
the sci-fiction action flick. This is nothing new. Cruise has seen his
fortunes decline over the last decade, but he is not alone. The
traditional male lead has been fading for years. Movie tough guys are
long gone. Instead we get cartoon characters like Batman or Spider-man.
Then you have the cartoonish guys like Hugh Jackman and The Rock.
Otherwise, male leads are wimps now.

Trends and fads are what they are. People live in their time and young
people lack the perspective to stand outside themselves and see their
time in context. They think things are the way they are because they
have always been the way they are. The past is stories told by old
people about a country that no longer exists. That’s the benefit of
youth, but also the curse of it. That means the trendy beta males of
today are only just becoming aware of the fact they look a lot like the
pussies and wimps of yesteryear.

Of course, there’s something else going on beyond silly fads. Starting
in the 80’s, there has been a  campaign against the traditional white
male. Boys in school were loaded up with mind altering drugs so they
would be more like little girls. Male characters on TV were portrayed as
stupid, foolish, emotional and helpless. On the other hand, female
action heroes (hilariously) were pushed on the culture in movies. The
results are what we see today, a rising gynocracy.

Americans no longer like male leads that are men of action. They prefer
the soft, sexually ambiguous beta males. Look at the number of female
action heroes. It is why every male under the age of 30 is trying to
look like a young George Michael. The movies reflect the tastes of the
customers. – See more at:
