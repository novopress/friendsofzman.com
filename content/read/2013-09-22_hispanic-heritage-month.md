I’m watching the NFL and I keep seeing references to <a
href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000245872/article/nfl-celebrates-hispanic-heritage-month"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hispanic Heritage Month</a>. I watch the
NFL via Red Zone so it is a bit of an echo chamber for whatever they are
hawking each Sunday. It reminded me of traveling through Hispania as a
boy with my parents. It was so odd hearing everyone speak Hispanish
instead of English. Of course, even a child had to be impressed with the
great achievements in Hispanic culture.

My goodness. There is no such thing as Hispanic culture outside the
blinkered world of identity politics. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans call
themselves Hispanic unless they are getting paid to do it. The word
“Hispanic” is like the word “African-American” in that the only time you
hear it is when ruling class types are around. I live in a black
neighborhood and I never her anyone say “African-American.” Not even me.

More important, let’s say we’re lumping all Latin culture into one
bucket for the sake of brevity, why would anyone celebrate it? Hispanic
culture sucks. We know this because half of Latin American is trying
flee it for North American culture. Even Africans, given the choice of
Mexico or staying put are not going to Mexico. These people are coming
here to get away from Hispanic culture, not celebrate it here.

It is, of course, just part of the larger anti-white campaign. The Cold
Civil War, between good whites and bad whites, has been hijacked by
foreign elements and slowly turned into a war on whites in general. It’s
not as obvious now, but it will get increasingly obvious in the coming
years. Cerebrating Hispanic culture is really just a way of celebrating
the planned death of white culture.
