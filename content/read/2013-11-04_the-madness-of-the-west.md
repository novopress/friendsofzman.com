Every society has its lunacy. Almost always, it stems from ignorance.
Ancient people believed that the gods arrange the stars and made the sun
rise and set. They lacked the capacity to understand the science we now
take for granted. Their mythologies provided a useful explanation to a
natural phenomenon. What seems nutty to people of today, made perfect
sense 2500 years ago. It explained what they saw and that was enough.

Late 19th century Americans fell for all sorts of patent medicines,
thinking they would improve their health. In most cases they were
harmless scams. In some cases they were poison. Today, people believe
organic food is better than the regular stuff. They don’t know that most
of what they buy as organic is the same stuff as the non-organic produce
sitting in the next bin. Again, it is mostly ignorance. You’ll find that
the people with the weird food fetishes know the least about how food
gets from farm to market.

That said,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24767225" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this is weird</a> beyond words. Since the dawn of time,
we have known that humans come in one of two sexes. We know a lot about
the genetic differences between men and women. The Olympics actually
tests female athletes to ensure they are not
dudes. <span style="line-height: 1.625;">There is some very tiny portion
of people who possess both male and female genetics, but you have a
better chance of being struck by lightning twice on your way to cashing
your winning lottery ticket than every meeting such a person.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.625;">The people going in for “gender
reassignment” are not in that group. They are mentally ill in the same
way people who think they are space aliens or animals. No matter how
earnest and sincere an
“</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin" rel="noopener"
style="line-height: 1.625;" target="_blank">otherkin</a><span style="line-height: 1.625;">”
may be, they are not animals. Indulging them is not an act of kindness.
It is cruelty. Allowing someone to live in a disturbed state of delusion
is cruel and we should not do it. Encouraging people
to </span>mutilate<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> </span>themselves<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> in
order to act out their delusions is monstrous. The people promoting it
should be stoned.</span>

That said, you can see where this is headed. First there is the demand
that these degenerates be tolerated. Then they have to be accepted. Then
the morality flips and you are no longer a good person for being
indifferent. Now you must celebrate their degeneracy as some sort of
moral good. In the near future, normal people will have their lives
ruined for not showing the proper enthusiasm for the guy in the sundress
chasing after the kids at the playground. This madness can’t end fast
enough.
