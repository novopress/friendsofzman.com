Israel’s efforts to start a regional war in the Middle East took a big
step forward when they murdered a Hamas official in Tehran and another
in Beirut. The murder of Fuad Shukr in Lebanon is something the Israelis
have been doing for a long time, but the missile attack killing Ismail
Haniyeh in Tehran is both a clear violation of international law and a
provocative escalation. Taken together it suggests that the Israelis
want a war with Iran and are doing everything they can to provoke it.

The puzzle is why are they are doing this, especially now when it is
clear that Washington is in turmoil and the American empire is stretched
thin. Joe Biden is at best a caretaker at the moment. Netanyahu met with
him last week, so he must know that Biden is a vegetable. He also has to
know that it is not clear who will be in the White House six months from
now. The only thing certain is it will be a new team running foreign
policy, regardless of the results.

It may be that Netanyahu calculates that if the next administration
inherits a regional war in the Middle East, they will have little choice
but to continue whatever policy they inherit, so it is best to get
everything in place now. It is not as if the Israelis do not have
control of both parties. The neocons may think Trump wins the election,
so leaving him with a regional war will cripple his term before it gets
started. As a result, they are telling the Israelis to start the war.

Another theory floating around is that the Israelis have determined that
Iran does not want a war right now, so their response to these moves
will be limited. The Israelis can literally get away with murder, as
long as the people they are targeting are not Iranian officials or
important Iranian citizens. The two people they just murdered have been
on their kill list for a long time. Targeted assassinations have always
been a part of the Israeli toolkit, despite the civilized world’s
protests.

Along the same lines, the Israelis may be looking at the way things are
shaping up in the neighborhood and think they have to flip over the
board with a war. Russia and Iran have close ties. China is now building
relations with Iran. This has led the Saudis to end the petro-dollar
agreement and begin to normalize relations with Iran now that they are
both in BRICS. A new regional order is forming up where Russia and China
supplant the American empire as the patron.

From the Israeli perspective, this is a catastrophe. Both Russia and
China are wise to how the Israelis operates, and they have no Israel
lobby in their countries. While both countries have always tried to
maintain good relations with Israel, they both see Israel as part of the
Global American Empire. It is not all that clear if they understand how
the neocons use Zionism as a cover, but they certainly understand that
Israel is a launching pad for American shenanigans in the region.

Instability has always been part of the Israel playbook too. Whether it
is exploiting rivalries between its neighbors or rivalries inside its
neighbors, the game has always been to maximize regional instability.
This not only keeps the Arab countries on shaky ground, but it keeps the
American empire involved. A war with Iran that draws in other Arab
countries, thus forcing the American empire to get directly involved
maximizes uncertainty and instability in the region.

One final possibility here is that the neocons may have decided that the
Ukraine project is hopeless, so it is time to open a new front. Russia
has strong relations with Iran, so war between the American empire and
Iran would inevitably force the Russians to provide support to Iran.
This would fit with the overall
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">strategy</a> laid out by the Rand
Corporation five years ago and the philosophical <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Chessboard-American-Geostrategic-Imperatives/dp/0465027253/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">outlook</a> of the neocons going back to
the end of the Cold War.

The question no one asks is if the American empire could wage a war
against Iran and whether it could survive it. For decades it has just
been assumed that the empire will win any war with any nation if it so
chooses. A big part of the mythos of the American war machine is the
assertion that the only wars the empire has “lost” are those it chose
not to fight to win. This started with Vietnam and has been a fog that
rests over any analysis of American war capacity.

The Ukraine war revealed this to be a myth. American wonder weapons
either failed to live up to their promise or were quickly neutralized by
the Russians. More importantly, NATO has been exposed as a paper tiger
with regards to its ability to manufacture the sorts of weapons
necessary for a long war. You can also throw in the failure to suppress
the Houthis with expensive bombing campaigns. Clearly, the rest of the
world learned something from thirty years of American war making.

Iran does not have the military industrial capacity of Russia, but it
does have the support of Russia and China. Iran can also count on Syria
and Iraq to help deliver weapons and men to the border of Israel. She
can also count on OPEC not coming to the rescue when oil prices double
overnight. In other words, whatever the motivations, a regional war that
drags in the American empire to fight Iran could very well be a
catastrophe for the American empire.

What all of this points to is exhaustion. The Israeli political culture
is a chaotic mess that shows all the signs of being a spent force. It is
a bunch of old guys living in the past, trying to cling onto life and
power. This is not much different from the state of play in Washington,
where it is a political class trapped in the last century. The flailing
about that now defines imperial foreign policy is the result of
yesterday men unable to come to terms with the reality of current age.

If this comes to pass, the American empire would not be the first to
face its mortality in the Middle East. The Romans eventually learned
that the Middle East was more trouble than it was worth. Perhaps it also
spells the end of the Zionist project. It has been eighty years since
the birth of the Zionist state, so maybe they are about to succumb to
the
[curse](https://mizrachi.org/hamizrachi/the-curse-of-the-eighth-decade/)
of the eight decade. Of course, the Global American Empire is in its
eighth decade as well, so maybe there is something to it.
