Much has been written in these parts about the crisis of competence that
is creepy up on all aspects of life like the fog. Every day, competent
people are aging out and being replaced by people who lack the
competence. A complimentary problem, one also driven by demographics, is
the Dunning-Kruger crisis. This the problem of incompetent, but highly
confidence people, getting elevated into positions for which they are
unqualified, simply due to the new ethics of the elites.

The difference here is that the crisis of competence is somewhat
correctable, as the unqualified millennial replacing the retiring
boomer, has some hope of learning what he needs to learn to do the job.
He and his organization will have to suffer through the learning curve,
but there is hope he will become competent. Alternatively, the race to
supplement or even replace the incompetent millennial with technology
offers the alternative of a robot competently doing the job.

The Dunning-Kruger, in contrast, offers no such hope. The person
elevated into the position to satisfy the needs of the new morality has
no chance to ever become competent at the task. Replacing them with
technology is impossible, because it would undermine the whole point of
the process. Instead, the system is simply expected to adapt to these
new islands of confident incompetence. Every organization is being
loaded up with crosses to bear as a form of contrition.

You see how this works with the Kamala Harris campaign. Regardless of
the result, it will be remembered as one of the most inept operations in
modern history, perhaps rivaling the 2004 Howard Dean campaign in Iowa
or even the 1988 Mike Dukakis presidential campaign. After the initial
media gaslighting, it has been one unforced error after another, all
stemming from the fact the people running the campaign are sure they
know everything, but in fact know nothing.

One small example is the Joe Rogan flap. Rogan is the biggest carnival
act in so-called new media, so doing his show would be like doing Johnny
Carson back in the 1970’s or the Rush Limbaugh show in the 1990’s. It
offers a unique setting in front of a huge audience, which itself will
attract an even bigger audience. It is the sort of platform a candidate
needing attention craves. You take the gig, hope for the best and
prepare for the explosion of post-show media coverage.

The Harris campaign never understood this. Instead, they tried to strong
arm Rogan into rolling over for them, even leaving his comfy studio to
meet them at a hotel somewhere to record a one-hour interview. They
should have known he had no reason to take that deal, but stupid people
lack second order thinking. Their unearned confidence in themselves
compounded the error by carrying on as if they were doing him a favor by
entertaining the request.

Rogan, who never liked Trump, did the shrewd thing and invited Trump on
his show and Trump happily accepted the millions in free media. The
resulting program broke the internet and further humanized Trump. The
theme of his campaign this time is that he has dropped the sharp edges,
having learned from the past. Hamming it up with Rogan, who was a
smitten kitten the whole time, underscored this theme. Team
Dunning-Kruger handed Trump a huge win as a result.

This one incident among many is a microcosm of the growing
Dunning-Kruger crisis we see unfolding everywhere. It is not just that
these people lack the required talents or experience for the task. It is
that they lack the innate ability for the roles and the self-awareness
to recognize it. Stupid people who realize they are outmatched can be
managed, but stupid people who think they are geniuses are a danger to
everyone and everything they touch. Invisible stupidity is lethal.

Look at who is running the Harris campaign, and the problem is obvious.
The campaign boss is named Julie Chávez Rodriguez. She has three names
because her only reason to exist in politics is she is the granddaughter
of Cesario Chavez. Her qualifications for politics are that she is
female, brownish and related to a famous brown guy. She has parlayed
that into a career doing busy work, so that the nice white ladies could
put her face on the organization brochure.

Julie Chávez Rodriguez no doubt looks in the mirror each morning and
sees a world bestriding figure, when in reality she is a hapless
simpleton. She is in this role because of her long relationship with
Kamala Harris, another strong diverse female who is brimming with
confidence despite having done nothing on her own worth noting, other
than being a concubine of Willie Brown. The Harris campaign operates
like the marketing pitch for the Christopher Rufo project.

There have been terrible national campaigns in the past, but the cause
was always a candidate with little to sell running against a favored
incumbent. Mike Dukakis never had a chance in 1988, so his people had
few good choices. Bob Dole in 1996 was simply running to pad his
obituary. He had no chance against Clinton, and he certainly knew it,
but played the role anyway. Harris has the full support of official
Washington and the political regime but is still losing.

Given the reality of our politics, this sort of ineptitude may seem
trivial, but the Dunning-Kruger crisis is rolling out everywhere. It is
why certain members of the economic elite are panicking about DEI at
elite universities. They suddenly realized that their good deed
installing someone like Claudine Gay as president of Harvard could come
at a price to them beyond embarrassment. Handing power to entitled
stupid people brimming with unearned confidence is playing with fire.

It is comforting to think that maybe the outbreak of incompetence among
the elites due to the cult of diversity will cause them to pull back,
but that is not the way to bet because of the religious fanaticism
around the cult of diversity. If Harris loses next week, expect to hear
endless cries of racism. If she wins, the resulting catastrophe will be
blamed on the bogeyman. The Dunning-Kruger crisis ends only when the
forces and people behind it come to an end.
