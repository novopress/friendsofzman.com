One of the things you learn as you travel around this world of ours is
that people are not all the same. Way back in the olden thymes, our
school teachers had just picked up Cultural Marxism and were preaching
to us about how people everywhere were the same. I recall learning the
word “ethnocentrism” in the fourth grade. We were about to learn about
Japan and India and the teacher spent an hour telling us about how not
to laugh at the weird things we were about to learn. That’s close to
half a century now for our ruling fanatics to scream epithets against
reality. Yet, reality is still here.

Race and culture are just stubborn things and will not yield to wishful
thinking. Although I identify as African-American, my ancestors having
left the dark continent 50,000 years ago, I am white. I’m very white.
Other white people assume I am white and of the white culture. Black
people make the same assumption. It is not that everyone is racist. It
is that they have eyes and notice things like skin color. People also
notice that, the occasional <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Oreo</em></a> and
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wigger"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Wigger</em></a>
notwithstanding, that skin color tracks closely with race and culture in
America.

A good example of this is the film
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2180016/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp</a>. Until last night,
I had never heard of the movie or knew much about the man. I am a fan of
true crime so I am familiar with notorious criminals of all races.
People find it odd that I can recall the names of obscure ghetto
gangsters, but every man has his hobbies. Not only was I not very
familiar with Mr. Slim, I had no idea he played such a big role in the
culture of black America. Here’s the trailer:

Documentaries about people long after they are gone are usually full of
lies.The director is not going to have a bunch of people on-screen
saying they never heard of the subject of the documentary. Instead they
find people willing to say they share the director’s passion for the
subject. Still, according to Wiki, Slim’s books sold millions of copies
in the 1970’s, exclusively to black readers. Yet, few white people have
ever heard of him or hold “pimping” in the same regard as black
Americans.

That last bit is an important takeaway. The Left can rattle on about
racism all they like, but people have eyes and they see things. Black
people are covetous of their culture, black culture. They don’t want it
thrown into the diversity blender. They want their heroes and
antiheroes. Iceberg Slim is not an “American” here. Most Americans have
never heard of him. He is a black hero, unique to black culture.

It is why being authentically black looms so large for successful black
entertainers, sports stars and politicians. Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock
live like the Clevers but they pretend to live in the ghetto. I’m more
gangster than those two phonies, but they have to “keep it real” and
pretend to be ghetto whenever the cameras are rolling. Otherwise, they
are not authentically black and will lose their audience.

That said, your culture is not getting very far if you insist on
celebrating social pathologies as if they were cultural achievements.
Much of American culture these days is exactly that, a celebration of
the base and the crude. One television show after another is holding up
the riff-raff and carny freaks as role models. Snoop Dogg got very rich
pimping the nation’s youth out like whores. For most of human history
entertainers were treated as scum, pushed to the fringe of society.
Today they are in charge, telling us about the greatness of a ghetto
pimp.
