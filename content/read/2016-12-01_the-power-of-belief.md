When I was a young man, I dated a girl who had a crazy uncle. He was a
math whiz and he had worked at NASA on the Apollo missions. He was one
of those wacky professor types, who enjoyed being eccentric more than he
was good at it. In other words, his eccentric routine was a bit
contrived. Even so, he was a character and I enjoyed spending time
around him. We would play chess and talk about history. He was not very
good at chess, but he knew a lot about history and he enjoyed debating
it with anyone interested.

The thing that was puzzling about him was that he was a way out where
the buses don’t run Progressive. He would rant about how private
property was the ruin of humanity and the cause of all trouble. This was
a very smart man with a firm grasp of advanced mathematics and a deep
knowledge of history. Yet, when it came to politics, he was as nutty as
a sociology professor at a state college. As soon as current politics
came up in conversation, he went from normal to moonbat.

I was reminded of it reading
<a href="http://www.thebigquestions.com/2016/11/27/why-she-lost/"
target="_blank">this post by Steven Landsburg</a>. His blog exists to
promote his books, but he posts about other stuff too. A fun book to
read is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Questions-Philosophy-Mathematics-Economics/dp/143914821X"
target="_blank">The Big Questions</a>, which is overly ambitious and
hilariously wrong at points, but still a fun read. From the blog post:

Landsburg is a bright guy with a broad knowledge base. He has a PhD in
mathematics.Yet, he is instinctively drawn to the Cult like a moth to a
flame. That post reads like a personal struggle. He was drawn to one
anti-Trump cause after another, not for logical reasons, but emotional
ones. That was inevitably going to lead him to supporting Hillary
Clinton, which would nullify all of his previous arguments about
economics, politics and philosophy. But, Trump, the terrible Trump!

If you have read Landsburg, you know he is an open borders fanatic and a
free trade zealot. The fact that neither of these positions makes any
sense is not important to him. They offer an outlet for his missionary
zeal and a way to get grace on the cheap. Salvation is a huge part of
what drives the fanatic. Since modern fanatics no longer believe in God
or the soul, they have fashioned economic theories and arguments to fill
in these blanks. At the heart of their zeal lies the age old religious
impulse to save the world.

Now, there’s another aspect to this. The most prominent libertarians
live on the adult day care centers we call the college campus. Others
live in the satellite version called the think tank. Most of their
friends are in the Cult and often quite passionate about it. As a
result, the most prominent libertarians spend their days trying to carve
out an exception for themselves that does not vex their peers. Going in
for the lunacy of NeverTrump was a cheap way to earn piety points with
the nut jobs on campus.

Still, it is a good reminder that you can be highly intelligent and also
have a head full of nonsense. J. B. S. Haldane was, by all accounts, a
brilliant man. He was also a committed Marxist, even when it became
clear that Marxism was a death cult. Lots of brilliant people were
attracted to communism in the 20th century, despite the irrationality of
it. Today, the blank slate beliefs of Progressives are catnip for
intellectuals, even though a walk around any shopping mall offers ample
evidence to contradict it. It just feels good to believe.
