Feeling a bit lazy, I decided to see what the world of sports
entertainment was offering on a Tuesday before Thanksgiving. In a better
age, the answer would have been nothing unless you lived in a city with
an NBA or NHL team. They would play their games before the weekend and
then take off for the holiday. In this age, the people who run the
sports leagues think Christmas is the perfect time to make their mostly
black employees perform for them and the rest of us.

A few minutes looking at the sports sites and it was clear it was going
to be college basketball or nothing at all, always a good option. It has
been so long since I have consumed college basketball, it was a bit
confusing. The game that jumped out at me was Midway University versus
Bellarmine. Midway is not located on a Pacific island, as the name would
suggest. It is in Kentucky and originally called the Kentucky Female
Orphan School. Now they play men’s basketball.

One of the things you quickly notice when scanning the college
basketball schedule is that we have far too many colleges. Not to pick
on the good folks at the Kentucky Female Orphan School, but what is the
point? When it was actually a female orphan school, it made some sense.
Taking care of female orphans is a good thing, but now it is a
university handing out worthless credentials. We could easily shutter
half of our colleges, and no one would notice.

That aside, the other thing that caught my eye is the array or weird
platforms on which these games are now broadcast. The shift away from
traditional television to the internet has led to a proliferation of
sites. There was a tournament broadcast on something called FloSports,
which sounds like a name created by the con men who run the sports
nutrition rackets. It turns out that they
<a href="https://www.flosports.tv/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">specialize</a> in low interest niche sports and the
small-timers in major sports.

They charge $30 per month for their service, which seems like a big
number for the content they are offering. Perhaps if you love F1 racing
and you live in the United States, that is a bargain. They are
sponsoring college basketball tournaments on the assumption that the
fans of the teams involved will spend the money to watch a few games of
their favorite team. It is a clever racket, but it also a form of
kidnapping in that they are holding the content hostage.

This is something happening with all sports. The NFL is now posting
games on Amazon Prime, thus forcing fans to subscribe to it for games,
in addition to whatever they use for other television content. There is
a network called Peacock that now has select college football games. If
you are a fan of Notre Dame, you now must subscribe to the Peacock thing
to see their games. It will not be long before much of the sports
content is behind an array of paywalls.

This is a sign of decline. As these pay-per-view schemes proliferate,
the ways around them proliferate just as fast. Getting the content from
FloSports, for example, is simple if you know where to look. There are
lots of overseas operators who are indifferent to the financial dreams
of our entertainment schemers. With a VPN you can watch just about any
sporting event on earth without paying a dime. In fact, you can get any
content you like this way, even new release movies.

What you see forming up is what happened to the music rackets. By the
1980’s, the music industry was dependent on two bottlenecks. One was
album sales where you paid for ten songs, even though you wanted just
one song. The other was commercial radio where you could listen to that
one song, but also hours of ads and live reads from drug-addled disc
jockeys. The music rackets charged the crap out of the radio stations
for use of their content.

Then the mp3 arrived and that was the end of the music rackets. Suddenly
you could get that one song without buying an album. Not only that, but
the song was also free, and you could easily make copies for your
friends. The music industry fought this, but eventually they lost the
fight. Now recorded music is just a marketing expense to promote live
shows and sell other product. Bands now make more money selling t-shirts
and caps than they make from recorded music.

This is what is happening to sports. People are willing to watch a game
made twice as long by the insertion of advertising. They will pay a
small fee to watch games with the same ads, but if they have choices.
They will pay a higher fee for ad free content and lots of choices. They
will not pay high fees for what amounts to a three-hour ad campaign with
some sports content sprinkled into it. They will find other ways to see
the games or simply stop watching.

The lesson of the mp3 is that you cannot beat technology. The music
companies sued people for sharing music, but it had no impact on the
process. The sports leagues can try the same thing with the pirate
sites, but it will fail too. It is simply too easy to access these
sites. What is even funnier about this is most of the pirate sites block
the ads during the games. The leagues cannot even say to their
advertisers that their ads are getting viewed by the pirate users.

There is a cost to this. Pop music has reached a nadir because the only
way to make money is to generate Potemkin stars like Taylor Swift. The
reason you never hear anyone talk about the content of a Taylor Swift
song is because even her fans do not care about the content. It is
simply a thing to be swept up in until she gets too fat to make it work
and a new star is generated. The same is true for the butt wigglers who
target the black music audience.

This may be why movies and television are terrible now. On the one hand,
they need to make going to the theater appealing, which means massive
computer-generated worlds that dazzle on the big screen. On the other
hand, it means dealing with the reality that content best watched at
home is easily pirated. That leaves little motivation to pay for quality
writing and directing. Instead, the money goes to attention grabbing
nonsense like race-swapping and girl bosses.

That paints a bleak picture for sports entertainment. A model built on
the assumption that television revenues will continue to grow at double
digit rates is not going to do well when the revenue stops growing
entirely. Throw in the fact that owning a team is mostly about tax
dodging and rent seeking and you see the problem. Like music in the
1980’s, the sports entertainment world is a massive bubble. Similarly,
technology is the pin that will pop that bubble.
