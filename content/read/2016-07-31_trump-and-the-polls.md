[A new
poll](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/31/hold-draft-embargo/)
after the nomination of the old hag as the Evil Party candidate suggests
she got a mild boost from the show. Of course, Trump got a boost after
his convention, but then [the polling companies changed their
methods](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/30/exclusive-pat-caddell-blasts-reuters-back-rigging-polls-to-show-clinton-winning/)
in order put Clinton back in the lead. There are [other polls showing
Trump with a big
lead](https://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/latest-polls/election-2016/us-presidential-election-daily-tracking-poll/)
and probably polls showing a dead heat. With the election more than
three months out and most Americans enjoying the summer, the wild swing
in the polls seems logical. It is why partisans are prone to dismiss any
poll that does not make them feel good.

Polling science is said to be much better now than in the past. After
each election we are told the pollsters got it close to right. Once in a
while they miss, like we saw with Brexit or the last Parliament election
in Britain. Obviously, the polling was wildly off with Trump early on
and he did over-perform against the polls throughout the primary. That
suggests the polling companies have not yet figured out how to identity
the voter pool. Or maybe the critics are right and the pollsters are
lying to help the establishment.

It is easy to be skeptical of polling. The sample sizes are so small, it
is hard to see how they can be representative of the voter pool. What is
never disclosed is the number of people who refuse to participate. It is
reasonable to assume that the hard thumping fanatics want to be polled,
while normal people have better things to do with their time. A
generation ago normal people may have been inclined to participate,
feeling it was their duty as a citizen, but those days are long gone.
The normies are woke.

Then there is that other reason to be skeptical. Everywhere you look the
media is conspiring to deceive the public. A Muslim shoots up a gay club
and we get stories about how he was a homosexual struggling with his
sexuality. All of those stories were lies. We get a dump of DNC e-mails
showing a clear conspiracy between the media and the party, but the
story they tell us is about Boris Badenov secretly conspiring with
Trump. If you are willing to lie like that, rigging polls is no great
shakes.

That said, quantitative types will argue that some polls are fairly
good. They get within a point or two of the results. Nate Silver’s new
model was laughably wrong in the primaries, but his old model was pretty
close to right in most of the primaries. He may have been off a few
points, but he was picking the correct winner in every case. Investors
Business Daily has been within a point the last few elections. They
missed on the 2012 winner, but that was a close election and they were
better than the rest.

The counter to this is that the range of possible results in any
election is pretty small. Since the end WW2, the average difference in
the popular vote is a little under nine percent. The big outlier was
Reagan beating Mondale 58% to 40% in 1984. Most elections are within a
5% range so that means about five possible outcomes. In most of these
elections, it was long clear who would win. Of those sixteen elections,
only six had any mystery to them and that is counting 1968 and 2000.

The point here is that claiming you nailed twelve of the last sixteen
elections means nothing. Where pollsters are measured is when the final
result is a mystery or debatable. Silver getting the 2012 election right
made him a star because everyone else got it wrong. His star has now
faded because he blew the primaries so badly. It suggests he was just
lucky for a while or maybe his great insight was just a moment in time.
The mood of the country has changed and the polling methods have
changed, so his algorithm is now worse than guessing.

There is also a new element here that we have not seen in our lifetime.
The people in charge universally hate Trump. The media of both parties,
the leadership of both parties, all sides of the chattering skull class,
all of the beautiful people, everyone. They all hate Trump and the
people backing Trump. This is a revolt of the elites and it is
reasonable to assume that the pollsters feel pressure to put their thumb
on the scales. If you are going to do that, this is when you do it
because everyone is doing it.

Even if the pollsters are playing it straight, they are facing an
impossible task. What will this electorate be like compared to previous
elections? We know lots of new voters are turning up. That was the story
of the primary. We know lots of people are changing teams. Nationals
Review, The Federalist and Red State are now wearing [their woman
cards](https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/the-woman-card), backing
a candidate they excoriated just a year ago. At the same time, old Lefty
warhorses like Susan Sarandon are flirting with Trump.

At least for now, no poll, even those that make you feel good, should be
trusted. We are in uncharted territory in many ways. The pollsters, even
those playing it straight, are just as lost as everyone else. More
important, the people we tend to rely on for information are
feverishly working against our interests to a level we have never seen.
If they are willing to claim Trump is working for the KGB, they will say
anything and do anything. All bets are off now, so trust no one.
