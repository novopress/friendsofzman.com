------------------------------------------------------------------------

An important insight of Karl Marx was that rights, as in individual
rights established in the law, create inequality. The reason for this is
obvious. People are not equal so left to their own devices, they will
have different life outcomes. More important, since human society is
defined by scarcity, this will inevitably result in the unequal
distribution of the benefits of society. A rights regime will impact the
distributive choices because the more talented will lay claim to a
greater share of benefits.

Communism would solve this problem by first producing superabundance, so
that those distributive choices were greatly simplified. Of course,
superabundance is only possible when you eliminate gross inequality.
This leads to Marx’s expression, “From each according to his abilities,
to each according to his needs.” This is a main difference with
socialism, which seeks to close the gap between the rich and poor
through redistribution of wealth.

This is all sounds quaint and a bit nutty in the current age, but it
turns out these problems are going to be front and center in the diverse
future. If you listen to the diversity warriors, most of what they are
saying revolves around what Marxists would have called distributive
choices. Instead of thinking about the distribution of benefits based
along individual or class lines, like the communists, they think about
the problem along lines of group identity.

The logic flows from egalitarianism. If all people are equal, inequality
must be the result of something other than nature. Individual choice can
explain differences in individuals, but what explains measurable
differences in groups of people? The only option once you eliminate the
obvious is the structure of society itself. The reason blacks, for
example, are overrepresented in prison is the criminal justice system
distributes justice unequally between the races.

This is what the diversity warriors mean when they talk about whiteness
or white supremacy culture. These are the unwritten rules of society
that benefit one group over other groups. Since it is white societies
that make this form of madness possible, they naturally conclude that
white society is the problem. As insane as it is, the diversity warriors
are not irrational. From their starting premise, theirs is the only
rational answer for why we have inequality in our societies.

This is why conservatives are worthless against these arguments. Here is
a “conservative case for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”
<a href="https://archive.is/69QDM" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> in National Review that is a good example of
the problem. The author thinks there is some accommodation within his
conventional American view of politics for the politics of diversity. He
assumes that these people will accept equality of opportunity, when in
fact they view that argument as the problem they are seeking to
eliminate.

This is the central problem of diversity. Scarcity is a permanent
feature of all human societies, even wealthy ones. For example, there is
a finite amount of health care in America, which means some people get
less, maybe even no health care, while others get the heath care they
need. Since there are still some market forces at work, rich people will
get luxurious levels of health care. Dick Cheney, for example, was able
to buy a heart for himself.

Further, Mother Nature does not distribute her gifts equally among
people, so no two people are identical and no two groups of people are
equal. Combined with the scarcity problem, it means there will be an
unequal distribution of benefits between people and also groups of
people. Even more important, the more diverse your society, the less
equal the outcomes appear. The reason is there are lots of people with a
grievance for not being in the top group of society.

The way to think of it is this. In 1950’s America, blacks were a little
more than 10% of the population, while whites were a little less than
90%. There was a small percentage of Asians and other. In a world where
10% of the population has a racial grievance, most of the rest can
safely ignore the complaints. In a majority-minority society, the
majority always has a beef with the minority group at the top, so that
minority group must always be on guard against the majority.

This is why the arguments in favor of natural rights or equal
opportunity sound increasingly ridiculous to people who live in the
world. To conservatives they make perfect sense, because their income
depends upon maintaining these fictions. To the diversity warriors,
these arguments are confirmation that they have the morally superior
argument and therefore they are justified in pushing even harder. The
conservative case for diversity is exactly what it claims.

Instead of letting nature take its course, the Marxists imagined an
administrative state making the distributive choices. It was this
managerial layer that would determine “according to his needs” issue.
The diversity warriors have assumed control of the managerial state and
the corresponding administrative state. They are now proceeding to
remedy the equality problem. From each race according to their
abilities, to each race according to their needs.

Of course, this has no better chance of working than Marxism. Unlike
communism, however, this new egalitarian drive will not just make people
poorer. It will unleash the passions of cultural differences that cannot
be remedied. These differences are the product of thousands of years of
separation. This is ultimately the conservative case for diversity. It
promises to unleash 10,000 years of evolutionary differences within the
confines of Western societies.

This is what makes American conservatism so evil. It is the sugary drink
in which the poison of egalitarianism is dosed to society. The diversity
warriors believe they are on the side of angels, while the so-called
conservative know otherwise, but they choose to cash in on the madness.
The simpleton who wrote that NRO piece is too dumb to get this, but his
handlers surely know better. Yet, they volunteer to be the willing
accomplices to the executioners of Western civilization.
