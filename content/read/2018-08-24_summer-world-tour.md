As we head into the last week of summer, at least for most Americans, I
thought a survey of the world scene was a good idea this week. Here in
Lagos, it is the final week before the kids go back to school, so most
everyone is getting in some outdoor fun before it is too late. I’m
taking next week off so a show on lighter topics seems appropriate.
Plus, the political scene in America is so ugly right now, I need a
break from it. I think I will take a week off from consuming any news,
with regards to politics or current affairs.

I think the plan going forward will be to mix up the format each week.
One or two weeks will be the single topic type shows and the other weeks
will be the variety shows. The feedback on the format has been about
evenly split. Some prefer one style, while others prefer the other
format. You can’t please everyone, but mixing things up works for me, as
content is always a struggle. Sometimes the world is just not that
interesting, while other times it demands out attention. This way I keep
it interesting for me and for you.

I am looking forward to a bit of break. I don’t know about anyone else,
but the censorship, the deplatforming, the barking at the moon insanity
of the Left, all of it has really started to wear on me. I hate these
people. I hate them mostly because they force the rest of us to share in
their hatred. They could stew in their own juices, but instead they
demand the rest of us pay attention to them. While thoughts of the day
of the rope bring some pleasure, I really wish it did not have to come
to that, but that’s the future and we all know it.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
