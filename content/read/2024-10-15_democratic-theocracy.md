Iran has been in the news lately and one of the interesting things about
the coverage is Western media rarely talks about the president of Iran.
In fact, almost all Iran stories skip the president entirely. This is
highly unusual as Western media is conditioned to personify countries
that are out of favor. The bad country becomes the ruler of that country
and that ruler is always some form of Hitler. The closest they get with
Iran is using a picture of the supreme leader in the copy.

One reason for this is Iran is a complicated place and Western media
struggles with anything more complicated than the good guys versus bad
guys narrative. Despite what most think, Iranian politics has factions
and parties, with the winners being picked by the voters at fairly
normal elections. Those factions and parties argue about all the usual
things, including foreign policy. The current president ran on a
platform of improving relations with the rest of the world.

The funny thing about Iran is that it has avoided what has happened with
all prior revolutionary societies. They did not have rounds of purges or
a great terror in which a strongman consolidated power. There is no cult
of personality in the way most communist societies evolved. They are not
dogmatically attached to a narrow set of economic policies. Instead,
Iran has evolved into the world’s first explicitly democratic theocracy
based in its form of Islam.

At the top of Iranian society is the Supreme Leader. He is appointed by
the Assembly of Experts, who are elected to their positions. The
Guardian Council approves all candidates for elected office, including
those nominated to the Assembly of Experts, so the gatekeepers of
politics are the religious authorities. The result is a political system
that can debate and argue over public policy, but within the broad
religious framing of the Islamic authorities.

This is why the West often talks about Iran as if it is a medieval
society. In medieval Europe, the Church set the boundaries for secular
government. The King had to be in good standing with the Church, but the
Church needed to be in good standing with the king as he provided
security. From the perspective of “secular” societies in the West, the
Iranians have recreated a throne and altar society, something the West
abandoned in favor of reason and democracy.

The interesting thing about the criticism is it comes with some envy.
The managerial class of the West, especially in America, would probably
prefer the explicit relationship between the moral and the practical. In
Iran, if Islam forbids it, it is simply forbidden and that is the end of
it. In America, banning the discussion of crime stats is forbidden for
an extensive list of contradictory reasons sprinkled with magical
thinking about the reality of the human condition.

This may be why Iran avoided the cycle of violence and authoritarianism
that we expect to see with revolutionary societies. From the start, the
morality of the revolution had been resolved. The main task was to first
remove the prior regime and the Western influences that emanated from
it. Once the old regime was gone, there was no void where the old
morality existed, so there was no battle for who would decide how to
fill the void and with what to fill it.

This may explain some of the convulsions of the West. Christianity and
the carryover from it provided the moral center of the progressive
ideology. That slowly gave way to opposition to communism in the Cold
War. Once the great struggle had been won, there was no longer a moral
purpose to the progressive ideology. What flowed into it was whatever
was kicking around the institutions. Fringe lunacies suddenly had a
clear path to the center of the progressive moral universe.

Once again, we see that Marx was right about politics. At the highest
level, it is about the battle over moral questions. Once the moral
questions are answered, there is no need for this sort of politics.
Instead, politics is reduced to debates about how to address the mundane
practical issues of governance. For thirty years Iran has only had to
worry about defending itself from the West, while for the last thirty
years the West has been searching for a new god to replace the old one.

What you see in Iran is something the West cannot reconcile and that is
the limit of reason, which is the moral. The ideology of the West rests
on the assumption that all moral questions have a reasonable answer, so
all moral limits that cannot hold up to reason must be invalid. Iran
does not struggle with this dilemma, because the moral limits are beyond
question and they are right there in the Koran, as interpreted by the
religious authorities.

Put another way, what Iran has in excess is the answer to the two most
important questions for any society and they are “who says?” and “why
not?” The answer to both questions is well known to everyone in Iranian
society and therefore the questions never need to be asked. In the West,
there are no answers to those questions, so the closest we get to an
answer is the jungle of rules against discussing anything that
challenges the sensibilities of the managerial class.

What we see with the contrast between Iran and the West, particularly
America, is a contrast in two forms of democratic theocracy. Iran starts
with the issue of morality as a settled matter and implements democracy
as a means to sort practical ends. In the West, democracy is a moral end
in itself, but the result is endless debates over what will be
temporarily viewed as timeless truths. Iran is the mirror of American in
terms of the relationship between the moral and the political.

There are other reasons why Iran is what it is, not the least of which
is that it is full of Iranians who can date their society back to the
ancients. Islam also has a vastly different view of the natural world
than what evolved out of Christianity. Even so, the fact that Iran has
survived as a democratic theocracy provides a clue for how American
progressivism could survive as well. Otherwise, it shakes itself to
pieces searching for something to fill the void that lies at the center
of it.
