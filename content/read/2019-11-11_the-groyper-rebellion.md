The youthful rebellion against establishment gate keepers on the college
campus has mostly confirmed what has always been understood about the
front men hired to be the face of these operations. Never having to
answer tough questions allows them to fool people, especially young
people, about their motives. The questions young people are posing these
guys are not all that tough, but when posed to hot house flowers not
used to push-back, the result have been devastating.

The main take-away thus far is that Charlie Kirk is the political
equivalent of a lip-syncing pop star. In narrowly staged performances,
as long as the sound track works perfectly and the lights are just
right, Kirk can put on a good show. When he has to rely on his own
talent to carry the show, the results are comically poor. He was
recently <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">booed off the stage</a> at his
UCLA event. Like that lip-syncing pop star, who gets exposed during a
stage mishap, Kirk’s career is now a laughingstock.

Kirk, of course, is not the only fraudster to get the business from the
groypers, as it has now become the cool thing to do. Matt Walsh of The
Daily Wire, who is always a skipped pill away from a shooting spree,
<a href="https://twitter.com/NickerNation/status/1191866837547532291"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to be sedated</a> after
getting some tough questions from college boys. The cynical con-man Dan
Crenshaw has responded by <a
href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/dan-crenshaw-threatens-america-first-students-at-campus-event-you-are-being-filmed-and-youre-going-to-regret-this/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatening to ruin the
lives</a> of these kids. It appears that Pirate Dan is trying to prove
that honorable military service is independent of good character.

The most interesting result thus far has been
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLAh_pOGOrc"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the meltdown by Ben
Shapiro</a> last week, which was so bad he had to pull it from his
YouTube channel. The comments were full of young people mocking him.
Shapiro is probably the smartest of the con-men deployed by Conservative
Inc., but he is also the most thin-skinned. Any push-back is met with a
childish tantrum. Like Charlie Kirk, it suggests he is a hothouse
flower, carefully protected by his handlers, in order to maintain the
charade.

If you pay attention to his act, what comes through is he has a deep,
subconscious hatred of white people. Take for example his promotion of
the dubious claim that European civilization is defined by
Judeo-Christian tradition. For most of Western history, Christianity and
Judaism were at odds. In the early
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=18424"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">medieval period</a>, Jews and
Christians competed for converts. When the term Judeo-Christian came
into use in the 17th and 18th century, it was as a Pauline pejorative
against Catholicism.

Putting aside the history, what he is doing is rewriting the European
past in order to make it dependent on his religious and ethnic
traditions. You can have your Christianity, as long as it is accepting
of Jews, which neuters the theologically. You can also have your Western
chauvinism, as long as you make sure Jews are central characters in the
narrative. Ben Shapiro’s view of Western civilization is colonial, as if
he is allowing white people to have some conditional cultural heritage.

This becomes clear when
<a href="https://twitter.com/RussianBotFren/status/1192692429998178304"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shapiro says</a> “white
civilization is nonsensical.” He says that “civilization is defined by
culture, history and philosophy.” He is divorcing what he calls Western
civilization from the people who created it. Like his sleight of hand
swapping out Catholicism from the heart of European history, he is
turning Western civilization into a gift inexplicably granted to the
people of Europe. It is not something European people created, but
something they received, like hitting the lottery.

There is an obvious implication to this train of thought. If white
people are just lucky recipients of civilization, then they are not
really deserving of it. This would explain Shapiro’s love for non-white
immigration. Why shouldn’t everyone get a taste of this civilization
thing? It’s only fair. When <a
href="https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/875730927002963968?lang=en"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he says</a> “he does not give
a good damn about the so-called browning of America,” he is not entirely
honest. In fact, he really cares, as he is in total support of it as an
act of retributive justice.

You can never know what is in someone’s heart and it is entirely
possible that Shapiro has not thought through any of this. It is
increasingly clear that he is clever, but not a deep thinker. He
possesses a vermin-like rapacity that is often mistaken for smart and
ambitious in this degraded age. His act is therefore about presenting
himself as a smart guy, who just happens to agree with an audience
desperate to throw money at anyone showing them some respect. He’s just
working the suckers.

Either way, the fact that these guys have no prepared responses to these
questions has some larger implications. It is important the keep in mind
that the same people bankrolling Shapiro and Kirk and all the rest are
also bankrolling versions of these guys on the Left. Both sides of the
Progressive morality play are financed by the same amorphous donor class
that also underwrites the Imperial Capital. These morality plays are
always the product of the Cloud People to control the Dirt People.

This stuff suggests the divide between the Cloud People and Dirt People
has grown to a point where neither side really understands the other.
The people behind these shows have no idea what’s going on among the hoi
polloi. Similarly, the rabble is baffled as to why these people don’t
address the questions being raised. Much of the success of this
rebellion is due to the groypers assuming their targets were smart and
prepared, so they prepared great questions and great logistics.

One thing that is true about revolutions, at least in the West, is that
long before the crisis in the streets, there is a quiet divorce between
the people and their rulers. The people in charge stop knowing or even
respecting the people over whom they rule, while the people lose their
connection to their rulers. It is this connection, this set of
reciprocal obligations rooted in blood and history that sees a people
and their rulers through crisis. Once it is gone, the next crisis
becomes a revolution.

When even
<a href="https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1193664122698838019"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a guy</a>, who is desperately
trying to be the voice of the Dirt People inside the Imperial Capital,
is all thumbs on the youth revolt, it says they are flying blind. Gaetz
posted his support for the Cloud and hour later he is rushing to qualify
that tweet, because his staff noticed the reaction. When the Tribune of
the Dirt People instinctively sides with the Cloud People, the gap
between us them and them has probably reached a point where it can never
be bridged. What comes next is inevitable.
