People dismiss Elizabeth Warren as a light weight who got a little
lucky. That may be true to a great degree, but she is an ambitious light
weight. She wants to be the first fake Indian in the White House. She
has carefully staked out the right turf and is a favorite of the hard
bourgeois Left. When she was running for the Senate, middle-class women
were ecstatic for her. Warren’s Facebook page has that cultish vibe to
it. It is the sort of fawning that makes normal people uncomfortable.

Today comes news she is <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prepping a book</a> for later
in the year. This is a common thing for pols with an eye on a
presidential run. They are written to make life easy for the press
covering them. Well, easier for the liberal press swooning over a
Democrat candidate. Republicans tend to write books that are used as
ammunition against them, because Republicans are dumb. Warren’s next
book smells like a campaign platform that her friends in the media can
use to promote her candidacy.

The conventional wisdom is Clinton will run away with the 2016
nomination. It is her turn and she has dirt on everyone that could run
against her. The Democrats usually abhor retreads and losers, but their
bench is empty right now. Warren could probably challenge Clinton as
both the authentic Progressive and the authentic Progressive women in
the race. There’s a lot of bad feeling toward Clinton from the Left, but
running against someone with Clinton’s body count is not wise.

In Washington it is an open secret that Warren is quietly feeling out
supporters and donors. Hillary is old and looking rough. If she falters,
Warren is going to want to be ready. Publishing a book no one will read
is another way to touch the donor base. They will be asked to buy in
bulk. If after the midterm the Party is looking for someone around whom
they can rally, Warren could be right there to play the Bobby Kennedy
role to Hillary’s Humphrey. If not, then 2020 is a possibility.

The thing that no one sees coming is the growing populism in the
country. Someone on the Right may figuring it out, as the GOP is a
fragile shell of a party. That said, the nation is led by the Left, so
that’s where populism will have a real impact if it becomes a thing in
politics. Warren is someone who could tap into that and become the new
face of bourgeois Progressivism. That assumes that Hillary does not run
and win and Hillary does not have these challengers killed.
