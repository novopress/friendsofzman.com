As I was recording the show, news broke that one of the DOGE kids was
doxed by an Antifa working for the Wall Street Journal. This is a bit
ironic in that the crux of the USAID scandal is the nexus between the
government, the vast network of not-for-profits, the media, and the
activists. The money flowing around this system is what has made the
last decade of domestic terrorism possible.

To emphasize the point, the activist in question was an employee at
USAID before they literally paid for her to go to graduate school at
Columbia. How exactly that worked is unclear, but that is what people on
Twitter have unearthed. Such an arrangement would not be shocking, given
the amount of money being pumped into the Radical Industrial Complex
through the federal budget.

The fact that the Wall Street Journal is engaging in this behavior is
another reminder that “conservatism” was part of the fraud. The kabuki
theater of right versus left in our politics was always a fraud on the
public, particularly the white middle-class, who were and remain the
backbone of the country. The theater of democracy was intended to keep
them bought in while they were dispossessed.

It also reveals that what we call the left is entirely artificial.
Without the hundreds of billions from your pocket, it would barely
exist. Like the progressive programs of the past, this system has
cultivated generations of welfare queens to the point where they
literally cannot exist without the system. Break the flow of cash into
this system and it will collapse and take it bizarre faith with it.

While the week’s news has been both amusing and frustrating, it is
important to remember that this is the final struggle for civilization.
If the Musk team can break up the money flow, the crazies will be
defeated, and society can be rebuilt. If they fail and the crazies win,
then at best we get tanks in the streets. The Radical Industrial Complex
is Skynet, and the only way forward is for it to be destroyed.
