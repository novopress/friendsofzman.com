The show this week is on a topic that comes up here in different ways
from time to time but will become more of a focus in the future. That
topic is the intellectual and spiritual underpinnings of the new
religion. Our side has the bad habit of judging this stuff by objective
standards, which has some minor utility, but is of no use in developing
suitable defenses or an alternative moral philosophy.

The first step in that process is the same as in war, which is to
reconnoiter the enemy in order to understand his strengths and
weaknesses. In the sense of the culture war, that means going into the
enemy’s intellectual territory to understand how they think and get a
grip on their code. Every subculture has its own language and the new
religion is not an exception. They have their own jargon which we have
to learn.

This parallel language is not just something they use in private with
other cult members, but part of their everyday lives. What makes it
effective is that the objects of their wrath are ignorant to the secret
meanings. The enemies of the new religion still rely on dictionaries for
words like race and sex. As a result, normal people are ignorant of the
scheming that is often happening in plain sight.

As an aside, this is why the hard-thumping believers spend a lot of time
cooking up imaginary code words used by their imaginary enemies. In the
Charlottesville trial, the plaintiffs brought in a psychic to explain
various internet memes. Projection is a big part of the new religion, so
they assume that their enemies, real and imaginary, are speaking in
coded language just as is done by the Left.

That said, dissidents do rely on coded language and esoteric language to
communicate in the public square. Otherwise, the usual suspects would
have an easy time of rounding up their opponents. In fact, every post
here contains coded messages embedded in the text, along with the key
for decoding them. The key, of course, changes every day and is why
there are no Saturday posts.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
