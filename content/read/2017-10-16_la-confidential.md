A popular topic of conversation on the Dissident Right is the imagined
future the Cloud People have planned for us. The word “Brazilification”
gets thrown around a lot. Going by mass media, the future will be
populated by hairless, caramel colored mulattoes and Asians. That’s
unlikely, but the majority-minority future is inevitable. That means
America will be a very different place in another generation. Just look
how fast Los Angeles went from being surf city to a sprawling version of
Tijuana.

Digging around in Baltimore City arrest data last week, I got curious
about what other cities had exposed their arrests data to public
download. There’s not a lot of consistency, as this appears to be a new
project. My guess is some company has figured out how to game the
Federal grant system and they are helping cities upgrade their IT
systems with Federal dollars. Anyway, I found a data set from the Los
Angeles police department that is pretty big. It is their arrest data
going back to 2010.

Los Angeles is a city of 3,884,307 people. Since the start of 2010, the
LAPD has made 1,146,393 arrests, which is roughly 450 arrests per day.
That’s an interesting figure, given that LA has a relatively low
homicide rate of 6.7. Baltimore has a murder rate nine times higher, but
an arrest rate just 10% higher than Los Angeles, when adjusting for
differences in population. Maybe it is just the nice weather that makes
people less inclined to homicide one another. Or, it could be the
population mix. Here are the demographics of LA.

Los Angeles not only has a relatively small black population, it has a
much larger Asian population than you see in most cities. In fact, Los
Angeles is an interesting mix, because it is one of the few
majority-minority cities. It’s also a large city so the sample size is
very big. A boutique college town with lots of diversity is not going to
tell us much about our multicultural future, despite what the Cloud
People may think. Here’s the break down of arrest per population group.

The law abiding Asians make up for a lot of black crime when you look at
the data. The cool thing about the Los Angeles arrest data is they go
further than most cities in identifying the ethnicity of the offender.
That’s probably something we will see everywhere as America gets less
white. The old way of counting white and non-white only made sense when
America was mostly white. In the Cloud People paradise, every group gets
a classification in the system. Here’s a break down of Asians into their
known groups.

Of course, the fun begins when we start to look at homicide numbers.
Here’s the break out of murder related offenses by race

What’s interesting is that Hispanics are not over represented in overall
arrest data, compared to their share of the population, but they are
over performing in the violent crime area. That’s probably due to the
drug trade, but that is a guess. The arrest breakout also helps when
trying to parse Hispanic whites from non-Hispanic whites in national
crime figures. Of course, the old familiar pattern of black violent
crime is present in the LA numbers. Blacks are 10% of the population and
36% of murder related arrests.

Here’s the break out by age.

Here’s the arrest by day. It seems that warmer areas have a flatter
curve on this for some reason. Maybe cold weather alters police behavior
in some way or maybe criminals prefer mild weather. At some point, once
I have a enough data from different regions, I’ll do a degree day
calculation on arrests to see if there is a correlation. That would
maybe say something about police habits.. Doing the same day for day of
the crime would maybe say something about the behavior of criminals. Or
maybe not.

One interesting thing in the LA data is the number of old people in the
arrest data. There are 48 arrest records for nonagenarians. Two were
homicides, which is incredible. Even more amazing is 15 arrests were for
drunkenness. Maybe this is not so odd, as alcohol related offenses are
the third most common arrest code in the system. Drugs are number two
with Miscellaneous being the top reason to arrest someone. This is a
pattern I saw in the Baltimore data. The arrests codes are not well
maintained or enforced.

Here is a break down of arrest codes.

What becomes clear when looking at the Los Angeles crime data is that de
facto segregation is a fact of life in a majority minority city. When
you break it out by race and area, you don’t have to know a thing about
LA to see the pattern. The other thing is Hispanics bring elevated
levels of crime, but not the rates you see with black. It’s one reason
the Cloud People like Hispanic migration. They get all the benefit of a
servant population, without the headaches that come with Africans.

The other interesting thing about Los Angeles is that it is
majority-minority, but whites control the political system. <a
href="https://www.lacity.org/your-government/elected-officials/city-council/council-directory"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Look at the city council</a>. It’s mighty
white for a place with just a 30% white population. The truth is,
Hispanics are not a group with a real identity. That’s just a made up
thing by Progs. Mexicans from the north have little in common with
Guatemalans or even Mexicans from the south. This makes forming a
unified coalition that can punch commensurate with its weight nearly
impossible.

That’s another reason the Cloud People have no fear of migration. So
far, it has not cut into their authority. If anything, it makes it
easier for them to deal with blacks and troublesome whites. Progs are
diluting black influence in their coalition with Hispanics and they are
replacing the white working class with them. The Hispanic laboring class
makes fewer demands and is far less organized. They may not be reliable
voters, but they are cheap voters, relative to working class whites.
That’s the way it works for now.
