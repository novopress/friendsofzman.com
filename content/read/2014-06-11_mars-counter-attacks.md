A long time ago a man named
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Francis"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samuel T. Francis</a> was
writing for various conservative publications about Middle American
Radicals. The essay in which he laid out his ideas can be found <a
href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9VGdzQAgkCYC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=mars%27s+attacks+sam+francis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CVrjvKIAoh&amp;sig=vSQZkr5ShzCqiTxfRITcjug_UPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_zGYU57WCufesASJ1IGQDg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mars%27s%20attacks%20sam%20francis&amp;f=false"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Sam Francis was a
great thinker, who has been flushed down the memory hole by the
Conservative Inc.. Even the neo-reactionaries of the Dark Enlightenment
seem to have forgotten about him, if they ever heard of him. It is a
pity, he was truly a brilliant thinker on the Right.

If Sam were alive today he would be chuckling at the results of last
night’s election in Virginia. Official Washington is busy interpreting
the results in a self-serving way, but that’s to be expected. The ruling
class hate you. Middle America has been their enemy for so long they no
longer recall why. They simply know their guy was thrown out of office
by the voters in favor of a guy who sounds like Pat Buchanan. There has
to be a reason that does not indicate failure on their part.

Our rulers are just as afraid of reality as the rest of us. The
managerial class has developed a number of coping strategies to explain
away anything the suggests their position is anything other than
legitimate. By the weekend, they will be out blaming this on racists,
who oppose  immigration and Tea Party bogeymen. Some of the posts in <a
href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/06/the-economics-of-brat.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this thread</a> give a clue as
to how the Left will respond. We also see some hints of how suicidal
libertarians will react.

There’s no escaping the fact that immigration and its impact on the
middle-class was the key issue. The middle-class in America, by that I
mean outside the coastal hipster enclaves, has endured a long hard slog
since the crash. It was not exactly good times in the Bush years. The
assault on decency and basic civilization that we see from the Obama
administration is looking like the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
The middle is now ready to throw off their technocratic managers,
regardless of party.

What we see in this race is that an articulate and intelligent candidate
picked up on the issues that have been out there for over a decade now.
The Tea Party tapped into some of it, but it was crushed by the
establishment crooks that attached to it. It was also plagued by the
problem all insurgent movements face. It attracted fringe nuts and
weirdos. Too many of them carried the Tea Party banner to prominence,
thus making it easy for the Left to disparage the movement.

The issues remain. Middle class people don’t want to see the nation
flooded with South American peasants. They don’t want their jobs sent to
Pakistan because Mark Zuckerburg needs a new Ferrari. They don’t want to
turn on their TV and see men dressed as girls openly talking about
sodomy. What ever their reservations, they don’t want to see their old
church bulldozed to make way for an abortion mill. Middle America is not
ready to march off to the camps as the managerial class hopes.

Brat is a normal guy who tapped into these issues and beat a very
well-financed establishment guy. Enterprising pols with similar skill
should take note. Democrats may be cheering, but there’s an element in
their own ranks that shares the same values as the voters who tossed out
Cantor. It is why Hillary Clinton plans to run in 2016 as a populist.
That’s the source of the <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“dead broke” comments</a> the
other day. She’s working on her shtick. They may be vulgarians, but the
Clintons are not stupid.
