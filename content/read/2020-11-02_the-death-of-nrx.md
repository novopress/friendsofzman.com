------------------------------------------------------------------------

A decade ago the left-libertarian, Arnold Kling, coined the term
“neo-reactionary” to describe the on-line community calling itself the
*Dark Enlightenment*. These were mostly fans of the blogger Curtis
Yarvin, writing under the name Moldbug, but there were others writing
about the same ideas. English philosopher Nick Land added some academic
legitimacy to the project. He was the first person to use the term *Dark
Enlightenment* in an essay of the same name.

In many respects, neo-reaction was a forerunner of the alt-right
movement, in that it made on-line politics fun and interesting to a
growing number of young white males dissatisfied with conventional
politics. Reading the blogs and participating in the communities turned
esoteric topics into a sense of community. Later, the alt-right would
follow the same model, drawing in young white males around a more
simplistic critique of modern liberal democracy and multiculturalism.

Of course, the alt-right also followed neo-reaction into obscurity.
Almost all of the sites and characters from neo-reaction have either
moved onto to other things or disappeared entirely. Curtis Yarvin has
moved into the nationalist camp, writing for more mainstream sites. Nick
Land has moved onto other things, having been exiled from the academy
for holding unpopular opinions on taboo subjects. No one flies the
neo-reaction or Dark Enlightenment flag these days.

While it is easy to see how the alt-right collapsed, the failure of the
neo-reaction movement is a bit of a puzzler. Most of the bigger names
writing on those topics were sensible about what they were doing. They
avoided the media and did not have delusions of grandeur like so many in
the alt-right. They were happy to stick to their blogs and forums. They
even tried to practice good optics by avoiding the spicy language that
is common in right-wing forums.

The first problem with neo-reaction, the one that probably led it down a
dead end, is that they never got to the heart of the problem of
democracy. They were good at criticizing egalitarianism and
multiculturalism, but those are the leaves, not the roots of the problem
of modern liberal democracy. Like all right-wing movements, they made
the mistake of thinking that facts and careful analysis would be enough
to counter the moral arguments that are the power source of liberal
democracy.

Montesquieu observed that the engine of aristocracy in honor, while the
engine of despotism is fear. In a republic, it is virtue. The citizen of
the republic respects the logic of the political order and the
institutions that maintain it. In liberal democracy, the engine is civic
morality. Everything must point toward that vaguely understood sense
that the arc of history bends toward the perfectly egalitarian society.
Anything that opposes this, even reality itself, is assumed to be the
enemy of democracy.

Another big problem for the neo-reactionaries is they often sounded like
young men who spent too much time playing video games. Their image of
aristocracy often sounded like escapism, rather than serious politics.
Then you had the writing style of Curtis Yarvin, which gave the movement
a cult like vibe. The meandering and cryptic writing style along with
the insider language was more about building a cult of personality than
trying to fill out an alternative set of political beliefs.

Probably the thing that did the movement in was the embrace of the term
neo-reaction, which allowed the Left to define the movement. This is how
the Left steals the moral high ground. They assume they are on the right
side of history, following the arc to the final destination of society.
Anyone that disagrees is a reactionary. The opposition is not based in
logic, but in fear and ignorance. This recasts the dispute as good
versus evil, smart versus dumb and moral versus amoral.

This is the reason that what we call the Left in America has gone from
triumph to triumph since Gettysburg. Holding the moral high ground
allows them to frame every argument without having to establish their
claims. The choice of the opposition is to accept it and try to find a
way to achieve other ends using liberal morality or simply leave the
field entirely. The latter is what neo-reaction argued, if not directly,
then indirectly through its escapism.

Neo-reaction largely petered out when the big names could not figure out
where to go with it. Yarvin dropped out to make money in Silicon Valley
and has now re-spawned as a nationalist. Land moved onto
accelerationism, while others have moved back to the conventional Right.
Much like the right-libertarianism of Hans Hermann-Hoppe and the
citizenism of Steve Sailer, these ideas can only work if the Left goes
along with them, which can never happen as long as the Left exists.

That said, these failed efforts are useful to anyone working toward an
alternative to the prevailing orthodoxy. We learn more from failure than
success. What all efforts to counter the Left have in common is the
failure to appreciate that they faced a moral framework, not a set of
ideas. You don’t talk people out of their beliefs. Instead, you offer a
better set of beliefs, a better moral framework, one that allows them to
believe they are on the side of angels.
