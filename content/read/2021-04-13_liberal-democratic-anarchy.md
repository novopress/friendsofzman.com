In theory, the difference between mob rule and liberal democracy is that
the former operates outside of authority, while the latter is limited by
a set of principles. The former is operating in the moment while the
latter is deliberative. Instead of just doing what feels right in the
moment, like exacting revenge, liberal democracy has processes and
limits, forcing people to think about what they are doing before they
act. It is majority rule slowed to a crawl by the ideals of western
liberalism.

The problem is that liberal democracy is an industrial age political
philosophy that is unsuited for the technological age. Fifty years ago,
information flowed primarily by words on a page, carried around by men.
Television and radio sped up the flow of information, but the
information still got into those networks by foot. Before it could be on
television, someone had to go out to the scene, make video, carry it
back to the studio and then edit it. It was still a slow world.

Today, information flows at the speed of light. A conspiracy theory can
be hatched and promoted to millions on-line in a matter of minutes. As
the old expression goes, a lie is around the world before the truth is
out of bed. It is why the race hoax has become a phenomenon of this age.
By the time the truth of the incident has been revealed, we are onto the
third or fourth race hoax. These stories collectively build up in the
system to the point where they cumulatively become a truth of their own.

An easy example is the Chauvin case. There are people absolutely sure he
stood on the man’s neck for nine minutes. They were convinced of this by
the bombardment of lies they experienced on-line. They never bothered to
watch the whole video when it was finally released. Why would they? They
knew and everyone around them knew that Chauvin stood on Floyd’s neck
until he suffocated. It is just another example of racist cops murdering
an innocent black body for the crime of being black.

In a mass media society like ours, there can be no deliberation, so the
psychology is that of the mob, not liberal democracy. There can be no
concern for limits and process, as we are all forced to decide by those
around us on-line. That is what happens in a mob of people excited by
some event. As with a school of fish or a flock of birds, each person is
responding to the actions of those around him. Mob psychology is an
emergent property that transcends the mentality of the members.

A very good example is the behavior of corporate America. Supposedly,
the heads of the largest corporations have been plotting to undermine
what is left of election integrity in America. They had a “first of its
kind” [conference
call](https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1381362593017819141) about
Georgia. They were compelled to act because, well, everyone around them
is sure that Georgia has just reinstituted Jim Crow. They know this
because everyone around them knows this and all of those people are good
people like them.

We live in an age in which the most powerful people on the planet, some
are the most powerful who have lived on this planet, truly feel they are
in a twilight struggle against forces greater than themselves. The heads
of the big banks think they are the little guy facing off against some
invisible goliath. Others helpfully anthropomorphize it with pictures of
people waving Trump signs. The insurrection hoax is all about validating
the very real fear of the most powerful people on the planet.

This is the psychology of the mob. Whatever drove the people to show up
on the street is soon confirmed and becomes the identity of the whole.
The individual shows up because he is angry about something. Quickly he
is just another corpuscle in the organism that is the collective anger
of the members. He is now swept up in the mob, like a cork on an angry
sea. Even though he could have real power in his own right, he feels
powerless as a part of the mob swarming around him.

This is liberal democracy in the technological age. Democracy cloaks the
people who are naturally in charge of society with the concept of the
public will. Public policy is not the result of one man or a group of
men, it is democracy. The price and supply of goods is not the result of
decisions made by specific people, but by the invisible hand of the
marketplace responding to millions of silent decisions. In a democracy,
no one is responsible, because everyone is responsible, so no one is
accountable.

In the slow motion world of the industrial age, this headless system can
work reasonably well because people have time to stop and think. In the
technological age, where no one can think about anything, cooler heads
are trampled into the dust by mobs pushed along by forces external to
themselves. Worse still, the mob mentality is amplified, so it is not
just a mob, but a deafening mob. Those will real power fear the mob, so
they lend their power to the mob.

Critics looking at what is happening, assume the people in charge, the
people with real power, see some benefit in the chaos. Like liberal
democracy, bourgeois objectivism is an artifact of a bygone age.  In the
technological age, the age of instant communication, the mob mentality
is what prevails. What is good for the individual is no different than
what is good for a liver cell. Individual good is subsumed into the
emergent properties of the whole and the mentality of the individual is
the mentality of the mob.

So much of what is happening today is just a replay of mistakes made a
generation ago, often by people still in power. The assault on law and
order is right out of the cultural revolution of the 1960’s. Most of the
people in charge today were young adults back in those days. They should
have the wisdom to see what is happening, but they care caught up in the
moment like everyone else. They don’t feel like they have power, so they
act like they are as powerless as the rest of us.

Liberal democracy in the technological age results in anarchy and mob
rule. The consequences are inevitable. America is shaking itself to
death over problems that could be mitigated with a little deliberation
and respect for limits. No one has time for that as there is always
another crisis, another mob demanding immediate attention for the object
of their rage. Mob rule always ends in blood, either the blood of the
mob or the blood of the innocent. This age most likely ends in both.
