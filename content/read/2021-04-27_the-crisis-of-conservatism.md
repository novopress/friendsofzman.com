One of the subplots to the ongoing crisis in America is how various
voices within official conservatism are struggling to come to terms with
it. In the last years of the Obama administration, they were sure they
had a good read on things. Their turn to run the system was coming up
and they were busy getting their resumes ready for jobs within the next
Republican administration. Then their plans took a direct hit from their
own voters in 2016 and their thing has been taking on water ever since.

The neoconservatives, with their vermin-like rapacity, continue to focus
on their project, regardless of what is happening. That means
infiltrating the Biden administration through the foreign policy
establishment and promoting the old-time religion through proxies like
Liz Cheney and Lindsey Graham. It also means rooting out populists from
the Republican ranks. From their perspective, the chaos is just another
opportunity to warp the political process to their advantage.

The other side of official conservatism, the civic nationalist wing,
finds itself a stranger in its own movement. The people they were sure
they represented turned on them in the 2016 primary and remain hostile.
The big stars of “right-wing” media now sound like Pat Buchanan, rather
than Bill Buckley. Tucker Carlson is the biggest voice in official
conservatism and he sounds like the people Conservative Inc ran out of
their thing back in the 1980’s. Conservatism has an identity crisis.

Part of that identity crisis is the collapse of intellectual capital.
The best minds on the Right are either in the grave or outside of
official conservatism. Look around the organs of official conservatism
and it is mostly kids repeating the old clichés. The rest are time
servers who made their career by avoiding anything difficult. Part of
the crisis is that there is no one around with the courage to question
the orthodoxy or the grounding in political history to contextualize the
current crisis.

The result is weird analysis like
<a href="https://archive.is/Jt2oh" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this</a> from guys like David Brooks, arguing that the
solution is to attack the people now abandoning conservatism.
“Republicans and conservatives who believe in the liberal project need
to organize and draw a bright line between themselves and the illiberals
on their own side.” Those “illiberals” he claims, will “eventually turn
to the strong man to salve the darkness and chaos inside themselves.”
That’s paranoid madness, not analysis..

A <a href="https://archive.ph/Qn0nq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less
deranged analysis</a> comes from fellow Times man, Ross Douthat, who
seems to have spent some time listening to the swelling ranks to his
Right. He points out that conservatives don’t conserve anything. This is
an old observation of dissidents, going back to before Trump ran for
president. Douthat repeats many familiar claims by dissidents about how
liberal democracy destroys family, tradition and community, before it
then consumes the ancient liberties it is supposed to defend.

Then Douthat inadvertently reveals the nature of the crisis within
conservatism by framing what he thinks is the list of currents tearing
through the Right. “*What are we actually conserving anymore?* is the
question, and the answers range from the antiquarian (the Electoral
College!) to the toxic (a white-identitarian conception of America) to
the crudely partisan (the right to gerrymander) to the most basic and
satisfying: Whatever the libs are against, we’re for.”

You cannot help but note that the one item on the list with any
intellectual and popular vigor is identified as immoral. He uses the
language of the Left to describe demographic realism as off limits.
Maybe it is the need to signal his obedience to the Left or a genuine
embrace of progressive morality, but the default position of the modern
conservative is to treat demographics as automatically immoral. They
rule out the problem when discussing the solution to the crisis.

The specter haunting conservatism is the specter of demographic reality,
the same specter that is haunting America and the West. So-called
conservatives like Douthat refuse to acknowledge it. In fact, they say
it is “toxic” to point out that America will soon be a majority nonwhite
country. The reason this bit of observable reality is toxic to
professional conservatives is that the Progressives say it is toxic.
They have anathematized any discussion of demographics.

The conservative political theorist Russel Kirk wrote, “A people’s
historic continuity of experience, says the conservative, offers a guide
to policy far better than the abstract designs of coffee-house
philosophers.” The only way there can be a “people’s historic continuity
of experience” is if the people actually exist. At its core,
conservativism has always been about preserving the people, not their
stuff. Once you stop conserving the people, conservatism is just an
ornament in the liberal democratic garden.

Modern conservatives, rather than defending the historic American
nation, defend the liberal democratic process. No matter the ends that
result from that process, conservatives believe they must defend the
process. The result has been a couple of generations of politics where
one side defends the process while the other side works to subvert it
for short term gain. Conservatives end up defending those subversions
and the perversions they create become conservative principles.

Both Brooks and Douthat wonder if conservatism can exist within liberal
democracy, but neither is willing to consider both answers to that
question. They just assume the answer is it can, so the project is to
figure out how. That blindness shows that conservatism cannot exist
within liberal democracy. It must yield to the morality of liberal
democracy, which will always be controlled by those who are able to
muster fifty percent plus one in favor of the morality they favor.

The crisis of modern conservatism is that conservatism must begin and
end with the conservation of the people. What conservatism has become is
a conservation of a system that is literally destroying the people who
created it. Worse yet, it has become a defense of a moral framework that
is the enemy of the fundamental conservative tenet that there is an
enduring moral order. Conservatism is either the opponent of liberal
democracy as practiced, or it is the tool of it.

The death of modern conservatism, and its morally ambiguous traveling
partner libertarianism, is a necessary step toward a genuine
alternative. It is only when the fight steps out from the prevailing
moral framework of egalitarianism and the blank slate that politics can
return to a debate about what is in the best interest of the people. At
that point, liberal democracy recedes, and the role of leaders is to
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
