rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reading reports such as this one</a>, my
first thought is Chuck Schumer really loves rubbing their noses in it.
He knows Boehner is a pussy and he enjoys pushing him around like a
schoolyard bully. He also hates normal Americans and so he is taking
pleasure in telling us that we have no say in the immigration fight. He
and the rest of the ruling class will open the flood gates and there is
nothing more to discuss. Maybe it is something else, but it just feels
like gloating. He also enjoys being a dickhead in public.

Of course, he could just be a jerk in real life, but clever politicians
don’t do anything without reason. Schumer is either trying to depress
the opposition or rally his supporters. He does not order breakfast
without having some scheme behind it. People forget that politics is
hard, even at the lower ranks. To get to where he is, while lacking
anything that resembles charm, means he is a brilliant political
athlete. Whatever he is saying in public, has a purpose and his ends are
always at odds with the interests of heritage Americans.

The shocking thing is the staggering stupidity of the GOP leaders. When
this started, everyone knew what was happening. The Senate would pass
amnesty. That way it would be on the table, not matter what came out of
the House. That was the threat. The point was to discourage the House
from taking up the issue. Otherwise, the two bills would be combined
into amnesty plus whatever the House supported.. Boehner publicly stated
that this was going to happen unless the House refused to pass a bill.

The GOP base is fuming over it and will bolt the party if it happens.
Boehner will probably lose his job if he is voluntarily walks into such
a trap. They will lose the House and probably the 2016 election.
Millions of white voters have abandoned politics because they have no
party. Millions more will follow suit, if the GOP becomes handmaiden of
the non-white party. This is obvious to anyone paying attention, which
is why Romney somehow managed to lose to a very vulnerable Barak Obama.
But, stupid people do stupid things.
