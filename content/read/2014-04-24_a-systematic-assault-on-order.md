Inflection points in a culture are not always obvious. In the 1970’s the
political culture changed in America, but not everyone was seeing it.
Nixon, who relied on the same political tactics used by both parties
through most of the 20th century found himself standing on shifting
ground. Johnson and Kennedy, after all, played dirty tricks and used the
power of their office to help their election chances. Kennedy beat Nixon
because the Illinois Democratic machine rigged the election.

Then all of a sudden the rules no longer applied to Nixon and he was
hounded from office. The press was not going to merely be an observer of
the battles. They were now part of the fight. Ever since it has been
axiomatic that the press is liberal and has different rules for covering
Republicans and Democrats. The new rules were in place and everyone in
the political class had to adapt to those new rules.

In the 1990’s, the political culture changed again. The Republicans had
caught up to the Democrats and were winning a lot of elections. The
response from Democrats was public relations. The lesson they learned
from Reagan was that a good presentation can change minds, even if the
argument was flawed. Since they were convinced Reagan was a loon, the
only explanation for his success was the presentation.

The Clinton years gave us “spin”, which is just a nice word for
baldfaced lying. An army of “spinners” were sent onto TV to tell one
whopper after another, often violating the rules of decorum that had
prevailed in public affairs broadcasting for decades. Just as important,
the liberal press had to be aggressively partisan. It was no longer
enough to be biased. They had to aggressively campaign for their side,
even if it meant destroying their own credibility.

I think we will look back and see the Bush years as when it became OK to
assault the basic institutions of democracy. In the Bush years, the need
for vote reform became a hot topic on the Right. The reason is ballot
stuffing operations kept turning up all over the country. The left was
furiously trying to sign up illegal aliens to vote and the Right was
furiously trying to pass laws to stop them.

By the Obama years, nationwide voter fraud schemes like ACORN were in
league with major Democratic financial operations like the SEIU. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> is just another
example of how much abuse has crept back into the system as the Left
tries to get around the limits of public tolerance for their madness. Of
course, open borders makes stuffing the ballot box that much easier, as
it provides unlimited stupid people.

That’s just one type of abuse. You also have organizations busing around
bums and Latinos to vote at multiple locations. The Left cross-checks
the death certificates with the voter rolls and suddenly they have
thousands of new votes wherever they need them. This is nothing new, of
course. Liberal Democrats have been stuffing the ballot box since the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19th century.</a> Today they
have better data and better tools to do it. Still, the outright contempt
for the idea of self-governance is what’s appalling.

When you look at the serial abuses from the Obama administration that
the press shrugs at now, it is fair to say the ground has shifted once
again. Instead of ritualized combat between citizens, who agree on the
big issues, American politics is looking more like a gang fight. There
are no rules, just what you can get away with. Whatever respect the
ruling class had for the institutions of the republic is now gone.

What will come next is the security agencies like the NSA, FBI and CIA
getting into the political process like we saw with the IRA. When
politics is a pirate ship, then the rules don’t matter. What matters is
how you use the weapons you have at your disposal. The political class
is looking like a Mafia family now. Soon, a Republican president is
going to learn like Nixon that the old rule don’t apply.
