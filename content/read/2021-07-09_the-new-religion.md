A common scene in the early medieval period was the whole village being
rounded up and brought down to the nearest river to be baptized. Their
lord had recently converted to the new religion, so his people would be
converted. The primary vector for spreading the new religion was through
the ruling class. Missionaries from the Church would meet with the local
ruler and attempt to win him over. Maybe money would change hands or
promises would be made for support against a rival.

It was not the only way the new religion spread, but it was essential
that the rulers be converted if the new religion was going to make it.
Read about the early days of Christianity in England and it does not
sound very Christian. Monasteries were more like frat houses and the
nunneries were their sororities. The Church looked past it because this
was what was needed to keep the ruling class on board. They needed the
rulers to impose the new faith on the people.

The most famous account we have is from the Venerable Bede, who tells us
of the first meeting between St. Augustine and King Æthelberht of Kent.
The king would not meet with him indoors, as he thought Augustine could
be a sorcerer. The king did not convert to Christianity right away, but
he did give Augustine freedom to preach and invited him to reside in
Canterbury. The king’s wife was a Frank and probably a Christian
already, so we see how women are always a potential exploit.

We seem to be experiencing something similar. Those medieval peasants
must have thought the world was going mad at times. One day some men
with weird haircuts show up and before long the lord is forcing them to
be baptized in a new religion that makes no sense to them. Today the
boss goes off to a conference and when he returns, he is babbling about
white fragility and structural racism. The whole department is then
marched off to be trained in how to hate their ancestors.

Of course, we do not have to go back to the sixth century for examples.
It must have felt similar to the peasants of Russia when beady-eyed
urbanites with foreign surnames arrived from the city saying that the
landlord is dead, and they are now part of a Bolshevik Soviet. The whole
language of life was changed in just one generation, which is what we
are experiencing today. Our ancestors would be baffled by things like
“systemic racism” and pronoun declarations.

The thing is, Christianity stuck around for a long time for two main
reasons. One is it adapted to the people and culture. From the start,
English Christianity was different from Frankish Christianity. Second,
there was an inherent logic to Christianity that made it suitable as an
organizing ethos for a people. If you followed the rules, you were just
as likely to make it to heaven as everyone else who followed the rules.
In other words, there was a limiting principle to keep fanaticism on a
tight leash.

The new religion, like various forms of Marxism, is riddled with
internal contradictions that inhibit social cohesion. It needs conflict
or as the Marxists call it, perpetual revolution, in order to justify
itself. Christianity was the lifelong search for God, while these
secular faiths are the endless search for the Devil. Of course, these
secular religions have no limiting principle. Every believer is in a
race to see who can be the most fanatical in their devotion to the one
true faith.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
