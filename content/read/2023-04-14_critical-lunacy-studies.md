When I was on the RamZPaul Show, he asked about something and we ended
up talking about the lunacy of the age. If you take a step back, it is
as if the people in charge are putting on a show. It is supposed to be
ridiculous. They are killing time with this stuff to entertain each
other. We just happen to be seeing it, but the whole point of it is to
keep the Cloud People entertained.

Therefore, the best response from normal people is to laugh at it, maybe
just shrug and ignore it if possible. Back when I was just starting out,
this was what a few managers decided to do when we were sent off to
sensitivity training. This is what they called diversity training back
in the before times. They decided to do the absolute minimum in the
training class and show it no respect.

One of them brought a newspaper and another one had a paperback. They
sat in the back and read while the African guy did his thing at the
front. Having a fresh off the boat African do the training was a bad
choice, as he struggled to read his lines. He kept looking to the back
of the room where the rebels were ignoring him. He never said anything
to them, and the class ended without incident.

Of course, it is hard to ignore what is going on, but that does not mean
we have to treat it with respect or pretend it is serious. A pervert in
your kid’s school is serious, but his make-believe nonsense about gender
is not serious. Anyone playing along with it deserves to be mocked and
ridiculed. Laughing in the face of someone announcing their pronouns is
the revolutionary act of this age.

People on our side get vexed with Tucker for not going hard, but his
best weapon is the Tucker face he uses when mocking these people. The
same is true of Elon Musk, who shows signs of sanity, but never looks
too long in our direction. Him being a billionaire shit-poaster is the
best he can do, and he does real damage to the people demanding the
dissidents get censured by big tech.

In other words, they are the best they can do. In an age when things
will have to get much worse before there is an opportunity to change
things, the best you can do is immiserate the people in charge. When
their best weapon is menticide, your best weapon is a healthy attitude
and indifference to their tricks. Lunatics hate being mocked as much as
they hate being ignored.
