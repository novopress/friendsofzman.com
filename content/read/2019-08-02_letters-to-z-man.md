Since this week is a show about answering questions, here are a few
items I did not have time to address in the show. A few people have
asked about Ann Coulter linking to a post the other day. They wanted to
know how much traffic it generated. The answer is not very much. Twitter
is not much a traffic generator, even with big accounts like Coulter, as
people on that platform don’t follow links. It’s why I have not bothered
to get back on the platform. It’s just another silo on the internet.

The number one source of traffic here is the search engine. I can see
the URL that brings people to me and it is either a topic I cover or
something with the phrase “Z Blog” in it. That I take to be word of
mouth. Someone mentions to a friend that they read the site and that
friend then googles the term. After that, it is sites like
<a href="http://maggiesfarm.anotherdotcom.com/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maggie’s Farm</a>,
<a href="https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WRSA</a> and the
<a href="http://www.woodpilereport.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Woodpile</a>.
<a href="http://theferalirishman.blogspot.com/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Feral Irishman</a> is
another example of the type of site that moves a lot of people along to
other sites.

A few people have asked about why their comments end up in moderation.
This is something I’ve been meaning to explain for a while. The spam
filter does a great job of blocking the obvious stuff. Questionable
items end up in moderation. What makes a comment questionable? Epithets,
vulgar language and too many links. If you avoid using crude language
and don’t load up the comment with a million links, then it goes right
through, so avoid bad language.

I’ve gotten a few queries about the readability of the site on mobile
devices. I just added a mobile option to the site, so let me know how it
looks. The text should be heavier and slightly larger. I can also
increase the mobile font size, but you can also zoom on your mobile to
do the same thing. The thing with mobile devices is they are all
different and there is no magic way to make the site just right for all
of them. Well, there may be a way, but I’m not investing the time to do
it.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.

fields of dissident media are motivated by a sense of duty, having a
place to sleep and food on the table still requires money.
