------------------------------------------------------------------------

All wars have their unique character, but the war in the Ukraine is
probably one of the strangest in the history of the West. Its
strangeness is due to the two sides operating from a different set of
facts and a different framework for those facts. It is as if the two
sides are fighting entirely different wars. In point of fact, the two
sides are fighting different wars, despite doing so on a common
battlefield. That reality is about to become clearer as the war moves
into winter.

The first main difference in the war is that the Russians are fighting
it from a highly legalistic and bureaucratic perspective. The West does
not seem to grasp this and keeps treating it like a cartoonish war of
conquest. They frame Putin as a version of Hitler, who is now a cartoon
villain in the Western imagination. Putin is attacking Ukraine for no
reason at all and has no real plan other than war. It is just some
irrational land grab, like when Hitler conquered Poland¹.

In reality the Russians have conducted this war like a group of lawyers
engaged in complex civil litigation. They spend a lot of time on
legalistic points like the official legal status of the disputed
territory. Before the start of the war, the Russians put a lot of time
into legally recognizing Luhansk and Donetsk as independent territories.
The ongoing attacks on these areas by Ukraine was the legal pretext for
the Special Military Operation that started eight months ago.

This legalistic mindset is turning up in the response to the terrorist
attack on the Kerch bridge in the Crimea. The facts were quickly
established. Ukraine took credit for the attack and promised more. Once
the Russian investigators confirmed the essentials of the attack, that
it was terrorism and sponsored by Ukraine, the Russians could then
conduct anti-terrorism activity. Again, this an important legal
distinction for the Russians, as it permits specific activities.

Russia launched one hundred missiles at key Ukrainian facilities
overnight as a response to the attack and as a warning. Much of the
internet is down in Ukraine and parts of various cities are without
power and water. You see, Russia can legally attack civilian
infrastructure in response to terror attacks. The warning here is that
if the terrorism continues, the Russians have the legal right to take
out all of Ukraine’s power, water and communications systems.

Contrast this with how the West is fighting the war. At the start,
Western governments seized the property of Russian companies and
individuals. There was no court case or legal arguments about it. They
just did it. They filled Western media with gleeful stories about
stealing the yachts of Russian oligarchs. The owner of the Chelsea
football club was forced to sell the team. Germany seized the assets of
Gazprom, the Russian energy firm that supplies its natural gas.

Then you have the sanctions war. Much of what has been imposed on Russia
has been done outside the normal channels. The whole point of the New
World Order is that it is a rules based world and those rules are
administered though global entities like the World Bank and the World
Trade Organization. The point of these groups is to hash out difference
between countries. All of those were bypassed. Even the legislatures of
the respective countries were bypassed.

When you put the two ways of waging the war side-by-side, you get a
picture that is the opposite of what is presented. The one side is
bogging itself down in paperwork and legalism while the other side is
cutting through the red tape and the rule of law to implement the latest
polices. In a way, it is like this war is being waged between the
bureaucracy of the post office and the leadership of the Mafia. It is a
war between two entirely alien ways of viewing the world.

Another place you see the contrast is in public relations. The Russians
have abandoned the field when it comes to the meme war. They have
invested no effort in winning the daily news cycle or spinning events
into clever narratives. Instead, they provide daily updates on the
granular details of the war. If you care about how many flat tires were
fixed by Russian forces every day, the Ministry of Defense is your
source. Their reports are a dry accounting of the basic facts.

On the other hand, the Western side of the war is a carnival of creative
stories that are splashed across Western media. The occupation of
abandoned territory in the north was treated like the Battle of the
Bulge. The terror attack on the Kerch bridge was a great blow to the
Russian army. Once it was clear the bridge was not destroyed and was
back in service, it was off to the next narrative. The West has been
waging this war on the internet as if it is actually taking place there.

Probably the biggest difference between the two sides is how they
explain their respective involvement in the war. The Russians see it as
a defense of the Russian people and the Russian homeland. The people in
the Donbas are Russians and therefore must be defended by Russia.
Further, Western activity in Ukraine is portrayed as part of a larger
American effort to destroy Russia. The Russian people are once again
being called upon to defend the motherland.

In the West, the war is an abstract thing. It is a defense of democracy,
which is a thing no one bothers to explain. In fact, if you ask what it
means you get shouted down as a threat to our democracy. Like so much of
what has happened in the West over the last three decades, this war is a
moral signifier. If you support it, you are a good person, but if you
have doubts, it means you are a bad person. Even thinking about why this
is true is a sign you may be a bad person.

All wars have consequences but it is never easy to see what they are
until they finally arrive, usually long after the fighting has ended. No
one at the end of the Great War imagined the events of the 1930’s. In
this case, the West is sure that what lies ahead is their New World
Order. The Russians think what lies ahead is a multipolar world of which
they are an important part. Two powers, fighting two wars with two
visions of what comes next and both cannot be right.
