With so much news coming from Europe this week, I thought a show about
European politics would be a good way to kick off the summer. Once a
quarter I do a show about international topics. These are some of the
more popular podcasts, as I get a lot of traffic from Europe, relative
to normal. Our friends over the sea pay a lot of attention to us, but
they also want to know what we are thinking about them. Even though our
understanding of the world is not always the best, it matter the most.

I’ve made this point before, but I think we can learn a lot about the
politics of this thing by watching how the European dissidents go about
their efforts. They have different political systems and some advantages
we lack, but they are a bit more advanced when it comes to organizing
and advertising themselves. They have done a better job handling the
“freaks and weirdos” problem, for example. It makes sense for our side
to keep an eye on Europe and steal the good ideas that can work in
America.

The main thing the Euros have going for them is they have natural
identities. They know what it means to be French or Finnish. The usual
suspects are trying to play the same game there as they do hear,
muddying the waters by claiming random Africans are English, but it’s
not fooling many people. Europe has been identitarian since the first
humans encountered Neanderthals. The only people willing to accept the
fluid definition of ethnicity are crazy people and foreigners looking to
game the system.

For the show this week, I’m mostly sticking to the election related
stuff. The EU parliament elections are mostly a show, as the EU
parliament is useless, but it does provide an insight into what people
are thinking. It is meaninglessness allows people to vote their current
sentiment, so it is like a massive opinion poll. With nothing on the
line and no traditional loyalties to consider, people can be more
honest. It’s not a perfect survey of opinion, but it does provide some
useful insights about attitudes.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
