rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> is yet another
example of why atheists are terrible people. If Christianity folded up
shop tomorrow, they would re-invent it, just so they could cause
problems for the Christians.

*A humanist advocacy group has filed a federal lawsuit to remove a
cross-shaped World War I memorial in Prince George’s County, alleging
the display violates the First Amendment.*

*The American Humanist Association says it does not object to the fact
that the Bladensburg Cross memorializes soldiers, but rather the
placement of the Christian symbol on property owned by a government
agency, The Daily Record reported.*

*“We are certainly recommending coming up with a monument inclusive of
all religious groups,” said Monica Miller, a lawyer with the
association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center.*

*In 2012, the group sent a letter to the Maryland-National Capital Park
and Planning Commission demanding that the cross be removed from the war
memorial. The group said it would have no objection if the cross was on
private land, MyFoxDC.com reported.*

*John Moss, the town’s administrator, said the Bladensburg Cross is not
endorsing any faith.*

*“The cross memorializes our veterans,” he told The Daily Record. “It
was never meant to be a religious icon.”*

*The 40-foot-tall concrete memorial was erected in 1925 by the American
Legion to commemorate the 49 men of Prince George’s County who died
during World War I.*

Look, I’m not a religious guy. The last time I was in church was a
couple of years ago for a friend’s ordination. Before that was probably
Christmas mass at the insistence of friends, but when that was I don’t
recall. Left to my own, I’m not going to church or thinking much about
the existence of God. I’m an empirically minded guy which means I don’t
dwell on what I can never possibly know. I’m not much of a joiner either
so church is not offering much to a guy like me.

Religion does, however, bring joy and happiness to tens of millions of
my fellow citizens, so if they want to put up crosses all over the
country, good for them. Their expression of their faith is not harming
anyone. In fact, I think America was probably better run when most
people attended services. It kept the cultural rot at bay and it kept
the lunatics under control. An aggressively Christian population would
probably be a good antidote to Progressivism, as long as the women are
not permitted to vote.

This monument has been up since 1925. No one complained since 1925. Then
this collection of dick heads comes along and forces the public to spend
tax money to defend normalcy. Here’s the
<a href="http://americanhumanist.org/AHA/Contact"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staff list</a> of the
Anti-Humanist Society. If you have a chance to make their life a living
hell in some way, please take it. With any luck, all of them will come
down with an excruciating disease.

Anyway, you’ll notice they steer clear of Jews and Muslims. The former
runs the country and has plenty of resources to crush these people. The
latter has no qualms about killing for the faith. You can be sure the
“humanists” will not be posting Mohamed cartoons on their web page.
Christians have foolishly forgotten their roots and let themselves get
pushed around by these people. My advice to Christianity is get back to
your roots. Kill a few humanists the old fashioned way and the rest will
run for cover.
