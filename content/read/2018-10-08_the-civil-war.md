The paleocons recognized in the 1980’s, that the conservatism of Bill
Buckley was doomed to fail, because it started from the premise that the
current political arrangements were legitimate. Since the left had
defined those arrangements, it meant the right was going to become
corrupted by its willingness to operate within the progressives rules.
For example, if you agree that segregation is evil, there are only a
narrow set of policy positions you can support with regards to race.

That is, of course, exactly what happened. Instead of being a moral
philosophy that stood in opposition to Progressivism, it became a foil.
Conservatives were the controlled opposition, who gave legitimacy to
left-wing ideas by opposing them and then ultimately embracing them. If
you embrace the premise, you inevitably embrace the ends. The debate is
about the middle part. It is why conservatives have spent decades trying
to accomplish the goals of the Left, without embracing the means of the
Left.

During the Cold War, the debate between the left and right was mostly
about economics and foreign policy. As much as the conservatives tried
to paint the left as a bunch of Bolsheviks, the right never seriously
challenged the left on socialist policies like public pensions,
socialized medicine, and anti-poverty programs. Similarly, the approach
to the Soviets was a debate about how to best manage it. The exception
was Reagan’s talk of roll back, but that was mostly rhetoric.

That is something to keep in mind with the battle over what will come to
oppose the latest iteration of progressivism. The Ben Shapiro types who
are endlessly punching right by demanding America be defined as an idea,
rather than a place and people, are embracing the main argument of the
left. They have different notions of what those ideas mean and how they
should be implemented, but Shapiro agrees with the left that America is
just a set of ideas, not a place and people.

This new right must end the same way as Buckley conservatism ended. That
is, as an amen chorus for the progressive state. If you agree that the
new definition of a nation is post-national, as in not being defined by
borders, language, and people, then the debate is what defines the new
state. If you further agree that the new state is defined by ideas and a
set of values, then the only thing left is to figure out who defines
those ideas and how will they be enforced.

This notion of the state as a post-national, post-Christian theocracy is
not without real consequences. It may seem ridiculous, but when the
people in charge believe in something, no matter how absurd, the people
pay the price. You see that in the Kavanaugh fight. Big shot
intellectuals are starting to notice what people on this side of the
great divide have been saying for years. If society is defined by “who
we are” then someone who dissents [must be excluded from that
society](https://www.weeklystandard.com/christopher-caldwell/kavanaughs-opening-statement-is-the-defining-speech-of-our-time),
by force, if necessary.

At the founding, opponents of the new Constitution argued that the new
political model would inevitably result in the supremacy of the court.
Anti-federalists argued<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> that the
Supreme Court would become a source of massive abuse. Beyond the power
of the executive, the court would eventually come to dominate the
</span>legislative<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> branch. This is
exactly where we find ourselves today, where both sides of the
ruling </span>elite<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> view the court as
the only source of legitimate
moral </span>authority<span style="line-height: 1.625;">.</span>

That’s why the Kavanaugh fight was so vicious. Progressives fear the
court could define “who we are” in such a way that excludes them. It’s
also why guys like Ben Shapiro are not just wrong, but dangerously
wrong. By going along with the general premise of a country being just a
set of values, he is committing suicide on your behalf. He has a place
to go if things don’t work out here. If the definition of “who we are”
turns out to not include you, where are you going to go?

That’s why this new notion of the state can only end in horror. Since
the Greeks, political philosophy has assumed that a society is a group
of related people, with a shared history and shared space. The debate
was over how best to organize society, to match the temperament and
character of the people. This new model allows no room for debate and no
tolerance of dissent. Like every totalitarian ideology, it has to end in
a bloodbath to define “who we are.”
