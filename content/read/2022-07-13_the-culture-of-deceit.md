A recent Gallup <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey</a> reports that confidence in
institutions has fallen to an all time low among Americans. The only
institutions trusted by a majority of people are small business, the
military and the police. The last two are dropping quickly, which makes
sense given the behavior of these institutions. A military full of drag
queens and a police force siding with barbarians does not inspire
confidence. Faith in small business simply reflects the fact that people
continue to trust good people.

The normal reaction from the usual suspects is to blame their favorite
bogeymen for the collapse in social trust. They will not use the term
“social trust” as that risks entering a forbidden zone, but that is the
topic. Trust in institutions is a proxy for social trust, how much
people trust the people they do not know in their community. A big
driver of the collapse in social trust is a generation of open borders.
When your neighborhood is full of strange aliens, it is hard to trust
anything or anyone.

As is often the case, the flood of aliens into your neighborhood is a
symptom of a much bigger problem that lies at the heart of it. The
people in charge simply cannot stop lying, which reflects on the
institutions they control. The obvious example is the news media, which
is approaching single digits in the Gallup poll. The fact that anyone
trusts the media is an argument against universal suffrage. Many people,
at least ten percent based on the survey, are too stupid to vote.

Putting that aside, the media has become a torrent of lies. Since the
very beginning, the media has been partisan. In colonial times,
newspapers were known to be advocates for one faction or another. This
is what you should get in a society with a free press, free speech and a
culture of debate. The partisans in the media make their case for their
cause, often cherry picking the facts that work best for them. This is
no different from what happens in a courtroom or a business meeting.

That is a vastly different thing than what we see today. Only a complete
idiot trusts anything he reads or hears in the media. The starting
assumption is not only that the facts are wrong, but the people behind
them know they are wrong. It is not partisan zeal or human error, but a
deliberate effort to deceive. The people endlessly going on about
disinformation are the primary source of disinformation. They either
promote the lies of government or they create their own lies.

This <a href="https://archive.ph/nOy5p" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> about the war in the New York Times is a good
example. Some version of this story has been floating around since the
start of the war. It was cooked up by the usual suspects who have been
championing war with Russia. The central claim is they have inside
access to Putin’s inner circle is obviously false. His one source is not
an independent Russian analysist, but a paid anti-Russian activist. The
source makes this clear in his own
<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/kamil-galeev"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">bio</a>.

The author of the New York Times piece is a notorious liar who runs <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/world/europe/russia-sweden-disinformation.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">interference</a> for the neocon cult.
Despite being a proven liar, he maintains a spot at the main news site
in the empire. Certainly, his bosses know he is an activist and a liar.
They keep him on because he tells the lies they like to promote. The
point is, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we
know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying. No
wonder trust has dropped to zero.

The media is an easy example. They are simply mockingbirds mimicking the
sounds from the institutions they allegedly cover. Notice trust in
medicine has dropped over the last year, which should surprise no one.
They willingly went along with the Covid farce and the vaccine mandates.
When people raised reasonable questions about the side effects of the
vaccine, Big Medicine was right there to tell the media that those
doubters were hooligans and troublemakers.

The fact that those concerns were legitimate and proven
[correct](https://www.wmbriggs.com/post/40684/) is a big reason people
are now more skeptical of medicine. More important, telling the truth
would have served the interest of medicine. Medicine is nothing but
trade-offs between the risk of disease and the risks that come with the
cure. Chemotherapy is terrible, but it is better than dying from cancer.
Instead of being honest about this, they chose to lie which suggests
these are people who simply enjoy lying.

No one expects the institutions to be honest all the time. Men are not
angels and as long as the institutions are controlled by men, they will
have all of the vices that are part of the human condition. What is new
in this age is the culture of lying that has taken hold of the
managerial class. They seem to take pleasure in lying to the general
public, as if it is a status marker. If you cook up some outlandish
whopper you get points in the social credit system of the ruling class.

In this regard, it makes sense why they selected Biden for president. In
addition to his stupidity, Biden is a notorious liar. A big part of his
affable simpleton routine while in the senate was his penchant for
telling outlandish whoppers. Of course, he was always the hero of his
tall tales. He is a man who has done nothing useful so he made up for it
with glorious tales about himself. In a system increasing defined by a
culture of deceit, it makes sense to have a notorious liar as the
figurehead.

There is a cost to lying. The drop in trust is one consequence. The main
cost is that a society low in social trust is harder to maintain than
one with high trust. The cost of keeping America together is reaching a
tipping point. Then there is the transaction cost of everyday life. In a
world where no one trusts anyone, the cost of doing even simple things
goes up. A big part of the drop in the standard of living is due to the
collapse in social trust due to the constant lying.
