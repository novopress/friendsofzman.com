**Note:** If you are a law student or know a law student, there is a
competition around the legal difficulties of the J6 victims. It is an
essay contest. If you are interested, here is their

A week ago, Elon Musk tweeted out an offer to buy Twitter and my initial
reaction was that it was a publicity stunt. I chastised a few people on
Gab for thinking that this offer by Musk was serious. I was wrong. A few
days later the formal filing was made public and it was clear he was
making a bid for the company. This week he filed the paperwork
indicating he has secured the capital to make good on the offer.

Now, why was I wrong? One reason is I have a bias against rich people so
I naturally think the worst of them. I have often used Musk as an
example of what is wrong with state capitalism. Most of his business is
dependent on favors from the political class or direct subsidies from
government. His electric car business would have died long ago without
massive subsidies from government.

Another reason I got this Musk business wrong is I violated an important
rule of navigation in the modern age. I formed a hot take. The first
batch of news and commentary is always wrong, so the hot take based on
that stuff is almost always going to be wrong in important ways. The
right answer with regards to Musk’s initial tweets about buying Twitter
was to wait and see.

This was not the only bit of wrongness on my mind this week. The debate
about Ukraine is a good example of getting things wrong. Certain groups
of people who are dissident adjacent staked out a bad position on
Ukraine. They will have to climb back off that limb at some point and
hope everyone forgets about it. This happens a lot on this side of the
great divide for some reason.

That is the show this week. How to avoid these errors. We are all
floating in a sea of electronic media, so it is easy to be manipulated
by that media. It is also easy to react the wrong way to the barrage of
information. Central to being a dissident is standing outside the
barrage of lies and live in the truth. Therefore, avoiding error by
de-conditioning our minds is a primary project of dissident politics.
