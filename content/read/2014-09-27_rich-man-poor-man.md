The Bush years, I suspect, will be studied by historians for a long
time. It’s not that Bush was all that interesting. It’s that he and his
band of neoconservative fanatics sent so many people into a permanent
state of insanity. Most of the old paleos went nuts over the war
mongering. Many eventually embraced the weird anti-Israel paranoia that
used to be the private domain of the Lyndon <span class="st">LaRouche
</span>followers. That’s not to say Israel is not trouble, it’s just
that they are not the only trouble.

The Left, of course, was taken over by the crazies. The end of the Cold
War probably was the main cause, but Bush hatred was one cause. Maybe
Bush hatred was just a symptom of the craziness. it really does not
matter. What the Bush years revealed is the ruling class has gone crazy.
One side wants to make war on the world and the other side wants to make
war on us. Lots of people have gone crazy trying to understand what in
the world is happening to these people.

There were minor figures who also went bonkers.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Dreher"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rod Dreher</a> was a
conventional Catholic conservative in the Sam Francis vein. Then he
started getting squirrelly, writing about “crunchy-cons” and then he
wandered off to find himself. His work today has all the hallmarks of a
man who was defined by his faith and then lost his faith. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">There’s a maudlin obsession
with suffering</a>. The source story is <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The bullshit meter
is at eleven on this one. A little google work and I see <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it is a hoax</a>.

The fact is we have four types of poor people in America. The first and
most common is the dependency class. These are the folks you never see.
They live in the bad areas or what you assume to be bad areas. In the
ghetto, the women get on the dole and the men sell drugs, get high and
get in trouble. There are some of the other type of ghetto dweller. This
is the working poor. These people have jobs and try to live decent
lives.

Then you have the temporary poor. These are young people starting out
and divorced mothers trying to bounce back. The former often made some
poor early choices and are struggling to recover. They do and it builds
character. The latter are women who end up divorced with kids and living
in an apartment. Again, it is temporary. Eventually their salary rises
and the kids move on or they find a new man. The thing with this group
is they just don’t have money. That’s different than poverty, which has
a behavior component. Give these people more money and they put it away
for a rainy day.

The final category of poor people are the imaginary ones. These are the
poor the SWPL-types like Rod Dreher read about or see on TV. The
imaginary poor are designed to elicit feelings of pity followed by an
urge to “get involved.” The tale offered up by Linda Tirado, for
example. hits all the current fads in SWPL-ville. She smokes and eats
junk food. SWPL’s are big into self-denial. She prefers abortion to
motherhood, but the closest abortion mill is too far away so she has
kids she does not want.

This weird form of Mercerism would be harmless if not for the fact
public policy is all geared toward helping the imaginary and temporary
poor. Rod Dreher spends hours coming up with ideas to do something about
the imaginary poor. Democrats in Washington are always championing
polices to help the temporary poor, but end up writing laws for the
imaginary poor, cause that’s where the emotion lies. It is why Mao
packed off the intellectuals for the rice paddy.
