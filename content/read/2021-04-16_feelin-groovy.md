Maybe it is the rush of spring, but this felt like a good week. Here in
Lagos, the trees are starting to bloom and the weather is just about
perfect. For me, anything above 75 is uncomfortable, so temps in the
mid-60’s are pretty nice. There is also the fact that the day job has
been hassle free lately. Since the onset of the plague, my schedule has
been packed with people demanding my immediate attention. The last few
weeks it has settled into something of a comfortable pattern for a
change.

In the political realm, the absurdity of it all is too much to ignore. I
was talking with a friend who was never fond of Trump. He voted for him,
at least that is what he said, but he thought Trump was a clown. He said
to me, “You’re my age. Did you ever think Joe Biden would be President?”
It was one of those moments when the ridiculousness of the age jumps out
at you. Normal white people are walking around with the same thought in
their head. We live in clown world.

At lunch the other day, the economy was the topic. One person would
mention the bad news, like the rising cost of most things. Someone would
counter with the stock market or the supposed hiring spike. This went
back and forth until someone finally said, “You know, none of this could
be true at all. No one knows what’s going on because we can’t trust
anything we’re being told.” Again, I detected that detached bemusement
that comes when you stop pretending it matters.

I think the thing that did it for me was when I checked out some clips
from the Chauvin trial the other day. The state had called a doctor who
was supposed to be an expert on cardiovascular issues. The guy was such
a ridiculous ham, that it felt like satire. He clearly went to the
William Shatner School of Acting. He did a dramatic performance of
lifesaving doctor for the jury, but then the defense lawyer asked, “So
what you are saying is George Floyd would be alive if just got in the
police car?”

I think if I were on that jury, I would have bust out laughing.
Everything about that trial feels like a joke on us by the people
running this simulation. In fact, that is true about most everything
these days. Joe Biden as President would have been a punch line to a
joke not so long ago. Men in dresses playing girls’ sports? You just
have to step back and admire the absurdity of it all. We cannot know
what African scholars will call this time, but it will most likely focus
on the silliness of the age.

Reality does not like to be mocked, so you can be sure a corrective, and
a very large one, is lying out there in the distance. Maybe the fantasy
economy will suddenly slam into mathematical realty. Maybe Russia and
China will figure out that our military is a wreck and the leadership is
a joke. Maybe Mother Nature decides to send a real plague to teach those
mask wearing idiots a lesson. Who knows? For now though, it is spring,
the flowers are blooming and clown world is in peak form.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

**Promotions:** The good folks at

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
