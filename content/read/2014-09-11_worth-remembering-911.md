This day has become an unofficial holiday for Red Team. Members of
Conservative Inc get to go on TV and act solemn and serious, maybe even
say a bad word about Islam. The Forever War crowd gets to compare some
batch of Muslim fanatics to Hitler, demanding we blow them up before,
wait for it, we have another 9/11. The only good thing is Lefty stays
home and hides under his bed. Otherwise, Derbyshire is right on this
one. You don’t celebrate great failures or humiliations.

his blog.

*We remember how the 9/11 era began today, and the emotions are still
fresh and strong, 13 years later.*

*But that was only one part of the story.*

*Take a good look, ISIS. [You never know when the U.S. Navy SEALs are at
your
door](http://abcnews.go.com/International/photos/photos-inside-osama-bin-laden-kill-zone-13508190/image-13508205).*

My response:

*Not really. It was a stunning failure by our rulers, for sure, but not
one worth remembering. If our rulers had learned from their blunders
leading up to 9/11, then sure. But, they learned nothing. They continue
to troll Muslim countries for immigrants. Inviting people who want you
dead to settle in your lands is madness, but here we are anyway.*

*If anything, our rulers drew all the wrong lessons. They reasoned that
the Muslims attacked America because it was full of Americans. If they
could just replace all the Americans with foreign imports, problem
solved! Since 9/11 Muslim immigration has gone up with over one million
of them coming here from places like Yemen, Syria and Iraq.*

*I guess if you want to get weepy on 9/11, the thought that our rulers
are not the only people who want us dead is a good reason.*

The lesson of 9/11 is big bureaucracies are not good at this stuff.
That’s not what they are built for, which is why they fail at small,
complex tasks. Government is a sledgehammer, not a scalpel. In order to
prevent another 9/11, we should have immediately ended all immigration
from Muslim countries. Visas for visiting should have been limited to
diplomatic and high level trade. If an oil sheik needs to come here to
do a deal with Exxon, fine.

Further, Muslims here should have been deported if they were not
citizens. The foreign funding for mosques should have been confiscated.
We can’t ban the religion, although I would be in favor of it, but we
can encourage our citizens to put out the unwelcome mat to Muslims.
Islam is a fine religion that brings its adherent happiness. It is
incompatible western democracy. It is hostile to western culture. We
should have learned that 13 years ago. Our rulers learned the opposite.

Happy 9/11
