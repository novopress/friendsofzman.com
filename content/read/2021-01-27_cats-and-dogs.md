Anyone who has had a cat knows that the cat takes a certain pleasure in
the acquisition of its food. Put food down for the dog and the dog eats
the food. Put food down for the cat and it will saunter up to the dish
and maybe sample a little, then take a break to watch the dish for a
while, before returning for some more food. A bug gets loose in the
house and the dog will just eat it, but the cat will torment the thing
to death. One animal is all about the process, while the other is about
the result.

This difference is something to keep in mind as America descends into
the woke totalitarianism of our diversity loving masters. It is assumed
that totalitarianism leads to labor camps and people disappearing in the
night. Those are the examples we have from our history. The communists
liked sending the uncooperative to work camps, while the fascist like
shooting the inconvenient. In both cases, the point was to remove the
problem and discourage others from being a problem.

Those old school totalitarians were dog people. Just as the dog is happy
to eat when hungry, without thinking much about how the food was made
available to him, the old totalitarians took an end justifies the means
approach to exercising power. Problem people were like any other sort of
problem. The point was to solve the problem, which in the case of people
meant making them go away. No man, no problem. How the problem felt
about what was happening was of no consideration.

Our new totalitarians turn all of this on its head. Like the cat and his
food, or his prey in the case of an unfortunate insect, the end is not
really the point. It is not about removing the obstacles to their
project, in order to achieve some end. The dealing with the problem is
the end. In the case of the poor unfortunate who has run afoul of the
rulers, the point of the process is submitting the troublemaker to
endless torment that has no purpose beyond the pleasure of the
tormentor.

Take the doxing business as an example. The people who do this are not
trying to make the victim go away, any more than the cat wants the
wayward cricket to go away. To the contrary, they hope the victim will
cry out in agony and make his misery into a long-drawn-out public
performance. They revel in seeing the victim moan about how his PayPal
was deleted or how he lost his job. For the army of the woke, the
suffering of the victim and the fame for inflicting that suffering is
what matters.

When the victim simply kills off his internet character, the doxers have
a problem as they do not have that living trophy to show off on-line.
They are forced to go onto their social media platforms and imagine how
the victim is suffering. We are not far away from a time when Twitter or
Facebook start creating scapegoat accounts for the anointed to attack as
a part of their rituals.  Instead of relying on a real person to be the
victim, they will conjure a fake one that plays the victim properly.

Of course, in every totalitarian society, the people eventually figure
out the rules in order to avoid the boot. That was the point of the old
totalitarian model. In the new totalitarian model, the rules will
constantly change so it is nearly impossible to avoid the wrath of the
official tormentors. After all, like the cat tormenting its prey, the
new totalitarians care only for the process. Like an engine needs fuel,
the new totalitarians need a constant supply of victims to torment.

An excellent example of this is the Covid madness. When it all started,
the point was to slow the spread so the hospitals would not be too
crowded. We had two weeks to flatten the curve, but after two weeks the
rules changed. The rules keep changing as the rulers find new ways to
torment us, causing people to go into the streets to protest the new
torments, to the delight of the tormentors. Covid has revealed that the
new totalitarians are little more than sadists.

What this means, of course, is that there will be not settling into a
set of fixed rules as happened in communist societies. We do not know if
this would have happened in certain fascist societies, but the
experience of Franco’s Spain, Salazar’s Portugal and Pinochet’s Chile
suggest the fascists would have settled into a conservative system of
fixed rules. The new system, in contrast, will be perpetually disrupting
this tendency in order to perpetuate the necessary disorderliness.

The question is whether any society can go on very long when the rules
are constantly changing in order to give the Torquemada’s more victims.
A bedrock requirement for any society is a set of rules to govern
conduct. In order to have an organization of humans greater than the
Dunbar number means having a code and a way to enforce that code in
order to make the code a habit of mind. This is what we think of when we
think of culture. The rules we live by because we just do.

We are already seeing problems with the Covid madness. The ever-changing
rules are making life impossible for small business. In some areas,
whole swaths of the economy have collapsed. Of course, the religious
aspects to compliance are pitting people against one another. The new
totalitarians are creating a Hobbesian world where it is a war of all
against all, not for limited resources, but due to the deliberate
cacophony of every changing rules that have no logic.

The good news, if there is any, is that totalitarianism has diminishing
returns, as the cost of maintaining it eventually dwarfs the benefits.
Initially it seems to work pretty well, but over time the costs become
unsustainable. This new totalitarianism is especially front loaded,
almost accelerationist. It is destroying every reason for people to
remain loyal to the system. Instead of carrying on for several
generations, the new totalitarianism will be lucky to make it past this
decade.
