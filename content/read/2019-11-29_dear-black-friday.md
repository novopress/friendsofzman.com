One of the little known truths about dissident politics is in order to
get paid for a holiday, you have to work the day before and the day
after. That sounds pretty rough, but you do get paid time and a half if
the the holiday has the word “black” in it. That means a Black Friday
edition of the Power Hour. The hardest working man in dissident show biz
is not going to miss an opportunity to remind everyone of that fact.

This time of year is actually the slowest time of the year for site
traffic. I think it holds for listening, but the metrics I have are not
very reliable. The Spreaker numbers are not very accurate and the other
platforms don’t have any measures. My guess though is the podcast
audience shrinks along with the site traffic. People into this stuff
have jobs and this is a busy time for the employed. Lots to do before
take time off.

Given that this is the time of the year when American give thanks and
think about their good fortune, a letters episode seems appropriate. I’m
also now fully caught up on all correspondence for the first time in a
long time. I have a few items left over, but those are outside the
normal mailbag. Otherwise, the inbox is clean, the nail bag is empty and
the secret e-mail account is also clean. For that I am thankful.

After the last one of these, someone asked how I pick the questions to
use. The simple answer is I use those that I think are interesting.
Questions about myself or about general politics are not all that
interesting to people. Questions about subjects I don’t cover in the
blog are much more interesting to me, so I assume they will be
interesting to the audience. I could be wrong, but that’s the method to
the madness.

Since I know everyone will be out donating their savings to globohomo
today, you can now do so to the sound of my voice. I will not be
partaking in Black Friday. Here in Lagos, every day is black Friday. I
will be working around the house on some chores I have been saving for
the long weekend. Arbeit macht frei. I’m also working on the book this
weekend, trying to get that project off the ground finally.

I’m also now on something called
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, which I am told is more popular than
Spotify, which banned me last year. I looked up the respective audiences
and Deezer does appear to have a bigger audience, even though I’ve never
heard of it. My guess is it caters to a European audience, but I’m just
going off the fact that it is based in Europe and run by Europeans.
Regardless, it is another option for you.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one

support!
