Whenever I do a show on the new religion, I am struck by the stupidity
of the claims made by these people, but also the radicalism of it. The
people pushing this stuff are not just attacking the Western idea of
individual rights. They are attacking the notion that you are an
individual with some control over your life. Essential to the social
justice cause is the assertion that you are a product of social forces.

Because your protestations against the various social pogroms that come
out of the new religion are the result of your conditioning, the social
justice warrior sees your resistance as proof of her claims. The more
you try to explain why you do not want to submit to the new rules, the
more certain she is that she is right. It is why these people are always
on the attack. They need the feedback.

Ideologies, like religions, usually fall into two main camps. One camp
is world-affirming and one is world-denying. The former accepts the
reality of the human condition, while the latter assumes the human
condition can be transcended. Folk religions seek help from the gods for
practical things like a good harvest. Universal religions promise relief
from suffering in the next life.

The new religion is a strange combination of these two main ideas. It
starts with the unfairness and inequity of this world. The fight for
social justice does not expressly promise salvation or relief from
suffering, but the implication is that at some point in the future we
attain social justice. On the other hand, it also seems to expect
tangible benefits in the present if certain rituals are followed.

In practice the new religion promises the believers liberations from
whatever it is they think is oppressing them. The blacks will be free of
whiteness. The xirls will be free of the pale penis people. The fat will
be liberated from gravity. This desire for liberation from some aspect
of the present reality lacks specificity, which suggests it is a
destination that lies outside the realm of material existence.

Integral to these claims is the blatant cries for vengeance. The attacks
on white people, for example, are purely based in racial vengeance.
Whether it is black teens attacking white people on the streets or the
system being corrupted to exact vengeance on white people in official
settings like a courtroom, the whole purpose is to get some payback in
the here and now, not after the revolution.

Of course, much of what all of this depends upon is the mediocrity of
the people embracing the social justice religion. Modern technological
society has been difficult on the sorts of people bourgeoise society
produces in abundance, which is the credentialed mediocrity. These are
the people who think they are smart, but struggle with the complexity of
modern life.

The new religion offers them refuge. They have to learn a bunch of
esoteric insider language and concepts, which reinforces their belief in
their own intelligence, but this is not math, so the right answer is a
matter of perspective. Everyone gets their own truth and the sense they
had to possess special qualities in order to gain it. Social justice is
an ideal religion for alienated bourgeoise females.
