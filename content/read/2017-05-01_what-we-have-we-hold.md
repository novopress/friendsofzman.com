The title for this post is a quote often attributed to Leonid Brezhnev
or sometimes to Stalin, but like many pithy quotes, its origins are
unknown. It was most likely a quick shorthand for the view of the
Soviets, during the Brezhnev era, that their sacrifices in the war
entitled them to hold the satellite countries of Eastern Europe. The
rhetoric of the Soviets, particularly with regards to the third world,
could never be squared with the fact that they held a sizable chunk of
Europe captive, but they somehow found a way to justify it.

It is also a useful way of understanding the psychology of Progressive
groups. They operate a lot like car thieves in the ghetto. A guy
boosts a car and immediately buys an air freshener for it, puts some of
his clothes in the backseat and always, always litters it with some of
his mail. Anyone who has repossessed cars knows this, which is why it is
such a great line in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mxs6A1byIo"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this movie</a>. At some level,
the thief knows it is not his car, but he makes it his car in the same
way a dog marks his territory. It’s his as long as it has his stuff in
it.

That’s the mindset of the Progressive. The political ground they
acquire, no matter how they acquire it, is theirs. They own it and they
intend to keep it. It is not open for debate. It is why Obama, for
example, was fond of saying he would not “re-litigate” ObamaCare with
the Republicans. As far as he was concerned, he won that ground and he
was *entitled* to keep it. The next debate would have to be over your
stuff and how much of it he could take from you and how much you would
be allowed to hold, for now.

It is a mistake, I think, to assume it is a conscious strategy they
think about before executing. Obama was not sitting around with his
advisers coming up with a clever way to close off debate about his
health care bill. It’s a natural instinct, resulting from their
obsession with the future. Their singular obsession is what they imagine
to be the promised land that is just beyond the horizon. Any
reconsideration of the past is the same in their mind as turning away
from the future and marching backwards.

This impulse is so powerful, it has warped public debate for as long as
anyone reading this has been alive. <a

And there it is, the debate is over, as Al Gore would say. There’s no
need to rehash those old debates about feelings counting for more than
facts. To do so is to fall prey to temptation in the same way a drunkard
or drug addict falls off the wagon. No, the pure of heart and mind will
resist temptation and honor all the hard work it took to capture that
ground for the Progs. “There’s no going back to the dark ages, comrade.
What we have, we hold. Now it is time to debate how you will adjust to
this new reality.”

This rhetorical slight of hand is so natural and relentless, that it
tends to wear down all opposition. Normal people get weary of constantly
pushing back against the Progs and then “click” the ratchet snaps
forward. It’s how we went so quickly from “Hey maybe we need an
accommodation for same sex couples” to “the Founders always wanted
homosexual marriage. It is right there in the Constitution.” The Progs
lost fight after fight, but once they won one, the debate was over and
it has been over ever since.

This is a lesson and a warning for the growing revolt against the
gathering Progressive darkness. The game is to always put the other side
on defense. Make them defend every inch, while offering them a chance to
buy you off, for now. That’s the path to victory, but it will never be
easy. Beating back the Progs will make invading Russia in winter look
like a walk in the park. The Progs do not yield an inch. They will burn
everything before surrendering anything. What they have, they keep.
