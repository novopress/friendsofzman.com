**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about the proliferation of
rage heads who can only communicate in emotions, a post about how we
have become a nation of liars and the Sunday podcast. Subscribe

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The British conservative party, known as the Tories, finally settled on
a new leader after they were nearly zeroed out in the last election. The
pick to lead the party is a Nigerian woman calling herself Kemi
Badenoch. Her official name is Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch, but
that is far too British these days, so she has shortened it to a single
word “Kemi” like pop stars do. She is now the face of the party that is
supposedly the face of traditional English people.

The absurdity of this is obvious to most people, but not to everyone.
The people running the Tory party are over the moon with this. Many of
them are snickering into their sleeves about how the Labour party is
“pale, stale and male.” Other are sure that it will take a Nigerian
princess to restore British honor and finally confront the multicultural
forces that have turned Britain into a zoo. This is their version of
“Mexicans are natural conservatives”, popular with American
conservatives.

The ridiculousness of this does not stop there. Look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemi_Badenoch" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">career</a> of Kemi Badenoch through a traditional lens
and her resume is a baffling mix of things that have no connection to
one another or fit into a clear theme. She bounced from one thing to
another, never accomplishing much but then suddenly she became a hot
property among the consultancy class. That is where she was discovered
by the political class and turned into a Yoruba version of Barak Obama.

The parsimonious explanation for Kemi Badenoch’s shambolic rise to the
top of the Tory party is something John Derbyshire observed about Barak
Obama when he suddenly burst on the scene. What appears to be a random
walk preceding the meteoric rise is the result of the warm thermals
created by white guilt over race and the desires and projects to seek
forgiveness. The idealized black flits about until finally catching the
sharp upward gust into the clouds.

Upper and middle-class whites in the Anglosphere seem to be driven to do
these things, in part, by a desire to be ruled by Africans, who just
happen to agree with them or “hold their values”, as they prefer to
state it. There is also the desire to be punished by Africans, but not
so much as to cause them real harm. They prefer the harm to fall on the
bad whites. Then there is the strong undertow of salvation. These whites
believe that this process will lead to their salvation.

This explains the weird exultation we see from these whites when a
chosen one turns up to confirm the prophesies. The mania over Barak
Obama was so bizarre people compared it to the cult of personality seen
in places like North Korea. The Obama fans could tell you almost nothing
about him, but that did not matter as simply being in the mobs
worshipping him provided the religious experience they desired. You see
the same look among the Tory members regarding Kemi Badenoch.

It is easy to mock this, but this behavior is driven by strong cultural
and spiritual forces, and it is having a real impact. This phenomenon is
mostly a product of the United States, exported around the West. The
desire to build a city on a hill evolved into a sense of shame coupled
with a desire to heal the world. The result is something approaching
idolatry, with the well-behaved black person being treated like an
emissary of God, who must be allowed to perform his miracles.

It is not an accident that the script writers for Barak Obama had him
say things like “we are the ones we have been waiting for.” Many people
dismissed it as emotive nonsense, but the line has African origins. For
the intended audience, white, educated and upper-middle-class, the line
struck like a thunderclap. They were the elect and the proof of this was
their presence in the cult of Obama. Not only was the promised land
near, but salvation was also at hand.

Salvation never came and the result was a decade of madness. It is not
an accident that the street violence and other engineered destruction of
the basics of society started in the middle of Obama’s last term. At
that point, it was clear to all that salvation was not coming, so they
had no choice but to search for a villain. This sort of cult like
behavior never turns to self-reflection in the face of disconfirmation.
Instead, the energy in search of salvation channels into the search for
the devil.

It remains to be seen if this is the process in Old Blighty. The Tories
are in the political wilderness for a few more years. Labour, which won
the last election, is as popular as rectal cancer and faces nothing but
bad options. Britain is much closer to economic and social collapse than
anyone in power appreciates. Throw in the fact that Black Jesus is not
supposed to come from what passes for the right and it seems unlikely
that Kemi Badenoch will follow the Obama arc.

Instead, what this looks like is what we see all over the West these
days and that is a reboot of an old classic but done by ham and eggers.
The Tories, like their American counterparts, have reached the logical
end of what has passed for conservatism since the middle of the last
century. The only remaining constituency for conservatism is the
economic elites who seek to keep the old dialectic going. In the end,
this gambit will fail to change their political fortunes.

There is more to it though. This unsatisfied desire for forgiveness that
lies at the heart of this worship of Africans in the Anglosphere is not
going away, because there is no mechanism to achieve it. Christianity,
from which this desire was inherited, had mechanisms for forgiveness of
sin. It also had a logic to address those things for which forgiveness
in this life was not possible. The secular ideologies that rose up to
replace Christianity have no such mechanisms.

Each turn of the wheel has led to a more reckless pursuit of salvation,
because “more of the same” is the only possible answer to the inevitable
failure. It is why we have gone from the reasonable extension of legal
protections to former slaves to a world of unlimited non-white
immigration and the erasure of white people from the cultural spaces,
like movies, television and advertising. The burning desire to cleanse
their souls of this sin has led to the desire to burn it all down.

What this suggests is that the antidote to what is killing the West is
something that will lead the people to come down from their cross of
ebony and embrace a new moral framing which gives them a purpose that
elevates their people, rather than sacrificing them in search of
forgiveness. That is unlikely to be found in the past. Instead, it will
be found in the rubble of decline. At some point, even the fanatic must
submit to reality or at least be overcome by it and those who rise from
it.
