There are men who are remembered for what they did. There are men who
are remembered for what they said. Then there are men who are remembered
for who they have influenced or the chain events touched off by them.
This last group is unique for the simple reason it is hard to say
exactly why they are remembered. They are history’s version of the
popular figure who is famous for being famous. One such example is the
late philosopher, Leo Strauss.

That last sentence provides a clue as to why this mediocre philosopher
and historian is a figure who looms large of contemporary politics.
Serious students of philosophy take exception to calling Strauss a
philosopher. Historians dismiss him outright. Students of Greek
philosophy roll their eyes when they the man’s name. Even his followers
will spend hours debating how to properly label the man. Despite this
lack of distinction, Leo Strauss is an important figure in our politics.

For those looking for an accessible explainer on Leo Strauss and his
work, Paul Gottfried’s
[book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107675715?pldnSite=1), *Leo Strauss
and the Conservative Movement in America* is a straight forward summary
and analysis of the man and his work. For those looking for an even
shorter introduction to the topic, here is a good
[review](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2015/05/leo-strauss-the-rights-false-prophet.html)
of the book. At the end of that review, the reviewer touches on the
central question of Strauss. Why does this mediocre academic cast such a
long shadow?

The main reason anyone talks about Strauss is that his followers have
been central to American politics for half a century. His most famous
acolyte was Harry Jaffa, who created the cult of Lincoln that still
animates conventional conservatism. His reimagining of American history
allowed contemporary conservatives to get to the left of their opponents
on the issue of race. It is why the modern conservative cannot shut up
about Abraham Lincoln. He is their get out jail free card.

That does not explain why we have lots of middlebrow intellectuals
announcing themselves as Straussians rather than Jaffians. Modern
conservatism owes far more to Jaffa than Strauss, but the conservative
intellectual space is littered with people flying the flag of Leo
Strauss. Additionally, there are flavors of Straussianism, as in the
East Coast Straussians and the West Coast Straussians. What is so
magical about this man that half a century after his death he still
casts a shadow?

This is where Marx comes into the picture. Like Strauss, Marx was a
mediocre intellectual, but he cast a huge shadow. There were many smart
men working the communist and socialist circuits in the 19th century,
many smarter and more reasonable than Marx, but it was Marx who towered
over the rest. Despite having been wrong about pretty much everything,
Karl Marx remains a respected thinker and philosopher on the Left.

One reason Marx rose above the rest was that he provided intellectual
authority to the socialist movement. His theory of history turned a
collection of moral preferences into scientific fact, which gave the
believers an unquestionable authority upon which to base their economic
and political claims. To this day we hear people on the so-called Left
claim that they are on the right side of history. This means their
opponents are on the wrong side of history, so they can be dismissed.

Similarly, the Straussian method provides the believer with a set of
tools to instantly create the needed authority for their normative
claims. Strauss taught that you must learn the true intent of a writer.
The Straussian, of course, has the special skill to see through the
esoteric writing of genuine philosophers, who out of necessity always
cloak their real meaning from the casual reader. Strauss allows his
followers to divine the real meaning of historical texts.

At first this does not sound like much, but it allowed Harry Jaffa to
tease out the real thoughts of the Founders, which to that point had
been called the Framers, because they wrote the text of the
Constitution. Jaffa claimed that their real thoughts were contained in
the Declaration. From that he could turn the Founders into Moses and
Lincoln into Joshua. The former led his people out of bondage, but not
into the Promised Land, while the latter completed the journey.

That is a clever trick, but as Gottfried noted, this was not simply for
the amusement of bored intellectuals, but part of a political strategy.
By casting Lincoln as the real founder of the American republic,
conservatives, who were clustered in the Republican party, could claim
him as their own. Not only does the “great emancipator” become a shield
against the charge of racism, but he also becomes a license to turn
egalitarianism and the blank slate into conservative principles.

That is a major appeal of Strauss. His method provides a set of tools
for rhetorical combat within practical politics. The Straussian method
allows the user to flit from one tine of Hume’s fork to the other. They
can conflate those things that are axiomatically true with those things
that are contingently true. Decorated with their own interpretations of
Plato and Aristotle, gratuitous assertions become immutable fact. These
tools let the users win the debate, rather than reveal important truths.

Probably the main appeal of Strauss is the same as for Marx. For the
initiate, the system of thought provides a framework to answer every
question. This in turn elevates the believer’s sense of self. When you
are on the right side of history, you inevitably are filled with
confidence. When you can divine the intent of the great minds and use
this secret knowledge against your opponents, you become a god. The
appeal in both cases is spiritual, not intellectual.

The comparison between Marx and Strauss works because of the people who
were most attracted to the two men. The people who rallied to Marxism
were not the urban proletariat, but the urban bourgeois intellectuals.
Similarly, those rallying to Strauss are not highbrow political
thinkers. His appeal is to the middlebrow bourgeois intellectuals that
grow like a fungus on the modern age. Both provided a purpose to idle
men without an obvious role in life.

Ideas have consequences and bad ideas have bad consequences. That should
be the lesson of Marxism. Leo Strauss was a clever man, for sure, but
his bad ideas have given us a half century of political agitation and
subterfuge. One would think the embarrassing catastrophe that was the
Bush presidency would have relegated Strauss and his followers to the
dustbin of history, but when you are untethered from facts and reason,
the facts never get in the way of your next argument.
