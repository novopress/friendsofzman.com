A new [paper](https://lukasalthoff.github.io/jmp/althoff_jmp.pdf) on the
long term impact of slavery and Jim Crow is making the rounds with the
usual suspects. The paper claims to have studied the life outcomes of
black descendents of freedmen, which were the blacks who were out of
slavery before the start of Civil War. This group is then compared to
the descendents of those who were only made free after the Civil War.
The latter group has lower education, income, and wealth today than the
former group.

Steve Sailer has filled up the comments
[section](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/the-persistence-of-jim-crow-effects.html)
on the post about it at Marginal Revolution, telling the world it is not
nature or nurture. It is both. This is a favorite hobbyhorse of the
older HBD crowd. They seem to think this is a compromise their
detractors will accept. This is always wrong because their detractors
make moral arguments, for which there can be no compromise. For them it
is always nurture and those who say otherwise are evil.

The study assumes that those who were freed at the end of the Civil War
resided in states that eventually adopted Jim Crow laws. This deprived
them of things like education that were available to blacks in other
states. The other assumption is that blacks in the north had easy access
to education, while blacks in the South were not allowed to read. This
cartoon version of our social history is part of the larger morality
tale that drives the civic religion of the managerial class.

The big problem with this study is that we have to assume that the
freedman and the slave were cognitively equal, on average. That is a
rather big assumption that is not based in the historical record. We
have mountains of contemporaneous accounts suggesting that freedman were
extraordinary blacks who earned their freedom in various ways. Freedman
often continued in service to their former owner, but as a paid employee
rather than as a slave.

There is a better than average chance that the freedman in the 19th
century were significantly smarter than their enslaved counterparts.
Some may have been clever enough to escape and make a life in the north.
Others may have provided such great service to their owner that they
were freed as a reward. In other words, the descendents of freedmen may
have done better because their ancestors were smarter than the general
slave population that was eventually set free.

There is also the problem with assuming that Jim Crow deprived blacks in
the South of an education. We know that black illiteracy sharply
[declined](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c8792/c8792.pdf)
in the first half of the twentieth century. At the start of the century,
about a quarter of blacks in the South were literate, while 80% of
whites could read. By 1950 the gap had closed to a few points, which
says blacks were getting at least a basic education. Depending on the
study, it appears that black literacy has declined since 1950.

The far larger problem is the assumption that social policies cast a
shadow long after they have been eliminated. If we use 1965 as the end
of Jim Crow, then we are onto the third generation who never experienced
these laws. Despite the massive efforts to address the racial gaps, the
gaps remain. In some cases, like literacy and illegitimacy rates, the
gaps have grown larger. The whole cause and effect relationship starts
to fall apart quickly when you look at the data.

Even if we can adjust for all of these factors and make a case that
modern black people are suffering in some measurable way from ancient
polices, so what? If the point is to compensate them in some way, as the
restorative justice crowd demands, you create a moral contradiction that
cannot be resolved. Compensation is a contract imposed on at least two
parties to the contract. The side receiving it must accept and the side
providing it must also accept.

The logic of compensation starts with the assumption that one party is
at fault and caused measurable harm to the other party. Even if you wish
to pretend modern black people are victims of policies that have been
gone for generations, you cannot pretend that there is anyone alive
today who can be held liable. The slave owners have been dead for over a
century. They were all ruined in the Civil War. The creators of Jim Crow
have also been dead for generations.

Then you have the problem with compensation. For it to be just, it must
compensate the aggrieved party for measurable harm. There is no way to
compensate someone for hurt feelings or a loss of cultural pride. This
cannot be measured. Compensating someone for pain and suffering is a
convoluted way of punishing the guilty party in order to discourage the
offending behavior. The court fines the offending party and hands the
money to the victim.

Punishing modern white people for behavior they did not do in order to
prevent them from doing the thing they did not do is grotesquely
immoral. In one of life’s many ironies, it is similar to the German
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippenhaft" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">principle</a> of *Sippenhaft.* This is the claim that
the clan or family shares responsibility for the crimes of a member. The
difference is that there is no claim here that the group being punished
had any role in the alleged crime, because the alleged crime happened
generations ago.

Of course, logic and morality do not matter here. At least not the sort
of logic and morality that makes civilized life possible. People cook up
these papers because they serve the interests of the people who
underwrite this stuff. The audience for this material needs to believe
they are justified in their hatreds. Without a holy book or supernatural
authority, they are left to conjure some other justification for what
has evolved into an intergenerational blood feud.
