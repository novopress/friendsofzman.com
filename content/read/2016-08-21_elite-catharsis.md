[There’s a column in America’s newspaper of
record](http://nypost.com/2016/08/21/american-journalism-is-collapsing-before-our-eyes/)
explaining how in this election the major media is committing suicide in
an attempt to stop Donald Trump from winning the White House. This is a
bit of a hardy quadrennial as some element of the press complains about
the media in every presidential election. Usually it is the so-called
conservative media doing the complaining, but you get some of the
professional concern trolls wringing their hands over the bias. Whether
or not they are more biased this time around is hard to know as it is
hard to know if they can be more biased.

Even so, it does feel different this time. In past elections, the
liberal media started attacking the Republican after the conventions,
but their tactic was to appeal to the voters. That meant selling the
themes of the Democrat and making sport of the Republican. In 2008 they
kept reminding voters that Obama was dreamy and from Illinois just like
Lincoln. In 2012 they reminded voters that Romney was in a weird desert
cult and believed in magic underwear. In both cases the “reporting” was
intended to sway the voters.

This time is different in many ways. The obvious difference is the
so-called conservative media has locked shields with the liberal media
in opposing Donald Trump.  The two big conservative journals are
fanatically opposed to Trump. Fox News inadvertently made Trump’s
campaign by having their attack poodles ambush Trump at the first
debate. Even the usually reliable talk radio has been reluctant to back
Trump. That’s changing as they figure out which way the wind is blowing,
but guys like Glenn Beck are still waving the rainbow flag of
\#nevertrump.

The other way that things are different is in the tone of the coverage.
The major media is not talking to us or even lecturing us. They are
talking to one another. [A very good example is in this bizarre
editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/opinion/sunday/how-can-america-recover-from-donald-trump.html?ribbon-ad-idx=5&src=trending)
from a little paper in New York somewhere.

> Donald Trump is heading to November like a certain zeppelin heading to

The sneering tone is crude, even by the smug standards of the New York
Times, but it has a strange feel to it. It reads like the bargaining of
someone promising to be a better person, if they manage to escape the
dangerous situation. You don’t say those things for anyone but yourself
and maybe your maker. It’s a form of bargaining where you think having
had a revelation, you deserve a second chance at life. That’s how this
editorial reads. The Old Gray Lady is promising to be more responsible
if she can somehow escape the horror that is Donald Trump.

I think what we’re seeing here is the result of decades of insularity of
the political class. The people occupying positions in the media have
been divorced from the rest of us for so long, they are truly
revolted by us. All of the scary campfire stores they used to tell one
another about how the people in flyover country are just a bunch of
racist mouthbreathers has become their reality. They really think they
are under assault. All those times they called the Republican a Nazi is
feeling like a prophecy to them now. It’s the 1932 Weimar elections all
over again.

That’s the other thing that seems different about this election. It used
to be that the beautiful people were nice to our face, but they
privately looked down on the hoi polloi. In many cases, they felt sorry
for the normals. For better or worse, many of their social projects were
well intended, even if they ended in disaster. That’s not the case
today. The beautiful people really and truly hate the average American.
They barely tolerate us. It’s why the Old Gray Lady is writing these
revenge fantasies for after they have destroyed Trump.

This election is often cast as a revolt by the plebs, but it is really a
revolt of the elites. It’s as if they have used the rise of Trump as an
excuse to open up about how they really feel about traditional America.
They finally have an excuse to let those hillbillies speaking “frontier
gibberish” know exactly where they stand. You really see this on the
Right. All across elite conservative media we see spasm of hatred toward
those they used say they represented. Kevin Williamson at National
Review even wrote a weird fantasy article about how poor whites should
die.
