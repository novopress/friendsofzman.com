The sales pitch for the American political system is that it is a robust
debate between two distinct political parties. The Republicans and
Democrats are coalitions of interests opposed to one another. The groups
that make up each party are held together by a shared ideological
outlook. The Republicans are the conservative party, and the Democrats
are the liberal party. The political process adjudicates the disputes
between the parties over public policy and the result is a compromise.

In reality, America is a one party system. It has been since Gettysburg.
The differences between the two parties are miniscule. This is why
public policy never changes when the party in charge changes. The mild
reforms of the Reagan years were followed by a consensus that remains in
place to this day. There is some tinkering around the edges to keep up
appearances, but otherwise the results of each election have no impact
on public policy or the priorities of government.

As for those two ideologies, they are just two faces of a single ruling
class ideology that is something like a religion now. There is
left-liberalism and there is right-liberalism held together by a common
moral framework. Like the old Bolsheviks, the left side of the American
ideology is maximalist and radical. It wants to usher in the promises of
the revolution right now. The right side is more cautious, preferring an
evolutionary approach to ushering in the promised utopia.

Unlike the old communists, the American ideology has always existed in a
popular political system, so it is built to sell itself to the public.
The main role of the right-liberals is to protect the left-liberals from
themselves. They function as barrier between the tenets of the one true
faith and any questioning of the faith. The left side is the heart of
the beast, driving the agenda and pushing society along from one fad to
the next, always chasing the avatar of egalitarian paradise.

This arrangement has worked amazingly well. Perhaps too well. It has
been over a century since there has been a threat to the system.
Anarchists and communists at the start of the last century started to
get some traction, but they were never really a threat to the basic
arrangements. Otherwise, it has been smooth sailing for the uniparty
system for generations. The left-liberals are free to dream up new
social innovations without being disturbed and the right stands quietly
at guard.

The trouble is the party is looking like a freak show inside a hot
house. For example, the Air Force now has [drag
shows](https://summit.news/2021/06/23/u-s-air-force-base-says-drag-queen-show-was-essential-for-morale/)
to boost morale. To normal people, this is completely nuts (pun
intended), but to the people in charge it is perfectly normal. In fact,
they think it is bizarre that anyone would question it. They are not
entirely wrong, as the people who arranged it will never be pressed on
it. The politicians all agree that drag queens are who we are now, and
the press echoes the sentiment.

Where the ruling orthodoxy finds itself is in a place where there is
never a need to explain themselves and defend their positions. The
right-liberals never challenge the left-liberals on orthodoxy. Both
sides just put on shows where they pretend to disagree, but then kick
back together after the show to laugh about it. The right-liberals have
insulated themselves from defending their position. They [tell
themselves](https://archive.is/wlmFL#selection-239.1-243.11) that they
are simply too good to discuss these things with their critics.

The folks at the Daily Wire are supposed to be the smart kids of
conservatism, but they spend their days making sure the hothouse is
airtight. Ben Shapiro’s one venture outside the tightly controlled
environment of his life ended in
[disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VixqvOcK8E). Ever since that
public relations debacle his people have made sure that no one can utter
a discouraging word in his presence. In fact, that whole scene has
become a closed shop, never interacting with anyone outside their hive.

It is not just the pundits who have become hot house flowers. Look at
what happens to the military leaders when they go before Congress. [This
guy](https://twitter.com/dave_brown24/status/1407745748909838343) went
before Congress and told one whopper after another. To outsiders, he
looks like a complete fool, but inside that room he is just par for the
course. Anyone reading this could have wrecked him with a few simple
questions, but no one in the room has the intelligence or the
temperament to question anything.

This is the motivation behind the mass censorship and de-platforming.
The people inside the political system are incapable of defending or
even discussing their positions and they live in fear of having to do
it. It is not so much that the critics have great arguments or have
superior debating skills. That is a silly conceit. It is simply that the
people outside the system, the dissidents, are comfortable defending
their positions and discussing them in public. They can take a punch.

This underlying sense of weakness is probably what lies behind the
persecution of the January protestors. January 6th, from the perspective
of the ruling class, was an emperor has no clothes moment. The torture
and torment of the protestors is as much about reassuring themselves
that they are tough and in charge as it is about sending a message to
the Dirt People. The ruling class revealed themselves to be cowards and
now they are lashing out in a fit of petty spite.

All ruling elites have an abundance of sissies and ridiculous people.
They are the entertainment and decoration for the serious men who run
things. Those serious men are made serious by regular contact with
reality. Remove that contact and those serious men become as silly and
ridiculous as their retainers. That is where the empire finds itself
now, ruled by fops and popinjays living in a hothouse. They live in fear
of someone opening the door and letting in reality.
