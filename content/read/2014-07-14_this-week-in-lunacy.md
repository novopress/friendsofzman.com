in the New York Times. Since the onset of this hysteria, the lunatics
are crafting an imaginary past in which homosexuals were kept on
lavender farms in the south. Like blacks, who Progressives claim to have
liberated, homosexuals were forced to slave away on the lavender farms
as chattel. That makes the obsession with homosexuals today an analog to
the Civil Rights Movement.

*Glenn Burke was 27 when he walked out on Major League Baseball, his
promising career as an outfielder undone mostly by the burden of being a
semicloseted gay man. It was 1980, and it was more important, Burke
later explained, to be himself than to be a professional baseball
player.*

It turns out he sucked at baseball too.

When you hit .237 over six seasons, the game walks away from you, not
the other way around. He was not the first washed up ball player to
blame the unfairness of life for his busted dreams. The barrooms of
America are full of guys who never got over washing out of sports. They
never made it to the bigs and have a million reasons for it other than
they were not good enough.

You would think a reporter would look up the stats, but that’s not how
the modern media works these days. First they create the narrative and
then they fill in the facts. It’s not a lot different from how the
Soviets would airbrush people in and out of photos. When you think
everything including observable reality must be bent toward reaching the
promised land, silly things like facts are not going to stop you.
