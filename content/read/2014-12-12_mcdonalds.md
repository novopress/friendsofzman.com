It has been a long time since I’ve looked closely at the McDonald’s
menu. When I was a boy, the the menu was pretty simple. They had
hamburgers, cheeseburgers and the fish sandwich. On the rare occasion
when I eat there, I still get a cheeseburger and a fish sandwich. Maybe
I’ll do the one dollar chicken sandwich. Otherwise, I could not name
five things on their menu. I suppose they still sell the Big Mac and
fries, but the rest is a mystery I’m happy to ignore.

<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story on Yahoo</a> tells me they
have 121 items on their menu. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but
maybe they are counting things like ketchup packs. Still, how in the
world did they let that happen? The whole point of fast food is it is
simple, cheap, fast and consistent. The fish sandwich in Boston as in
Minneapolis. It generally costs the same and is delivered the same.
Given the general stupidity of the American people, 121 offerings just
means it will undermine the whole effort.

In California, there is a chain called
<a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In ‘N
Out Burger</a>. They offer a cheeseburger, a hamburger, a double burger
and fries. The food is good, the service is quick and the experience is
consistent from restaurant to restaurant. It is what McDonald’s used to
be fifty years ago. Chick-fil-A is the same concept, except they do not
permit homosexuals in their stores.  Anytime I see one of these
restaurants, they are packed. It turns out that McDonald’s was right the
first time. People don’t like diversity.

It is the great lie of modern times that people like options. That’s
nonsense. People are social animals. We like belonging to a group.
That’s our nature. It’s why there are Pepsi drinkers and Coke drinkers.
We have two types of cola. Then we have the oddball stuff for the
weirdos, but it is a tiny market. When was the last time you heard
someone order an RC Cola or a Moxie? No, people like a few choices so we
can divide ourselves up into simple groups. Otherwise, diversity is
always a bad thing.
