Afghanistan debacle. There is a pattern here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the last week, the world has watched the great project of the
American empire fall to pieces as if it was a controlled demolition. The
Taliban has swept across Afghanistan, facing little more than token
resistance from the official government. In fact, the official
government fled the country without even pretending to care. As of
Sunday evening, the U.S. government was scrambling to figure out how to
evacuate the people with American citizenship while begging the Taliban
for relief.

This week, regime elements will be playing the blame game, no doubt
settling on the previous administration as the real culprit. Faced with
disconfirmation of their beliefs, the new religion of our rulers
triggers a process whereby they are convinced that the latest setback is
actually part of the great plan. It is a sort of test of faith and the
only way to get past it and continue the flow of history is to believe
harder. In time, this will become a bloody shirt in the way Vietnam was
for a generation.

Putting that aside, the collapse of the Afghan model reveals some things
about the ruling regime that are useful to dissidents. The big lesson is
that the Washington regime never felt it necessary to subvert the
culture of Afghanistan. Instead, they spent twenty years celebrating it.
Sure, they did the superficial stuff like flying the flags of various
sexual deviants over the embassy, but they never tried to impose it on
the Afghans in the same was we see them do it to white Americans.

If the Afghans were white, the empire would have accused them of Afghan
privilege or maybe Afghan supremacy then set about destroying their
culture. There would have been gay imams in rainbow colored tunics
preaching about how Muhamad was really into sodomy. Of course, there
would have been a heavy emphasis on women’s sports, perhaps fielding an
all lesbian soccer team. None of that happened because that would have
been insulting to the Afghans and their ways.

The big thing that the empire did not do that they are doing in their
alleged home base of America is replace the people. A big part of the
war on whiteness is the importation of millions of nonwhites into white
countries. It is part of the dialectic made real, where mass immigration
is the negation of white culture. The empire could have done this in
Afghanistan with no trouble. There are a billion Africans looking for a
better deal, so they could have imported some of them to celebrate
diversity.

That really is the telling feature of the twenty year occupation. The
rules in place over there were the exact opposite of the rules in place
over here. There was no systematic statue toppling, no mass media
campaigns against Afghan culture and no chanting about diversity being a
strength. One could be forgiven for thinking that the people in charge
of the American empire have more respect for Afghan culture and Afghan
people than they have for the American people and their culture.

These are things most people probably knew, if they took the time to
think about it, but the events of last weekend provide a good reminder.
In the weeks to come, the ruling class will care more about the fortunes
of people in Afghanistan than the victims of their opioid crisis they
inflicted on rural America. They will work harder to preserve the
“rights” of collaborators left behind in Kabul than the rights of
American being held in dungeons around Washington. They hate us that
much.

The useful lesson in all of this is these people have once again
revealed that they really do believe their own nonsense. The old paleos
remain convinced that the elites know their preaching is all nonsense,
but the Afghan debacle is proof that they do get high from their own
supply. The plan was to celebrate the exit on 9/11 as “mission
accomplished” and then forget about the whole thing. Biden would get
credit for finishing Obama’s project and ending the Bush war.

Over the weekend, their lack of preparation was on display, as the
regime media was not provided with a script to follow. Instead, they
were allowed to think for themselves, a dangerous prospect under ideal
conditions. They sent <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/former-cia-officer-most-infamous-devastating-press-conference-ever-held-american"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Biden</a> out to take questions not
vetted in advance and it was another humiliation. The sight of an eighty
year old man struggling to do the basics is symbolic of the empire. Like
Biden, it is old, senile, and operating on the fumes of past glories
that never really happened.

This is not the first time the ruling elite have fallen for their own
rhetoric. Back in the Obama years, they were sure the summer of 2010 was
going to be “recovery summer” for the economy. They even had a <a
href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/06/17/a-summer-recovery"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">campaign</a> all ready to go. That ended
the same way the Afghan withdraw ended. Recall that Biden promised this
summer would be the end of the Covid panic. Everyone would get to party
again. The prophesies of the new religion have a bad habit of never
coming true.

Of course, the big lesson in all of this is that a small, dedicated
minority can win against all odds if they refuse to surrender. The irony
of the American foreign policy establishment not remembering the story
of David and Goliath is one of those things that tells us something
about the people in charge. They are just so sure they are on the right
side of history, that they never take a moment to consider their role in
it. They were the Goliath this time and the Afghans were the David.

Granted, the American military would happily abandon the rules of
engagement they labored under in Afghanistan when it comes to whiteness.
You can be sure General Milley has a speech ready about how white rage
is really a part of some secret connected between white people and the
Taliban. That said, men living as they did when Alexander the Great was
in Afghanistan fought the mighty U.S. Military to a draw and then drove
them from their lands. An inspiration to us all.

In the end, this is how dying empires look from the inside. The people
at the top fear self-examination, so they commit to a zealous form of
the mentality that made the empire possible in the first place. The
empire and their place atop it are the center of their belief system and
no disconfirmation will shake that belief. They will die with the empire
that makes them possible. What comes next is up to the people who
survive the inevitable collapse in order to fill the void of empire.
