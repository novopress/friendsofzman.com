The news brings word that the grand jury will be making its decision
today. Everyone expects a no-bill and <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">everyone expects a riot</a>.

*Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and
stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jury’s decision about
whether to charge a white police officer who fatally shot a black
18-year-old in suburban St. Louis.*

*The preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence
during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an
announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face
a criminal trial for the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown.*

*Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which
prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics. Images
of officers in riot gear and armored vehicles confronting protesters
have drawn widespread criticism.*

*Many protesters want Darren Wilson indicted for murder. Grand jury
proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked
information about Wilson’s testimony to investigators may be an attempt
to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged.*

*The decision could be made public within the next month.*

*In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for
interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their
procedures for quick, widespread arrests. They plan to have a large
contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy,
community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that
could ease tensions on the streets.*

I’m just so damned tired of catering to these savages. Instead of
spending millions to make sure the gentle little snowflakes rioting in
the streets don’t get their “rights” violated, how about we stand up for
civilization for a change. Let everyone in Ferguson know that their
little slice of heaven will be sealed off before the announcement. You
can riot your brains out, but no one is coming in or out. No one will
come in to put out fires, tend to the injured, deliver food, fix a
broken pipe, etc.

Once the rioting ends, the siege will be lifted.
