The funny thing about conspiracy theories is they are a fairly good
measure of both social trust and trust in civic institutions. In
societies with low trust and corrupt government, people tend to assume
things are not as they seem. In high trust societies, people tend to
accept things at face value. They also tend to accept what is told to
them by the authorities, rather than assume they are lying.

Before the Russian revolution, conspiracy theories were common. Of
course, lots of people were conspiring to topple the system, but people
assumed that the system itself was not as it was presented. Of course,
the Great Fear was a period in the French Revolution where rumors and
conspiracy theories about the aristocracy ran wild, ultimately leading
the storming of the Bastille.

We seem to be entering a similar phase. People are more likely to
believe a rumor about Biden taking bribes than to believe anything he
says. For a growing portion of the public, it is assumed that everything
that comes from the regime is a lie. The use of the word “regime” is a
huge change. It is a word that implies rule by men rather than rule by a
system of laws, customs, and institutions.

Of course, it is not helped by the fact that the president is a
doddering old fool who barely knows where he is most of the time. The
absurdity of this man being in charge of anything raises the question
about who is calling the shots. That leads to wondering why they are
using a decrepit old man as a puppet. Before long you are down the
rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and shadowing actors.

The coming election will give rise to more conspiracy theories. When a
regime begins arresting its opponents, only desperate toadies believe
what it says. This leaves the field open to alternative explanations for
what is happening. We are entering that phase that occurs before every
great period of unrest. The age when rumors and conspiracy sound more
convincing than observable reality.
