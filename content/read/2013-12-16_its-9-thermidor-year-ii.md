For those of you not up on your revolutionary history, that is the date
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thermidorian Reaction</a>. In
radical circles, it has a different meaning. It is the inflection point
in radical politics where the movement veers off into madness. The
otherwise sensible people who were pushing the movement along begin to
have doubts and question the people they have been following. The
revolution, at this point, begins to eat itself, as radicals seek out
doubters and the sober minded react to the craziness of the radicals.

For more than 200 years radicals have been replaying the French
Revolution hoping for a different result. In every case, the radicals
never see that they are following the same path as those who came before
them. It suggest there is something about radicalism, maybe a biological
quality to the radicals themselves, that results in this pattern. For
some reason, they can never see that they are following the same story
arc as prior radical movements, even when they are led by people who are
students of prior radical movements.

Anyway, I first heard it is used when reading about the
<a href="http://berkeleycitizensaction.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Berkeley Citizens Action</a> struggles in the 1980’s.
The New Left settled into the city and went about building a a radical
organization. They used a document called
<a href="http://jph.sagepub.com/content/11/2/160.abstract"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The City’s Wealth</a> to map
out a strategy to gain control of Berkeley, which they eventually did in
the 1980’s. That’s when Berkeley got into declaring itself a nuclear
free zone and campaigning for various communist causes in South America.
It is also when the city’s schools and quality of life began to
collapse.

The radicals were so concerned about polishing their radical credentials
and debating their radical theories with one another, they failed to
figure out how to run a practical organization. They also started
succumbed to the normal human temptations, like getting their money
mixed up with the city’s money. Eventually the city’s less crazy liberal
population revolted and started to throw out the radicals. Left-wing
observers on the West coast called it America’s *Thermidorian Reaction*.

That may be what’s happening with the Affordable Care Act. It was the
crowning achievement of the Left’s capturing of the national government
in 2008. Five years on it is an <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unfolding disaster</a> that is
threatening the revolution. On the one hand, the old school types like
Bernie Sanders are unhappy about the bill not going far enough. They
were never happy about this, but hoped it was a first step. The liberals
who are more concerned with practical politics are in a full blown panic
as their poll numbers collapse.

On the other hand, this may signal the collapse of the more pragmatic
wing of the Left, the wing led by people like the Clintons. They may be
crooks, but they come out of the moderate strain of 60’s radicalism,
that thought this government could be re-purposed to Progressive ends.
The other wing, the anti-white wing, is not all that interested in
reforming the system. They wish to sack it and then attack their white
oppressors. They may see this failure as the failure of pragmatism and
then demand more radical action.
