Every once in a while, I stumble upon a topic idea that vexes me because
I am not sure where to go with it. A month or so ago I stumbled upon a
Jordan Peterson video in which he explained why Jews are so successful
in America. It was a bizarre thing that presented many jumping off
points. Then the video disappeared from YouTube, as he no doubt has
minions policing the site, so I went looking for it elsewhere.

I did not find it, but I found <a
href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">something</a> similar that he wrote on
his site back when he was being stalked by alt-right types asking him
about Jews at his events. What came to mind was a
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16493" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> from five years ago where I used Stefan
Molyneux and Scott Adams to explain the sophist of ancient Athens. For
some reason that brought to mind this <a
href="https://im1776.com/2024/08/18/the-american-nation-resurrections/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> on the site IM1776.

It seemed like there should be a show about sophistry there or maybe a
long post on the topic of <a
href="https://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_31/moeller_december2022.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">profilicity</a> which is related. The
trouble is the topic is probably too big for a thousand-word post and
maybe not big enough for a show. Anyway, I decided to wing on a show and
let the chips fall where they may. That means the show will either be
cheered as one of my best or jeered as one of my worst.

Something that did not occur to me while doing the show is that certain
topics have become sophists tests. In fact, in retrospect I should have
called the show that and made the show about the topics that flush out
the sophist from the crowded field of people who present themselves as
analysist and critics. If you cannot manage topics related to race or
ethnicity, for example, you are a faker.

We got a taste of this in the vice president debate when Walz started
ranting about how Finland has low crime but lots of guns. The online
audience erupted in “what else does Finland not have?” while others
remained puzzled by the question. If you know the answer, you know the
truth, but if you do not know the answer or cannot understand the
question, then you a faker or simply ignorant.
