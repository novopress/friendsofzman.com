For a while now I have wanted to do a post on the intellectual origins
of these rather weird political theatrics we are seeing in the public
space. A mistake our side tends to make is to assume the Left is not
working from an intellectual foundation. Because the Left never talks
about their intellectual history, we just assumed it does not exist,
outside of Marx or maybe some feminist writers. That’s not true. What we
are seeing today is the culmination of a mode of thought that started a
century ago in the interwar years.

It’s only one facet of it, but it is an important one. A point that
cannot be made enough is that what we call Progressivism is a religion,
a civic religion of sorts, but increasingly an esoteric mystery cult.
The attraction for the modern Progressive is purely emotional and
temporal. It is all about how the swirling torrent of Progressive fads
makes them feel in the moment and how it makes them feel in relation to
one another as initiates in the cult. What the show is about this week
is taking a look at the sources of this phenomenon.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
