Note: There is a cornucopia of new items in various places today. There
is the regular

that will be a regular Sunday feature. There is also a

which may be the most Jewish movie ever made.

One of the interesting side bars to the Covid panic is the extreme lack
of interest in the origin of the virus. The story a year ago was that it
sprung from so-called “wet markets” where provincials trade exotic
meats. One version said it was from bats and another claimed it was the
pangolin. Then the story shifted to the lab in Wuhan where the outbreak
started. That was dropped as the Chinese Communist Party instructed the
American media to stop talking about the lab in Wuhan.

Conventional wisdom says the wet market stuff was always just a way to
divert attention from the fact that the Chinese have a bioweapons
operation. The Biological Weapons Convention not only prohibits the use
of biological agents, but it also prohibits the development of them as
well. In light of the worldwide panic over the Covid virus, it is not
hard to see why everyone is trying to shift the focus from the lab to
exotic meat markets. This public health emergency could easily become a
political crisis.

The thing is though, the lab itself and the work that is probably going
on there is really just the tip of the iceberg. What the story has
revealed thus far is that many Western researchers have had contact with
that lab and several others in China. There have been a few arrests of
researchers in the West on the grounds they were working on behalf of
the Chinese or spying for the Chinese. In other words, there are a lot
of Western scientist working in China for some reason.

The reason gets back to that lab in Wuhan. There is no doubt that most
Western governments operate biological research facilities. The fact
that China is doing the same is no surprise. The difference is Western
governments have to worry about whistleblowers who will spill the beans
on anything illegal. They also have to worry about anything unethical.
The Chinese, in contrast, arrests whistleblowers and harvest their
organs. Scandal is not a concern for the ChiComs.

Western bioethics are not a big concern either. Last week, a team of
researchers working in China <a
href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/cp-rgh040821.php"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> they took six-day-old
macaque monkey embryos and injected 25 human cells into each of them.
The researchers claimed they conducted this study as part of an effort
to discover new methods of creating organs. The idea is to use the
patient’s DNA to grow new parts. This would not only solve the organ
shortage, it would also solve the challenge of finding suitable matches.

The ethics are the obvious concern. In the West, this type of research
is considered unethical because it raises questions that we have yet to
answer. What if such a hybrid was brought to term? Should a monkey with
a significant number of human cells be treated as human or as an animal?
Even if it is clearly an animal, deliberately creating monsters just to
do it is also unethical. We use animals in lab experiments, but it is
not just for the thrill of tormenting them. There needs to be reason.

Again, bioethics are not a concern for China. What matters most to the
Chinese is acquiring as much technology as possible as quickly and
cheaply as possible. This is why China has become the wild west of
bio-research. Western researchers know they can do whatever they want in
China. They will be free of Western ethics and get all the money they
need. They just have to share their work with their new masters. For
many Western scientists, this is not a difficult dilemma.

Of course, they cannot be blatant about it. When the world complained
about the use of CRISPR to create the world’s first
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00001-y"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">genetically altered baby</a>, the Chinese
arrested the researchers involved and sent them to prison. The message
being sent was that the research is fine, but it needs to have a Western
face attached. In other words, the imported researchers from the West
are not just bringing technical skills, they are providing China with
some public relations assistance.

What the Chinese have figured out is they can use the same methods on
the Western scientific community as they used to lure Western
manufacturers. The promise of cheap labor and loose environmental laws,
along with subsidies from the Chinese government, lured business from
the West. Sure, it often meant that local Chinese firms pirated the
products they were making for Western companies, but that was just a
cost of doing business in China. It was still good business.

The tech industry fell for the same deal. They were initially lured to
China in order to build out the infrastructure. They got access to a
pool of smart engineers, who worked for pennies on the dollar, relative
to American engineers. They also got the sweet contracts from the
government. The tech companies also got to learn the finer points of
population control from the Chinese. This was good business for the
Chinese, who were able to accelerate their tech sector.

Some would argue that China is simply freer now than most Western
nations, which is why intellectual capital is flowing there. If the
Chinese are fine with creating human-monkey hybrids in the lab, then so
be it. After all, human medicine advanced to a great degree from grave
robbers supply corpses for doctors to dissect. In the 19th century this
was immoral, but today we think nothing of it. Bioethics are a social
construct and as such they will evolve over time. China is just ahead of
the curve.

Whether we like it or not, we will soon learn if those ethical
limitations popular in the West are necessary. The Chinese will keep
forging ahead, buying Western researchers so they can experiment in the
East. Maybe Covid was the wake-up China needed to put some limits on
this research. Maybe it was just viewed as the cost of becoming the
dominant player in the field. Maybe that cost will be regular pandemics
of man-made viruses leaking from Chinese labs.

Most important, what we are seeing is what happens when a society
decides that the value of everything is what someone will pay for it. In
America, everything has a price, so nothing has value. The elites are
happy to trade technology to China, because the only thing that matters
is short term profit. From the Chinese perspective, the American empire
is not a competitor. It is just a big candy store that she can
systematically pick clean until it finally collapses. This is the war
China knows it can win.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
