The show this week finishes up what I started last week. As is often the
case, there was a lot I left out for time reasons. Reading about the
Bolsheviks led me to reading a lot of Marxist writing, which inevitably
led to reading some of the 20th century stuff that forms the basis of
the cultural revolution. It has been a long time since I read the source
material and I forgot much of it. It would be easy to do a series of
shows on someone like Antonio Gramsci, for example.

One of the difficult things about doing overviews of this material is
that so much of it relies on nonsense. It makes assumptions about the
human condition that are at odds with reality, then it builds an
imaginary world on top of it. The people attracted to it never see the
nonsense, because they want the rest of it to be true. Read 20th century
political philosophy and you quickly come to the conclusion that human
society needs an official religion that is enforced without
equivocation.

It reminds me of something Ed Dutton said about the sorts of people
drawn to things like anti-fascism. They have disorganized, chaotic minds
and need the structure of religion to focus their energy onto something
useful. When religion faded, what replaced it was ideology, which
focuses their energy on their fellow citizens, who they see as enemies
of their new faith. The same impulses that gave us cathedrals now gives
us mobs tearing down statues hoping for some grace.

This coincides with the fact that western man started getting dumber
around the same time that Christianity started to fade. The intellectual
history since that point has been about finding a suitable replacement.
The body count suggests we were better off with the old gods. The search
for new gods has been a disaster. This current search will no doubt lead
to tears. Perhaps the right answer will be that we pick a form of
Christianity and make it the basis of a theocracy.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
