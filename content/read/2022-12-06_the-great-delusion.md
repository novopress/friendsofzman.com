**Note:** If you are wondering what to buy the little woman for
Christmas this year, consider something from our friends at
<a href="https://www.minterandrichterdesigns.com/" rel="noopener"

in your life something cool he can wear in public lets the hussies know
he is taken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you are the CEO of a large corporation and you have to make a
big decision about a critical issue facing the company. Your team in the
C-suites have been busy putting together all of the information they can
about the issue. There have been meetings and presentations on all
aspects of the issue. Experts have been brought in to explain various
aspects of the issue. After having digested all of the information on
the issue, it is now time to act. What do you do?

Obviously, the right answer, even without knowing any of the details
about the issue in this hypothetical, is to put it up to a vote. First,
you will have the various sides on the issue make their case to the
employees. Maybe have a series of Zoom debates and let the parties put
up posters around the offices. Perhaps the principles representing the
various positions will have an all hands on deck meeting. At some point,
you have the employees log in and cast their vote.

Of course, this is ridiculous. No company would ever do such an insane
thing, at least not in this age. In the 19th century there were some
efforts to create socialist companies, but they ended poorly. Usually,
these democratic companies were part of a utopian society. In the modern
age, no one thinks the principles of democracy have any place in
something important like a corporation. The truth is the commies were
right about American business. It runs on fascist principles.

It is not just major corporations that avoid democracy. There is no
military in this world that embraces democracy. The nearest thing to
democracy in warfare was the pirate ship, which often voted on where to
plunder. Even on a pirate ship, there was a captain who made the big
decisions. His men might “vote him off the ship” but they would quickly
elect a new captain. Otherwise, every military on the planet has a
vertical chain of command and no democratic principles.

A good rule of life is that when any organization reaches sufficient
size to employ a full time leader, it employs a full time leader. A
small group of men working to a common goal might operate from a
consensus, but even in small groups someone is the de facto leader to
whom everyone looks for the final decision. It is fair to say that an
organization without a leader is unnatural. Human beings, even women,
always organize around a leader, even when everyone is agreement.

This natural lack of democracy is most evident in science. If someone
comes along claiming that he has discovered a new element, the science
men do not call together a meeting and vote on the claim. The claim must
be backed with proof and that proof is analyzed and challenged to verify
it. Despite what the Gaia worshippers say, consensus only exists within
science where proof is not present. The word “consensus” is a signal of
doubt, not proof of the claim.

A good rule of life is that anything important is excluded from anything
resembling the democratic process. No business runs on democratic lines.
Armies do not run according to democratic principles. Those two areas
are arguably two of the most important bits of any human society and
they run according to fascist principles. Even family life avoids
democracy as much as possible. The expression “head of the household”
exists because households naturally have a leader.

If one wants to understand why voting is a pointless waste of time, you
just have to ask why no important things are ever put to a vote?
Immigration is arguably the most important issue facing the country.
Politicians avoid it like the plague. Even the “good politicians” speak
in tongues when the issue is raised. Meanwhile, they
[scheme](https://archive.ph/m5wPj) in private to do what they know is
against the interests of the people. No one voting for it will dare
mention it when on the campaign trail.

The fact is our elections are meaningless. The candidates speak in vague
terms about abstract items. It is all in-group/out-group signaling. “We
have to secure our southern border” is just echolalic babbling used to
titillate a certain population. “We need affordable healthcare for all”
is emotive noise for different people. None of the things candidates say
while campaigning has anything to do with how they will vote once in
office or the policies that will become law.

You could easily replace the people with colored blocks of wood. How
would the current Georgia senate election be any different if the choice
were between red block of wood and blue block of wood? Alternatively,
the candidates could be replaced with lights that flash different colors
in response to different noises. Say the word “immigration” and one
light flashes green and the other flashes red. The expensive humans
could be replaced with cheap robots.

The reason our elections are meaningless, of course, is that no human
society ever subjects important things to democracy. The old joke about
if voting mattered, they would not let us do it was funny because it is
true. There is no correlation between public opinion and public policy.
This
[study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B)
from 2014 went through 1800 issues and found no link between what the
people told the politicians they wanted and what the politicians
eventually did.

If nothing important is ever subjected to democracy and democracy never
results in the public will manifesting in public policy, then why are
people hooked on the act of voting and why is democracy an object of
worship. Based on observation it appears there is no argument that can
be made to convince the bulk of the people to end this absurd charade we
call voting. Suggest a boycott of the process and the typical suburban
peasant gives you a sermon about democracy.

Compounding this bizarre worship of democracy is that most modern people
live a third of their lives as fascists. The self-employed person has
almost disappeared from the labor market. Small business is following
the self-employed into the abyss as big business dominates the
marketplace. That means most people work in companies that operate along
fascist principles. If half of your waking life is committed to fascism,
how in the world has democracy become an object of worship?

Societies can have moments of madness. The 1970’s saw America embrace
leisure suits and disco, while cities were turned into war zones. Much
of that period has been politely forgotten because no one can make sense
of it. Maybe this age and its fetish from democracy is something
similar. The chanting about democracy and obsession with politics is
another fit of madness. Instead of afros and sideburns we have brain
damaged hobos in the Senate and black Nazis.

Alternatively, this great delusion about the importance of participating
in elections is a form of escapism. As people become more dependent on
the system for the basics of their lives, they need to believe they have
some say in how the big machine that is the modern society runs their
life. Democracy and the various identity cults are a way to feel like
you have control when you are effectively living as a prisoner.
Democracy lets the inmates feel they are in charge of the asylum.
