One of the oddities of the Obama administration was that it seemed as if
they were working from a list of wrongs they were determined to right.
Those wrongs were what the Left counted as their failures over the
decades. A part of Obama being viewed as Black Jesus was his ability to
heal the past. This was necessary as those old harms were what tied us
to the present. It was only by righting those past wrongs that we could
break free and enter the glorious future.

The most obvious example was the health care stuff. This proved to be a
disaster for the Clinton administration, but that is not how the Left
saw it. They viewed it as a betrayal and a defeat that had to be
addressed. This is why the eventual policy was nothing like they
promised or anything anyone would call reform. That was never the point
of the exercise. The point was to have a redo of that old defeat and
this time the good guys would win and erase that loss from memory.

This active revisionism turned up in all sorts of places. They had

rel="noopener" target="_blank">pose</a> with Sergey Lavrov holding a red
button. This was part of the Russian reset initiative designed to
restart relations with Russia. In reality it was about soothing the
wounds from the Reagan years when the Left lost the Cold War debate. The
same vibe permeated their Iran initiative. Like the Russian reset, the
Iran reproachment had no utility in the present. It was all about the
past.

This backward-looking politics is plain now. The retreat into the past
has jumped from the establishment Left to the establishment Right. This
is not surprising, given the conservative habit of following the Left
from one fad to the next. <a
href="https://www.freedomconservatism.org/p/freedom-conservatism-a-statement"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> you have a collection of
flunkies from Conservative Inc. doing cosplay. Instead of dressing up as
characters from Japanese cartoons, they are pretending to be their
favorite characters from the conservative movement.

<a href="https://twitter.com/MartianOrthodox/status/1680364501412069376"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Someone</a> on Twitter referred to these
people as Reagan Van Winkles. They went to sleep in the 1980’s and just
awoke in the present, unaware of all that has happened over the last
forty years. It is a clever line and there is certainly some truth to
it, but these people are aware of the present. What they want is to go
back to sleep and wake up in the 1980’s, as if the present is a terrible
nightmare. They are live action role playing in order to take a timeout
from the present.

Note the flavorless language. Sixty years ago, when the founders of the
Buckley cult were getting started, they used language designed to
inflame the passions of the great white middle-class, which they sensed
was quietly seething at the cultural changes that had been unleashed by
the Left. The language in that statement is so devoid of human passion
that is could have been written by software. The point is not to excite
the reader, but to put him asleep so he can dream of better times.

What makes this stuff weirder is that most of the people doing it are
not old people trying to relive their youth. Nostalgia is understandable
for old people, especially those nearing the end of their career. These
people are experiencing anemoia, a nostalgic sense of longing for a past
they have never lived. None of the “signatories” of that goofy list of
principles were alive when Buckley started his cult. Many of them were
barely aware of the world during the Reagan years.

On the other side of the old political consensus is hauntolgy, a sense
that unfinished business from the past is haunting the present. Like
Banquo’s ghost, the old failures in the old causes torment the
neoliberal. It is not as if they learned from the old failures, but that
they must find some way to make it right. The backwardness of left-wing
politics is akin to the people in a horror movie putting an ancient
cemetery back in its original state so the dead can finally rest.

In fairness, it is not just conventional politics that is backward
looking. Most of the race realists want to go back to the past. They
imagine a world similar to the 1950’s, except everyone knows the
failures of trying to integrate blacks and whites. The harder core
imagine they can go back to the interwar years and be their favorite
uncle. Young Nick Fuentes is one click away from wearing a George
Lincoln Rockwell costume while locking arms with the hip-hop community.

What all of this points to is the sense of dread than hangs over the
American empire as it staggers through its end phase. Everything that it
is, everything that defines the American identity is in the past. The
only conception of the future is one that is somehow a repeat of the
past, real, or imaginary. For a culture that has no future, the present
represents the terrifying final step into the abyss, so the only option
is to turn to the past and find comfort in reliving it.

Perhaps this weird backwardness is an essential step, and it will burn
itself out as the present struggles become too much to ignore. On the
other hand, maybe this is just the price of victory in the Cold War. The
losers had to get on with the business of creating a new future, while
the winners wanted to savor the victory. Our backward politics is the
result of a victory party gone on for too long. Regardless, what comes
next is not the past, but the future, and it will not include any of
these people.
