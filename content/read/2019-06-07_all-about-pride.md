First off, a little housekeeping. I will be doing some server
maintenance this weekend, so there may be some outages. If all goes
well, there will be no outages, but things rarely go well in these
matters, so I plan for the worst. These are things that were left over
from the server move and I just need to get them done. As I transition
into being an e-whore, I need to upgrade the infrastructure in
preparation for new ventures. Since this is the main hub of the empire,
it has to be ready for many spokes.

Speaking of new ventures, I’m thinking it may be time to abandon YouTube
entirely, as I don’t do video and I don’t have a lot of listeners there.
I’d like to say I’m linking arms with my brothers in the struggle during
the Great Purge, but it is really just a matter of convenience. It’s a
bit of a hassle to convert a sound file to the video format and then
upload it to the YouTube site. I wish I had a nickel for every time the
upload failed or YouTube got angry with a music clip. It’s often a pain
to get the show uploaded.

Now that said, it is not some great burden that weighs on me night and
day. I have about a 1000 people using YouTube every week. At least I
think I do. The view counts on YouTube are not right. The other day, I
watched my view count go down in real time, then go back up again a half
hour later. Therefore, I really have no idea who is using it to catch
the show, but if some regulars here prefer it over other formats or have
suggestions for other places to load it, I’m open minded on the subject.

As far as the show this week, someone e-mailed me the story I’m using in
the first segment, which got the theme for the show going. The whole
show is not about Pride Month, but all of it is related. It cannot be
said often enough, nothing says clown world like having a whole month
for our betters to lecture us about how wonderful they are for loving
the gays. It is further proof that we are living in a bizarre secular
theocracy with month long festivals to reinforce the one true faith.
It’s gay Puritanism now.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
