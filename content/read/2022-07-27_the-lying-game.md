At first blush, logic says that deception should have been bred out of
humans long before humans settled down. Deceiving the tribe would be bad
for the deceiver, resulting in exile or even death. That would
significantly lower the reproductive success of the deceiver. On the
other hand, tribes with deceivers would be less cooperative which would
lower their overall success. Given enough time, it seems like deception
should have disappeared from humanity.

Clearly that is not the case. We have lots of liars. That means
deception has some useful role in human society. At the minimum,
deception is not so negative that it would significantly lower the
reproductive success of the deceiver. In fact, deception has probably
always been an asset on the mating market. Even in the narrow world of
the tribe, sweettalking Pebbles into a roll in the cave has obvious
benefits. Perhaps lying for sex is enough to make deception a feature of
man.

On the other hand, every society has prohibitions against deception. In
European cultures, reputation is tied to honesty and trustworthiness.
Someone who gains a reputation for deception loses status. In more
clannish societies, deceiving outsiders is not so bad, especially if it
helps the in-group, but lying to people in the clan can have severe
consequences. Someone who deceives his own people can be exiled from the
group or possibly worse.

This apparent contradiction has been known for a long time. It is not
just humans who display the willingness to deceive others in the group.
In many animal societies, like bees and ants, cooperation is rewarded
and deception is punished. As with humans, deception should have been
selected out a long time ago, but that is clearly not the case which
suggest deception has some value. The deceiver gets enough benefit over
time to make deception useful in some way.

A new
<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.0699"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> suggests that cooperation is
what makes deception possible, as cooperation involved complex rules. An
individual can exploit those rules to gain benefit without having to
contribute. The more cooperative a society, the more opportunities there
are for free riders to game those rules through deception in order to
prosper from the cooperation of others in the group. The less
cooperative a society, the fewer opportunities to exploit the rules
through deception.

Given that we live in an age of universal deceit, at least by those in
positions of authority, the evolution of lying suddenly matters a great
deal. Part of it is that we are better able to see the lying of the
people in charge. Before the mass media age, it was hard for people to
get information on official lies. Of course, it was also much harder to
promote official lies. Mass media results in a sense of mass
cooperation, which means the communications revolution has
revolutionized mass lying.

Even adjusting for our natural recency bias, institutional lying has
exploded over the last thirty years in America. Every day someone from
the government stands in front of cameras and blatantly lies about
things. They know they are lying. The people in the press room know they
are lying. Everyone in the room knows that the people watching it know
everyone involved is lying. There is the sense that the people in these
positions look at lying as a game where the biggest liar wins the day.

This is not a new thing. For twenty years the drug companies have said
that serotonin levels are responsible for depression. It turns out to be
<a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/study-says-depression-not-caused-by-chemical-imbalance-raising-questions-about-antidepressants/ar-AAZQ0uq"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrong</a> and the studies they relied
upon were obviously wrong. In other words, they should have known their
claims were false, but they had a billion reasons to lie, so they lied.
This sort of deception has become the norm. Here is a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> about a prominent cancer
research facility caught faking their research.

Of course, we are still living through one of the greatest hoaxes ever
perpetrated on human society, which is the Covid pandemic. The virus is
real, but the claims around it have been nonsense since the start. Mask
wearing and social distancing never had any basis in science or reason.
Important people not only insisted it was science but forced people to
play along. Now we are learning that the vaccines are not what was
claimed and may have made things worse.

Many people have noticed the scale and degree of lying from official
quarters, but the assumption is always that the cause is degeneracy.
That is the people slithering into positions of authority are
responsible for the rise in deception. The solution is to round them up,
put them on boats and send them out to sea. Put honest people back into
positions of authority and we return to the normal levels of deception.
That may be just as wrong as the things coming from our leaders.

It may be that we have reached a point where the people in the ruling
class of society, this includes the managerial and administrative
classes, no longer feel any connection to the rest of us. They lie and
willingly repeat lies, because it causes no harm to them and solves
immediate concerns. Like people in clannish societies, deceiving
outsiders brings no penalty as outsiders simply do not count. The ruling
class is now an alien clan that is indifferent to the rest of us.

Alternatively, this evolving class awareness may bring with it a sense
that the people over whom they rule are a constant threat. Like the
Alawites in Syria, the new class at the top of the social hierarchy now
sees their position dependent on keeping the masses confused and
disorganized. Israel has always done this with her Arab neighbors,
preventing them from uniting against her. Perhaps the explosion of lying
is due to fear and hostility by the ruling class.

Another possibility, suggested by that British study linked above, is
that deception tracks with cooperation. The more cooperative a society,
or at least the more it appears to cooperate, the more deception in the
society. This seems counter intuitive as cooperation is about trust and
deception undermines trust. On the other hand, the more people
experience deception, the more they are willing to cooperate with those
who display trustworthiness. Trust and deception rise and fall together.

An underappreciated aspect of the communications revolution is how unity
has become the standard of politics. Fifty years ago, people understood
that politics was the art of the possible, which meant compromise. You
give a little to get a little, but often there was no deal to be had and
you just accepted it. Today, politics is all about uniting everyone
behind a narrow cause. Every day our rulers demand we put aside our
interest for something. Mass cooperation is the norm.

These demands for mass cooperation track with the growth of mass media
and they track with the rise in anathematizing of dissent. As
communications have increased, the demand for cooperation have
increased. As cooperation increases, the deception increases with it.
Some of the lying is in an effort to trick people into putting their
interest aside for the good of the cause. Much of the lying is just
opportunism. The greater cooperation has led to an explosion in
deception.

The prisoner’s dilemma
<a href="https://youtu.be/jUTWcYXVR5w" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">game</a> is a classic example of how even simple human
interactions can become quite complex. Rational self-interest can lead
someone into a trap depending upon the rules in which they are forced to
operate. This may be what we are seeing with the explosion of lying. The
communications revolution has altered the ancient rules of human
cooperation within large scale society. The ability to enhance mass
cooperation has resulted in mass deception.

Like that prisoner’s dilemma game, the people doing the lying think they
are acting in their self-interest but they are actually undermining
their collective interests. The more they lie in defense of “our
democracy” the less valuable the system that makes it possible for them
to be a ruling class. Their efforts to enhance the value of their
position in society is undermining their position. Taken to its logical
conclusion, the collapse in trust will bring about a collapse in the
ruling class.
