Politics in a modern democracy is mostly theater. The various actors
hired by the wealthy, put on shows for the people. Today, we have entire
television outlets dedicated to staging these performances. Sometimes
the performances are intended to sway public opinion on an issue.
Sometimes they are intended to distract the public from something
important. The Russian collusion hoax was intended to be a distraction,
so the public would not think about the FBI corruption.

The difference between Hollywood and political theater is a different
measure of the return on investment. Hollywood can make a crappy movie
that goes straight to video, but still make money, as long as the cost
was low.

Space</a> can be a success, even though it is a ridiculously bad movie,
because it was cheap and has become a cult favorite.

Political theater is all about keeping one faction of the public engaged
in the political process, ideally at the expense of another faction. The
Left gives some character on the Right a rough time, so the public is
either exhilarated for their side, the Democrats in this case, or angry
at their side, the Republicans. That’s a success for both teams of
actors, as their handlers get the engagement they seek from the public.
The public is focused on the theater, rather than the laws being passed.

As much as pundits mock the political theater, the people staging these
events are pretty good at their job. Mass media has provided them with
tools to engage even the most disinterested of the public. Fifty years
ago, most people paid little attention to politics or political theater.
A century ago, about 15% of adults bothered to vote in presidential
elections. Today, half of all adults vote in presidential elections and
about 65% of eligible voters turned out in the last presidential
election.

That’s what makes the Mueller hearings a puzzler. Five minutes watching
Mueller made clear that he is an old man who has lost a step. He was
never a brilliant guy to begin with, but he could play his role as the
horse-face Brahman. Today, he has the horse face, but not much else. His
fumbling around with friendly questions from the Democrats was hard to
watch. Anyone who has had to deal with a family member making the long
slow walk into the sunset knows the feeling.

These events are not just a last minute staging. The Democrats have been
working for months to put this show together. Staffers would have spent
weeks preparing questions, preparing Mueller for those questions and
making sure he knew the answers he was expected to give. The point of
these shows is to provide soundbites for state-run media to use in the
following propaganda broadcast. In fact, the cable channels get a heads
up on those soundbites in advance.

Yet none of that happened. Instead, poor old horse face was left to look
like a guy who had wondered off from the home. Instead of clips of him
repeating the scripted catch phrases, it was clips of him fumbling about
looking confused. It would take a heart of stone to not feel some anger
at the people who put that old man through that ridiculous hearing in
front of Congress. Lefty media was so caught off-guard, they were forced
to concede the obvious and call it a debacle.

Now, maybe that was the point. The Russian collusion hoax has become a
problem for the political class, because the people still peddling it
make Mike Cernovich seem like a sober minded skeptic. Maybe this show
was not really for public consumption, so much as a way to embarrass the
people peddling the Russian conspiracy theory and the impeachment
nonsense. If so, they forgot to let the presidential candidates know, as
they were out demanding impeachment the same day.

Just as Hollywood makes expensive flops and Broadway has shows that
close after a month, the political class has their flops too.
McDonald’s, the most successful fast food operation on earth, once tried
selling a burger you had to assemble yourself. The Arch Deluxe is
considered one of the great product flops in history. Hollywood, of
course, has made a lot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biggest_box-office_bombs"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">box-office bombs</a> that lost
tens of millions for the backers. Maybe that’s what we saw with this
hearing. It was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigli" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Gigli</a> of politics.

That said, political disasters tend to have downstream consequences that
you don’t see in the theater or in Hollywood. In the entertainment
realm, they just accept the occasional disaster as a cost of doing
business. In politics, these disasters tend to shift the political
dynamic by discrediting one side. In this case, the Democrats may have
disqualified themselves as reliable critics of Trump, just as Bill
Kristol and the neocons did to themselves back in the 2016 election.

With an election coming up, simply being against Trump more than the
other guy is not going to be a winning strategy. If you look at the
Democrat race thus far, it is has been a contest to see who can be the
most creative at hating white people and who can be the most
enthusiastic in hating orange man. After the Mueller hearing, the field
may be left with just hating white people. Poor old creepy Uncle Joe
could be in for a very rough time of it at the next debate with the
brown horde.

Theater, especially political theater, relies heavily on symbolism. The
sad image of Bob Mueller, a caricature of WASP America, fumbling about
for answers, was a powerful image for the ascendant. They did not see a
failed performance. For them, they saw the door opening for their
opportunity to take the stage. The only thing missing from that show was
a chorus lead by Ocasio-Cortez, singing <a

that regard, the show was not a total bust.
