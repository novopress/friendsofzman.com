t-shirt season, we have a new shirt for **The Occidental Club**, which

The war in Ukraine will go down as one of the stranger conflicts in
American history, mostly because it has been a phony war. That is, the
American government spent most of the war pretending to not be part of
the war, while supplying the Ukrainians with hundreds of billions in war
material. With a new administration bringing realism back to foreign
policy, the end of the war promises to be strange as well. While the end
is known, the path remains a mystery.

The story over the last few weeks has been the squeeze the
administration has put on Zelensky to get him to agree to peace talks
and agree to sign over the country’s natural resources as compensation
for the hundreds of billions in aid. The process has revealed to the
administration that Zelensky is an unreliable partner in a peace deal,
so his future is now limited. You cannot make a deal with a guy that no
one trusts, so whatever peace comes to Ukraine will not include
Zelensky.

You see this with the peace talks coming this week between officials
from the Trump administration and a Ukrainian delegation. Saudi Arabia
is hosting the talks, and one man has been told not to attend. That man
is Zelensky. Not only was he excluded from the meeting, but he was also
barred from traveling with the delegation. Zelensky had planned to just
hang around Saudi Arabia during the talks. Clearly, these meetings are
about life after Zelensky.

The main point of the meeting is to find out if there is any support in
Ukrainian politics for a peace deal. Getting rid of Zelensky is not a
great challenge. Finding a replacement is not a great challenge. The
issue is finding a new leader who can sign a peace deal without the
country collapsing into turmoil. The Trump administration needs to find
someone that can act as an interim leader, get the political factions to
accept a peace deal and then hold elections.

If elections were held today, the most likely winner would be the former
commander of the Ukrainian army, Valery Zaluzhny. While he has the
respect of the army and the respect of the public, he is tightly tied
with the ultranationalists. There are a lot of pictures of Zaluzhny
posing next to iconography reminiscent of a certain period in German
history, because he is extremely fond of that time. That means he is
probably not a reliable option as a peaceful leader of Ukraine.

Another option is Petro Poroshenko, an oligarch who got rich in the
aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. He first got rich in the
candy business, which earned him the nickname of the “Chocolate King.”
He also owned media companies, natural resources firms and manufacturing
concerns. He has lost a lot of his power over the last five years as
Zelensky consolidated his own power in Kiev. Poroshenko is also an
outlandishly corrupt figure with ties to the ultranationalists.

Another option is Yulia Tymoshenko, who made some headlines in the West
when she briefly became the face of the “Orange Revolution.” She is the
leader of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) political party and strongly
anti-Russian, but she has been a critic of the war and Zelensky’s
handling of it. She is an oligarch as well, having got rich in the
energy business. This earned her the nickname “The Gas Princess”, which
may be one of the better nicknamed in politics.

Within Ukrainian media, the betting favorite at the moment is Tymoshenko
for the simple reason that she does not have the ultranationalist
baggage. She has her own party outside the Zelensky machine, and she
seems willing to strike a deal. It may also be easier for a woman to
sell peace to the public. There are millions of wives and mothers of men
who have been killed or maimed in the war. That might be enough to
overcome opposition from the ultranationalists.

A major challenge to finding a replacement for Zelensky is Europe. The
scheming ladies of Brussels view Zelensky as an essential part of their
scheme to turn the EU into a replacement for NATO. This is why they are
offering him unconditional support for his efforts to scuttle any peace
deal with Russia. Then you have individual leaders like Keir Starmer and
Emmanuel Macron, who are trying hard to make Zelensky seem like the most
honest man in Europe.

Further complicating matters is the condition of the Ukraine army. They
are now being routed in the Kursk region. Thousands of their best
soldiers are now trapped in a cauldron with no chance of escape.
Thousands of others have surrendered and thousands more have died
fleeing toward the border. An army low on morale, hearing that its main
benefactor wants a peace deal, is not going to respond well to news that
its best units have been routed.

Since everything about this proxy war has been strange, it is fitting
that its last acts will be strange as well. Normally in a long war of
attrition, the side with the upper hand is willing to press on with the
war, while the other side wants peace. In this case, the winning side
wants a deal, while the losing side demands to fight on, even as its
main benefactor demands peace. It will be another reminder that this
part of the world produces nothing but misery for everyone around it.
