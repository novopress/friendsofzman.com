Sheila Jackson Lee is not retarded or missing a chromosome. She is just
not terribly bright. The reason she is in Congress, however, is the
voters of her district are mostly to the left of her on the bell curve.
<a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>,
her district is 40% black, 35% Hispanic and 20% white. <a
href="http://www.biggestuscities.com/demographics/tx/18th-congressional-district"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to this site</a>,
her district is one of the youngest. It ranks 18th in number of children
under 5 and 30th in residents under 30. It seems odd that it would have
so many babies, yet a declining population of adults. Hmmmm….

The answer is it is home to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Ward,_Houston#Crime"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Third Ward</a>, a section of
downtown Houston. The Third Ward is known as one of the most dangerous
neighborhoods on the planet. <a
href="http://www.chron.com/business/real-estate/article/Two-Houston-neighborhoods-called-most-dangerous-4476367.php"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to this</a>, you
have a 1-in-13 chance of being a crime victim there. Getting a decent
murder rate for the area is tough, but news reports claim a murder rate
three times the rest of the city, which is 12 so that means over 30. It
is hard to know for sure, but we know enough to say it is a
hyper-violent place.

The general picture to keep in mind is of a poor urban ghetto filled
with violent drug dealers and their underclass partners. You’re not
getting a lot of high IQ strivers coming from that district. The median
IQ of her district is below 85. It is the old line about the one eyed
man being king of the blind. Jackson Lee is a moron by normal standards,
but in her district, she’s the
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smart fraction</a>. In
Detroit, a smart fraction with IQ’s in the 90’s resulted in the
Haiti-fication of what was once America’s richest city.

 

It is easy to pick on Lee and the people of her district, but it is the
central defect of democracy. No matter how much you spend on education,
half of the population is going to be below average. More than half,
much more than half in fact, is average or below average in
intelligence. The magical thinking of democracy is that one dumb person
cannot be trusted to make decisions. A million dumb people will
collectively act like a single smart person. The whole is greater than
the sum of the parts.

The people of Lee’s district should not be voting on anything of
significance. They are simply too dumb to be trusted. Some could be
trusted with the vote. Certainly some own property, run a business and
conduct themselves as responsible citizens. Most struggle to keep up
with the basics of living. A fair number are unable to understand much
more than a child. Why would anyone think it wise to let such people
vote? Yet, this is the logic of democracy. It is an appeal to the lowest
common denominator.
