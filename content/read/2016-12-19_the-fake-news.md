There’s not much new under the sun. Governments have been putting out
propaganda to fool the public since the first guy figured out he could
order some other guys to stack one rock on another. The trick is for the
people in charge to appear to believe their own bravo sierra, but not
actually believe it. If a ruler begins to think he is actually a god,
for example, he is going to start making terrible errors. He needs the
people to think he is a god, but he has to know he is a man
and vulnerable to all the same defects as any other man.

Put another way, rulers must never get high off their own supply. A good
example of this is the agit-prop about the Russians hacking the
election. Polling shows that close to 60% of the public thinks the
“Russians hacked us” stories are ridiculous. About 20% seem to think it
happened and matters. That 20% is most assuredly the back benchers from
the Cult of Modern Liberalism. That would not be a big deal, except the
news media and the White House, at least for a few more weeks, are run
by these people.

The result is the Obama White House is getting pressure from their
toadies in the press to do something about <a

The options are risky because the White House knows the hacking story
was made up to pacify the lunatics. They also know the Russians know it
was made up. Creating a diplomatic crisis over something both sides know
is a fiction – and a ridiculous one at that – is very dangerous. The
Russians will assume there must be some other reason for the move. Once
countries are left to guess about motives, things can spiral out of
control quickly. Thus the White House has to just make a show of it, but
not actually do anything.

The “Russians hacked us” stuff does show how the Left is expert at
narrative management. They can easily retrofit the past, even the very
recent past, into the official story line. If necessary, they will
rewrite the narrative on the fly. You see that in this section of the
linked story.

Obama did nothing of the sort. It was the Israelis who sabotaged the
Iranian reactors with malicious code. In fact, the US intelligence
community was as baffled as everyone else about how the Israelis pulled
off one of the great cyberwarfare capers of all time. But, that does not
serve the narrative so the past will now be restated. The new past is
Obama opened a desk drawer and pulled out a “cyber weapon” to deploy
against the Iranians, like the Bond villain often does when he thinks he
finally has Bond trapped.

Of course, the bigger problem here is that running endless fake news
stories erodes public trust in the media and their government
supervisors. Fifty years ago, people could suspect something was
bullshit, but proving it was often impossible. Today, there is too much
information and too many ways to disseminate it. This stuff is quickly
exposed and the public becomes more skeptical, as well as better able to
spot the lie. That’s why only nut jobs believe the Russian hacking
stuff.

Russian hackers are real. So are Ukrainian hackers and Chinese hackers
and Nigerian princess looking for your bank account number. The great
threat to network security, however, is not a secret team of super
villains writing malicious code. The broken window is the old guy, who
is uncomfortable with technology, using “pass123” as his password. John
Podesta was not hacked. He had a childishly simple password and he left
it lying around for people to see.

According to research, 4% of people use “123456” as their password.
Cracking that is not hacking. It is guessing. According to the
revelations in WikiLeaks, the people working for Team Clinton at State
shared passwords with one another. That means one person leaving the
door open exposes everyone, which is what happened in every conceivable
way. The reason all of this private information ended up in the public
during the campaign is the people producing it are morons and should
never be trusted to keep secrets.

That’s ultimately the real news behind the fake news. A skeptical public
was presented evidence that confirmed their skepticism. The attempts to
retroactively discredit these revelations is only reinforcing the
general sense that the mainstream media cannot be trusted. Trust in
major media is at all time lows and their audience is dissipating as
people seek out alternatives. There’s nothing mysterious about it. As
the gatekeepers lose control of the gates, the public learns the truth
about what lies beyond the gates.
