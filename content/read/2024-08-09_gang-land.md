Perhaps it is just a normal part of reaching geezerhood, but I am often
surprised at how much has changed in my lifetime. I have often said that
the past is a foreign country, but it does not seem like it was that
long ago when it was normal. You see this with the things that used to
be called vices. Gambling, pornography, drugs, and prostitution used to
be things to avoid, but now they are celebrated lifestyles.

This came to mind while viewing a clip from one of the gangster shows
where the principals were discussing their revenue streams. Just about
every way the old gangsters made money has now been taken over by the
state or by corporations, who are friends of the state. To a great
degree, the decline of the mafia is due to them being muscled out by the
government and its corporate pals.

That is the show this week. As a break from politics, I thought it would
be fun to run through the various ways the old mobsters earned money and
see who controls those rackets in this age. The only racket that is not
run by government or corporations is prostitution, but that is
debatable. Things like OnlyFans are a very small step removed from
prostitution. How long before they take the next step?
