**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-partys-over/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up and related to this
post. All of a sudden, macroeconomics is becoming an important topic
again. The Sunday
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/572954" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">podcast</a> is also up behind the green door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The technical definition of money is “something generally accepted as a
medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment.” For most
people this has always meant the legal tender of their homeland. Until
fairly recent, this was a coin with the face of the king on it. The
better the reputation of the king, the more valuable his coin, because
traders were more likely to accept it. A good king made sure his coins
had a consistent amount of gold or silver in it.

The reason for that is precious metals like gold and silver were always
the world’s reserve currency. Everyone in the world would accept gold
and silver for payment, even in places that restricted the use of the
metals. You could always take the metal to the king’s mint and exchange
it for his coins. Granted, he took a fee for himself and you were
charged the cost of minting the coins, but that was predictable. In the
end, all currency was measured in gold and silver.

We no longer use gold coin for money. Every country in the world uses
what the economist call fiat currency. This is a government-issued
currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or
silver. Instead, it is backed by the “full faith and credit” of the
issuing government. Money is now an expression of the government power
behind it. The US dollar is the reserve currency of the world largely
due to the fact the American government was the most trusted.

Hard money enthusiasts assume this means the United States can  print as
much money as it needs, but this is not exactly true. The international
monetary system that evolved after the collapse of the Bretton Woods
system in the 1970’s is a framework that controls the exchange rate of
the major currencies. Every major currency is based on the dollar, just
as oil and gas are priced in dollars. The petrodollar was created in the
1970’s when the Bretton Woods system collapsed.

What the current system does, in effect, is link currencies to the
supply of crude oil through the dollar. How much oil you can buy with
your home currency is dependent upon how many dollars you can buy with
it. It is not a direct link, as oil production rises and falls and the
supply of dollars rises and falls, relative to other major currencies
like the Euro or Chinese Yuan. In effect, America controls the world by
controlling the price of commodities like crude oil and natural gas.

In the old days, minting coins was a profit center for the king. A
strong king would restrict the use of other coins in his domain. His
people had to take their foreign coins, gold and silver to his mint for
conversion to his coin. In addition to the cost of production, he tacked
on a profit for himself. This is called seigniorage and it works the
same for fiat money as it does hard money. This profit from controlling
the global currency is one way the United States has grown so rich.

One of the consequences of this system is the world has an insatiable
appetite for US government debt. Because it is denominated in dollars
and considered the safest of financial bets, it makes the ideal
collateral. This has allowed the United States and other Western
countries to run massive trade and spending deficits. The world wants
the debt and the world wants to sell the West their products. US debt
was 30% of GDP in 1980 and now it is 127% of GDP.

This is the subtext of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Russia and China,
especially China, are tired of this arrangement. They correctly see it
as to the advantage of Washington at their expense. This is why China is
backing Russia’s play to demand rubles for its energy and agricultural
products. This would pave the way for China demanding yuan for its
products and the right to pay for energy in yuan. India is also quietly
supporting what the Russians are doing for the same reasons.

This is why Washington is in no mood to strike a deal over Ukraine. It
is not the only reason, but it is a big part of the plan to protect the
dollar. If Washington can break the Putin government through financial
war, China and India will drop their plans to buck the dollar in the
global economy. A century after the Great War, the new global war is
being mainly fought in finance. The West, led by America, is now at war
with the world over control of the global currency system.

It is probably a war that the West cannot win. The reason is the same
reason the king would put his face on his coins. Money is the physical
expression of power. The strong king could enforce his monetary policy
in his domain and his money had a predictable amount of gold and silver.
In effect, his money was the representation of his people and the
cultural that defined them. The legal tender of a country is the measure
of that country’s wealth and power relative to the world.

The West no longer makes or invents anything useful. The power of the
West is the legacy power to control the financial system. It is a system
arranged by Mercurian people in order to control the Apollonians. The
former are the people who operate as middlemen and service providers,
while the latter are the people who grow the food, make the goods and
keep the gears properly lubricated. The former operates in the West,
while the latter exist outside the West.

Reality is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing in it
and reality says that growing and making things counts for more than
thinking of things. The reason Washington has not crushed the Russian
economy is the world needs the stuff Russia pulls pout of the earth. In
this economic war of attrition, Russian can feed itself and keep its
homes warm, while Europe will have to hope America can provide the food
and energy at a reasonable fee.

The most likely outcome of this global conflict is something people have
suspected for quite some time. The global currency will become a basket
of commodities like natural gas and crude oil. Maybe agricultural
products will be in the mix. The reason for this is the world runs on
energy and food. Bretton Woods III, as some are calling it, will be a
new set of currency arrangements whereby money is based on its
purchasing power for the agreed upon basket of products.

What this means in the short run is that the West is about to get poorer
as governments are forced to cut spending and debase the currency to get
out from under domestic debt obligations like pension payments. It also
means the end of globalism as has been defined by Washington for three
decades. Trade will continue, but between countries rather than
independent global enterprises. Thirty years after the Cold War the
world is about to start healing and return to something close to normal.
