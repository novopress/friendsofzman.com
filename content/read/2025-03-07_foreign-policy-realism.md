One of the interesting things about the shift in foreign policy
initiated by the Trump administration is that it is a break from what
has been policy for a century. This sudden lurch into realism is a
departure from Wilsonian democracy. Trump wants to center policy on the
material interests of the country. Up until now, policy was centered
around moral claims about how the world ought to be ordered.

Through the Cold War it was assumed that pragmatism was the rule because
of the threat of nuclear annihilation. The better way to view it is that
Wilsonian democracy was on a leash for forty years. Once the Cold War
ended, it was like a hyperactive dog that got under the fence. The last
thirty years has been an explosion of Wilsonian democracy playing
catchup for lost time.

Even during the Cold War, American policy makers and politicians had a
fondness for moralizing about the world. There were endless debates over
the morality of dealing with dictators who happened to be anti-Soviet.
This was finally resolved in the 1980’s with the distinction between
authoritarian and totalitarian. The former was a temporary compromise,
while the later was a forever enemy.

Once totalitarianism ended, then it was a race to go around the world
addressing the temporary tolerance for governments not up to American
standards. Now it seems this has run out of road and necessity is once
again forcing a return of realism in the foreign policy realm. That is
the show this week. It is a general primer on realism versus the
idealism that is now being abandoned.
