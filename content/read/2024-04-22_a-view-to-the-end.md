<span style="color: #ff0000;">**Correction:**</span> Last week in this
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=31873" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> I linked to something at Claremont and said
they are financially backing the IM1776 project. I am told by the people
at IM1776 that this is not the case and their operation is funded only
by subscriptions. Claremont is merely helping them navigate the process
of IRS approval as a non-profit. I apologize for the error and will have
the researchers flogged.

Since the failure of the Ukrainian offensive last summer, the question
that remains unanswered is how does the war in Ukraine end? All wars end
eventually, with most ending in a negotiated settlement. If the
Ukrainians armed with everything NATO can supply are unable to push back
the Russians, then their most logical next step is to find a solution at
the negotiating table. The West should also be looking for a way out of
what has become a quagmire for them.

To date, Ukraine has showed no signs of understanding their position in
the war, instead demanding more weapons and the unconditional surrender
of Russia. The West has also ruled out a negotiated settlement. Europe
is still talking about finding new weapons to send to Ukraine and
Washington just secured a new aid package. Ukraine has also passed a new
mobilization bill with the aim of press-ganging what amounts to a new
army while not demobilizing existing forces.

That is the first clue as to where things are heading. Various Ukrainian
sources have made statements about the current state of the army.
Military sources say the army is forty percent short of men. They need
100,000 new soldiers to fill the front lines and another 150,000 for
reserves. Do a little math and that means they need an army of 625,000
to match the Russians and currently have 375,000. In other words, they
are currently outnumbered by at least two-to-one.

The first thing to note here is that the Ukrainian government, Zelensky
himself, has claimed to have mobilized one million men. This is explains
this Washington Post <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/04/ukraine-mobilization-zelensky-russia/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> last month focusing on the
700,000 missing men. This works out to be about thirty thousand men per
month, which lines up with Russian figures on the Ukrainian losses, both
killed and severely wounded. It also explains why Western intelligence
sources have said Ukraine could collapse this summer.

This would also explain the fanaticism with which the regime pushed to
get the Ukraine spending package through Congress. The administration is
now haunted by a much larger version of the Afghanistan debacle
unfolding in Europe. Imagine millions of Ukrainian refugees flooding
into Europe right around when Trump is doing a presidential debate from
prison. The hope is that an influx of aid will hold off the inevitable
for long enough to drag Biden’s carcass across the finish line.

The spending package itself is the typical boondoggle. Most of the money
is going to friends of government to help them further rob the
middle-class. Another ten billion will go to Ukraine to pay salaries and
pensions. Much of it will be stolen. Another fifteen billion could pay
for weapons, but the warehouses are empty, and the West lacks the things
Ukraine needs. There are no air defense systems or artillery tubes
sitting around waiting to be sent to Ukraine.

There is a bigger problem with sending aid to Ukraine. it appears the
political situation inside the Ukraine military is becoming unstable.
The Azov battalion, for example, has become increasingly insubordinate.
An ultranationalist brigade made up of Right Sector volunteers had to be
disbanded due to insubordination. Some elite units have chosen to
surrender rather than fight. These are all signs of an army that is
exhausted from two years of fighting a war of attrition.

Another clue as to where things are heading emerged recently when the
Russian U.N. representative, Vasily Nebenzya, <a
href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-at-a-un-security-council-meeting-called-by-russia-on-threats-to-international-peace-and-security-7/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">warned</a> the West that not only would
further military aid to Ukraine make no difference, but it would mean
“the only peace discussion it would have was of Ukraine’s unconditional
surrender.” Additionally, members of the Putin government have now made
it clear that there will be no negotiations with Zelensky or Ukraine as
long as Zelensky is president.

Up to this point, the Russians have been careful to keep the door open
to sitting down with the Ukrainians to hammer out a deal. Their position
in 2023 was that they would like to return to the deal worked out in
Istanbul in 2022. That changed this winter to that deal being the
starting point of a new potential deal. Now it is clear that there is no
interest in dealing with Zelensky at all and that soon the Russians will
abandon the idea of a negotiated settlement entirely.

These three data points now frame what can happen next. Washington is
not interested in any deal with the Russians. The Russians have
concluded they cannot deal directly with the Ukrainians and there may be
no deal with the West. The rapidly deteriorating condition of the
Ukrainian military means it will break in the next year but could also
collapse at any time. In other words, the war is now a game of chicken
in which the West just assumes the Russians will blink.

What this suggests is that inside Washington has evolved an absolutist
point of view in which the only tolerable outcome is the absolute
position. In the case of the Ukraine war, the only acceptable outcome is
the total submission of Russia. All other scenarios are ruled out as
intolerable. We saw this with the Ukraine spending bill. There was no
room for negotiations. Attempts to negotiate resulted in greater demands
until the Republicans folded and submitted to everything.

In other words, even as conditions in Ukraine deteriorate, it is
unlikely the West will seek out a deal with the Russians. Instead, they
will seek ways to drag out the inevitable, operating on the assumption
that the Russians will eventually blink. This is an irrational position,
as the Russians have no reason to change course. If anything, they have
new motivations to find additional pressure points on the West. Based on
recent statements, the Russians seem to understand this.

This may be a foreshadowing for what lies ahead for the West. The
adoption of an absolutist position is a sign of fear. Instead of
adapting to changing conditions, the leadership is becoming paranoid and
delusional. There is a Hitler in the bunker vibe to what we are seeing
in Washington. That means the end game in Ukraine may be a clue as to
how things unfold for the American empire across a range of things. The
end game of the empire is coming into focus.
