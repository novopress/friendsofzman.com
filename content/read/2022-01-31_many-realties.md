**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-covid-matrix/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. After sending it off
I thought about the idea of world building, so I addressed than a bit
today. The
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/521946" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday podcast</a> is up behind the green door and it is
mostly about the usual stuff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The old paleo-conservative gag about the demand for Nazis exceeding the
available supply has become something of an iron law of the universe.
Each generation discovers that the American Left is obsessed with
fascists, white supremacists, the Klan and so on, despite these things
no longer being real. Other than some cartoonish play-acting by those
desperate for attention, these things are no longer real. They certainly
play no role in politics or the general culture.

The lack of supply, however, has been no deterrence, especially now that
the internet allows people to create these reality from thin air. The
intensively on-line far-left invests all of its time finding someone
they can label as the bogeyman or one the many members of the bogeyman
army. The Antifa subculture, for example, is organized around the hunt
for fascists and white supremacists. They spend all day looking for new
baddies and obsessing over the prior baddies.

This being America, this means there is a subgenre of fringe-left media
that caters to this subculture with <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-hungary-anti-semitic-george-soros-conspiracy-viktor-orban_n_61f5e11ae4b04f9a12be3a76?wrf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">ghost stories</a> about Nazis. Hoffer
said that all mass movements in America become a corporation, a racket
or a business. The world of on-line hate-hunters is a racket that
supplies world building materials to the intensively on-line Left so
they can maintain their fantasy space. The witch hunters need witches,
so there are people supplying them with witches.

This obsession with imaginary fascists is written off as the work of the
mentally unstable, which is true, but it is more than that. What these
people are doing is world-building within the alternative reality of
their own creation. They live in a reality that says they are the
guardians of the future utopia, keeping the world safe from its enemies,
which come in many styles and guises. In order to keep this fantasy
going, they have to find characters that fit the role of the villain.

In a way, this subculture has become something like the massive on-line
role playing games that sprang up a dozen years ago. People can join,
but they have to assume a character and then join a band on-line. This
band is a set of social media accounts that support one another in their
imaginary struggle. Doxing is both a weapon and a world building tool.
The revelation of someone in league with the Dark One helps perpetuate
the fantasy by supplying social proof to the members.

This is why these people look so outlandishly weird when they turn up in
public to riot with other fantasy groups or hold what amounts to a
street convention. They take their on-line character out into the real
world, but the real world does not have these sorts of people or the
bogeymen they are chasing. Antifa, BLM, furries, cosplayers, the
alt-right and so on are normal in the alternative reality of their
subculture, because the rules of that subculture have been created to
normalize this stuff.

That is how to view the now defunct alt-right. Like the intensely
on-line far-left, the alt-right formed up on-line as a form of escapism.
They quickly became a foil for the intensely on-line far-left, because
the interaction with that subculture shaped them into the much needed
opponent. The intensely on-line libertarians became intensely on-line
fascists because that gave them an enemy, the intensely on-line
antifascists, who were happy to have the new villain in their version of
reality.

It is not just the intensely on-line far-left that lives in an
alternative reality. The anti-Trump movement quickly evolved into an
alternative reality. Of course, its was the existing alternative
realties of neoconservatives, the intensely on-line far-left and others
that coalesced around this new boss introduced to the game. Trump
allowed these alternative realties to align against a commonly imagined
enemy. It is why they cannot stop talking about him, even after he has
been defeated.

Eric Hoffer famously said that mass movements can survive without a god
but they must always have a devil. This seems to be true of these
alternative realities that are shaping the reality of the modern age.
The inherent conflict with reality is masked by the obsession with
imaginary adversaries. This has now become a form of world building
where the players invest their time inventing new bosses to fight,
always based on the general archetype required of their alternative
reality.

While this phenomenon is mostly a product of the internet, it is jumping
from the virtual into the physical world. The ridiculous Spotify <a
href="https://www.showbiz411.com/2022/01/30/spotifys-daniel-ek-panics-over-rock-star-defections-personally-there-are-plenty-of-individuals-and-views-on-spotify-that-i-disagree-with-strongly"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> is a good example. The people
running this company are responding to a fictional controversy, when
they could easily ignore it. This is because many of the people who work
at the firm are also deep into one of these alternative realities where
Joe Rogan is the devil. In other words, the alterative realty is
spilling into the reality of the CEO.

Of course, the people occupying the C-suites at these companies are not
exactly living in reality either. Theirs is a world that is as alien to
the daily reality of normal people as the reality of the intensely
on-line far-left. In their world, the gesture counts for more than an
action. If the Spotify CEO were to tell these loons to bleep-off, that
would be viewed as a bad gesture in his reality. It would suggest he is
not sensitive to their perspectives and in that reality, insensitivity
is a mortal sin.

Much like the intensely on-line far-left, our ruling class is now
increasingly occupied with world building in order to make their reality
more realistic. The Covid panic is a great example, where a whole
industry grew up to feed materials to the world builders of this fantasy
game of pandemic. A bizarre aspect of the mass media age is that the
ruling class now has an unquenchable thirst for crises. In the absence
of real problems, they busy themselves creating them.

Of course, there are real problems, but those problems are boring. Like
the kid who has played the game so many times he no longer finds it
interesting, the ruling elite no longer has an interest in fixing roads
or addressing the issues of society. As Pete Buttigieg made <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/591595-buttigieg-targeting-rising-traffic-fatalities"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">clear</a> the other day, fixing potholes
is boring. Instead, he will focus on make traffic fatalities more
equitable. This new quest will allow him to have much more fun and feel
much more important.

Diverging realities is not exactly new. The French Revolution featured
at least two alternative realities. There was the reality of the Old
Regime that had lost contact with reality in the late middle-ages. Then
there was the new reality of the radicals, forming up in salons and
public houses. When the reality of the Old Regime was no longer
sustainable in the face of reality, it collapsed. Into the void rushed
the new false reality of the Jacobins, which soon foundered on reality.

What is unique about this age is both the novelty of these alternative
realities and the proliferation of them on-line. America is becoming a
balkanized collection of alternative realties increasingly disconnected
from actual reality. The tech giants are now promising to strap VR
goggles on every face, which will only accelerate this phenomenon.
Instead of people taking soma and living in a dream state, the drug of
this brave new world will be the virtual reality and the world building
it requires.
