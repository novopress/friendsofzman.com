Being wrong is as natural as standing upright. All of us make mistakes,
miss the obvious and make predictions that, in retrospect,
were hilariously stupid. I predicted that the neocons, despite their
rhetoric, were going to find a Pinochet to install in Baghdad after they
ousted Saddam. After all, no one could be so dumb as to think that
Western self-government would work in the Arab world. I think a lot of
people on the Right look back at the Bush years and wonder how so many
could be so wrong about the neocons.

Error is supposed to result in reflection and reconsideration. The only
way to learn from a mistake is to actually learn something from it. The
take away from the Bush years, for me at least, was that the Buckley
Conservatives are yesterday men untethered from reality, so it’s time to
go another way. Many reading this learned from the Obama years that
democracy is a suicide pact with the dumbest people in your
neighborhood. The solutions lie outside the political process. <a

in the Trump years</a>.

One of the remarkable aspects of the managerial class is they don’t seem
to learn much from their errors. The neocons are still claiming that
elections will somehow turn the Arab world into a membership meeting
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonie_Club"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Harmonie Club</a>. After
every Muslim atrocity committed in a Western city, the Progressives tell
us the solution is more Muslims. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Now we have Puerto Rico</a>,
which should be the example that puts some reality back into public
policy debates, but that will never happen.

Puerto Rico has been a US territory since the Treaty of Paris ended the
Spanish-American War. It probably would have been setup as an
independent country, but the US Navy thought it was useful and the sugar
growers liked being a US territory. Even though it no longer has any
value to the Navy and they no longer grow much sugar, Puerto Rico
remains a territory. It does have a strong manufacturing base, mostly
due its status as a tax haven, but also as the result of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bootstrap"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">US policy to encourage
industry</a> on the island.

It was not too long ago that the Official Right was championing Puerto
Rico as an example of how fixing the institutions, reforming the
economic polices, could fix even the most backward society. It was an
obvious ploy to peddle open borders to their voters. After all, if
Republicanism could work on the PR’s, it would work on those Mexicans
imported into your town. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s an old Cal Thomas
article </a>talking about the wonderfulness of the Republican governor
of the island at the time. I love this quote.

> What would he recommend to change the tone?

> “First, show up; show respect. Most Republican candidates don’t do

> issues of greatest concern in the Hispanic community. They are no
> different from other communities most of the time. On immigration,
> Republicans say, ‘we want legal immigration and we are the country,

In case you’re wondering,
<a href="http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-Luis_Fortuno.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luis Fortuna</a>, the subject
of that column, now lives in DC at the insider law firm Steptoe &
Johnson. The reason for that is those “naturally conservative” Hispanics
voted him out of office. Despite all that, Puerto Rico is still Puerto
Rico. It has a crime rate higher than every US state, something close to
Baltimore. It also has a corruption rate triple the typical US state. In
other words, despite the best efforts of the US, Puerto Rico is the
product of the people who populate the island.

Now that the island is going bankrupt, it would make sense for the
conservative cheerleaders to take stock and maybe reconsider those
wonderful economic policies they were sure would fix anything.
Similarly, libertarians, who are sure that tinkering with the tax code
can fix everything, might want to take a look at Puerto Rico. Of course,
that will never happen. Being a public intellectual in the modern era
means never having to say you’re sorry for being wrong. Heck, you don’t
even have to admit to being wrong.

Our rulers should also reconsider the wisdom of importing tens of
millions of Hispanics into America. After all, California turned itself
into Puerto Rico demographically and is now on its way to transforming
itself into Puerto Rico financially. The underlying premise of open
borders is that people are the same everywhere. It is the dirt that
makes them into law-abiding, prudent Americans. We have spent a century
pouring magic into our Caribbean colony and it is no better than the
Dominican Republic.

The island has a per capita debt of $25,000 and per capita GDP of
$28,000. Throw in the $16,000 in per capita pension liabilities and you
have, well, California. The two biggest financial basket cases in
America are also the two greatest examples of the prevailing ruling
class orthodoxy. The fact that both are looking a lot like bust outs is
probably not a coincidence. You would think some of the people in the
political class would take note, but no one will learn anything from the
Puerto Rican bankruptcy. They never learn.
