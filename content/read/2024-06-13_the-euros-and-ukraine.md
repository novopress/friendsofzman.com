During Covid, one of the questions that kicked around was how would the
public react when they found out the government was lying? The answer is
we do not know as the whole thing has been thrown down the memory hole
for the most part. The truth about Covid has slowly seeped into the
public consciousness, but no one asks them about it and no media outlet
discusses it. The best anyone can tell is that the Covid lies have
become a part of the general cynicism.

We will soon get another case to see how the public will respond when
the truth is nothing like what they have been told by the media. In the
case of Project Ukraine, this test will happen in Europe where the local
media talks about the war in Ukraine in terms that have always been
fanciful. It was European media that gave us the “Ghost of Kiev” and the
babushkas knocking down fighter jets with canned goods. They continue to
feed their public outlandish stories about the war.

Those with an interest in the war and access to the internet can find
out what is actually happening on the battlefield. The facts are often
blurred by the fog of war and the bias of the people doing the
reporting, but with some patience you can get a good picture of what is
happening in Ukraine. It is even possible to get a sense of what is
happening outside the war zone as there are still plenty of Ukrainians
posting stuff to popular apps like Telegram and Instagram.

Very little of this reality gets into Europeans media. Instead, they
produce content like
[this](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/12/kyivs-wonder-weapons-are-decimating-the-russian-army/)
from the UK Telegraph, which is supposed to be a serious media platform,
not the typical British tabloid. Not only are they “reporting” that
Ukrainian “wonder weapons are decimating the Russians”, but they also
have a <a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/ukraine-weapons-tanks-jets-missiles-military-equipment-war-russia/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">special section</a> with high production
quality explanations of those wonder weapons. In other words, this is a
highly choregraphed bit of propaganda designed to deceive the public.

The wonder weapon stuff is mild compared to some of the other posts you
will find about Ukraine in the Telegraph. This <a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/11/putin-russia-crimea-kerch-land-bridge-supply-route-logistic/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a> claims the Ukrainians are about
to seize Crimea because their squadrons of unicorns are showering the
place with magical fairy dust they shoot from their ass. That is not an
exaggeration, as magical farting unicorns would be more plausible than
the contents of the actual post. The whole thing is a fantasy with no
basis in reality.

It is not just the UK media that is gaslighting the public. The German
media is full of similarly nonsensical stories. Here is the <a
href="https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/ukraine-krieg-die-aktuelle-lage-im-live-ticker-83726300.bild.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine page</a> for Bild, which you can
use Google to translate into English. Die Zeit is probably the most
respected news site in Germany, and it just <a
href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/karte-ukraine-krieg-russland-frontverlauf-truppenbewegungen"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">copies and pastes</a> whatever Kiev, or
the neocons send them about what is happening in the war. While not as
ridiculous as the UK media, the continental media is gaslighting its
public just as hard.

The problem is the war is going horribly for Ukraine. The Russian army
is slowly and methodically grinding the Ukraine army into bits. Every
month the Ukrainians are forced to fall back at some point along the
line of contact. The Russians have knocked out the power grid of the
country, which means there is no electric for up to twenty hours per day
in some areas. The Ukrainian army is literally snatching men off the
streets and sending them to the front due to a lack of manpower.

What Ukraine war watchers have known for a long time is that at some
point, the Ukraine army will not be able to keep fighting. At some
point, the Russians will decide it is time to end the war on its terms.
Given that this is a proxy war between Washington and Moscow, the
assumption is the fall is when things come to a head, just in time for
the presidential election. Maybe it will happen sooner or maybe later,
but at some point, reality will burst through those European headlines.

From a distance, it is hard to know if the firehose of nonsense about
the war is fooling the European public. The recent elections suggest
that at the minimum the public is tired of the ruling parties putting
the welfare of Ukraine ahead of the welfare of the European people. It
is possible that the Euros have been wise to the media nonsense about
Ukraine, but simply care more about other things. Like Covid, it is hard
to know as no one bothers to find out what the public thinks.

Unlike Covid, the collapse of Project Ukraine is not going to be easy to
sweep under the rug by ignoring it. With Covid, the liars scurried off
with their bags of cash and the pols declared victory as they let their
foot off the neck of the public. The general public was simply happy to
get back to normal. That is probably not going to work with Ukraine as
there is no benefit to putting the topic in the past. There will simply
be what the media claimed to be true and the truth, which is the
opposite.

Compounding the problem in Europe is the fact that the leading
politicians have made Ukraine their signature issue. In the U.S., the
pols have been giving it a good leaving alone for a year now, other than
the big funding push in February. Note that as soon as that bill passed,
they changed the subject. In Europe, the political class has made
Ukraine a test of their legitimacy. Therefore, when the Ukraine army
surrenders, they cannot shrug and move on to other issues.

One of the lessons of the Soviet era was that the accumulation of lies
eventually saps even the most repressive regime of legitimacy. The
Soviet system fell apart when no one could think of a reason to support
it, not even the people at the top of the system who benefitted from it
the most. In this way, Ukraine and Covid may be analogous to Afghanistan
and Chernobyl. These are events that delegitimize the system by making
clear that nothing it says or does is on the level.
