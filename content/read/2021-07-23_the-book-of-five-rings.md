Clausewitz famously drew the parallel between war and politics when he
said, “War is the continuation of politics by other means.” Therefore,
is makes sense for those engaged in politics to study the tactics of war
and the warrior. It is not an accident that many of the great political
figures in our history were also military men. Twelve U.S. presidents
were generals. For a country founded on the principle of civilian rule,
having a quarter of the executives come from the military is telling.

The Book of Five Rings is a book on martial arts written by a legendary
Japanese swordsman named Miyamoto Musashi. He was also a philosopher,
strategist and luckily for us, a writer. He became famous in 17th
century Japan for his unique fighting style and his undefeated record in
his 61 duels. He is known to westerners through his book on strategy,
but in Japan he is still remembered for his great deeds. There is a
shrine named after him, which is supposed to be his burial site.

Back in my youth when I lived in another country also called America,
this book was popular among conservatives. Japan Inc. was clobbering
American industry and it was claimed that it was due to their superior
business strategies. This book was popular with Japanese businessmen, so
it became popular with American businessmen who wanted to pretend to be
learned strategists. Business tycoons like to imagine themselves as
warriors, so it made perfect sense.

This week the show is about this book and the lessons that are contained
in it which may apply to our age. Conveniently, it is broken into five
sections, so there is a ten minute segment on each of the books that
make up the whole book. It is a very short book in total that could
easily be classified as a pamphlet. Musashi was not the sort for beating
around the bush in his writing. The last book is just one page, a total
of 311 words not counting the title and the salutation.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
