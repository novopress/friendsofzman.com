False consciousness is term probably coined by Friedrich Engels to
describe a scenario where a subordinate class embraces the ideology of
the ruling class, even though the ideology guarantees their
subordination. In the communist view of things, workers embraced the
bourgeois values of capitalist society, even though it meant they
remained at the bottom of the social hierarchy. It was an interesting
bit of projection that has been a feature of radicalism since the
beginning.

To be a radical in the conventional sense of Western politics starts
with a heavy dose of self-deception. Radicals are rarely from the
subordinate class. Almost always they are from the ruling elite. They
are intellectuals raised in leisure, but convinced they are the
authentic voice of the masses. The rare few from the masses have been
elevated because they confirm the bourgeois radical’s need for
affirmation. As a reward, the striver gets to live in the farmhouse with
the pigs.

A glaring example of radical self-delusion is in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NusQH0pnX7Y" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this clip</a> from the Jimmy Dore Show in which the host
discusses the revolution with Chris Hedges. For those unfamiliar, Dore
is a comic who has made himself rich doing left-wing comedy. Chris
Hedges is an activist who caters to the NPR crowd. He used to write for
the New York Times and got famous trafficking in conspiracy theories
during the Bush years. He is the type who claimed Bush was a fascist and
Iraq was the Sudetenland.

The clip is interesting because both men are convinced they are opposed
to the system, when in fact they are products of the system. This is not
an act. They truly think they are the *avant garde* trying to organize a
revolt against the system. Further, both seem to think they are working
class heroes, leading the proletariat in their struggle against the
bourgeois oppressor class. There are times when they sound like a museum
exhibit explaining the 1930’s union movements.

Jimmy Dore is a rich guy who lives in a two-million dollar home in
California, while Hedges is a rich guy who lives in a mansion in
Princeton New Jersey. That is one of the tonier neighborhoods in
America. They owe everything that truly matters to them to the system
they pretend to oppose. If there was a revolution, they are the on the
first train cars heading to the gulags. The only thing more ridiculous
than these two talking revolution is the fact that they seem to believe
it.

An amusing sidebar here is that they both have put a lot of effort into
retconning their life story to match their roles. Hedges claims to have
grown up working class, but his family sent him to elite boarding
schools. But hey, the
<a href="https://www.loomischaffee.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Chaffee school</a> is pretty much a juvenile detention
center. Dore carries on like his father was Archie Bunker, but in
reality, he was a cop who owned a construction business. The system they
claim to oppose has been very good to the both of them.

Other than the entertainment value, the reason to pay attention to these
sorts of people is they offer an insight into the people in charge. The
typical person in mainstream politics suffers from the same sort of
self-delusion. Few have ever done real work or known anyone who does
real work. Their entire lives have been inside the world of make
believe, where they struggle with other actors, pretending to care about
the people outside the bubble.

Just as conservatism is a bone the system throws to middle-class white
people to keep them busy; socialism is a bone tossed to upper-middle
class white people to make them feel special. One of the remarkable
features of the Bernie Bro phenomenon is that it is whiter than a Klan
rally. Scroll through the clips of the Jimmy Dore show or the Young
Turks and it is nothing but palefaces. In no way does this brand of
radicalism look anything like the people they claim to represent.

The self-delusion is not a one-way street. There are cynical people in
politics, for sure, but most really believe what they are saying.
Elizabeth Warren holds court in her mansion telling the wealthy hens in
her circle about how she is fighting for working families and the
victims of Wall Street. They all congratulate themselves on being the
conscience of the people. All of these people are high on their own
fumes, which is what keeps them from facing reality.

The thing about the concept of false consciousness is that Engels was
inadvertently signaling what would become a prominent feature of
radicalism. It is not the subordinate classes that are the victims, but
rather the radicals themselves. Whether it is civic nationalists and
their utopian fantasies about the Constitution or the middle-class
socialists and their utopian fantasies about economics, radicalism
requires the participants to live in a state of smug self-delusion.

Perhaps it is the nature of all political systems to delude the
beneficiaries, so they do not have to face the reality of their
position. The king can know himself, but his court must believe they are
acting in the name of honor. The crafty political operator can be as
cynical as he likes, but his supporters must see him as a man of virtue,
selflessly serving the republic. In liberal democracy, it is the
narcotic of radicalism played out in the comfort of the gated mansion.
