Most people, whether they admit it or not, accept the basic premises of
what is commonly called Human Bio-Diversity. We tend to live around
people who look like us and think like us. It is why after more than
half a century of trying, the United States is as segregated as it was
before civil rights. Humans naturally self-segregate and that is both
natural and based in natural properties.

The term Human Bio-Diversity is credited to Steve Sailer, who years ago
hosted an email list using that label to discuss advances in the human
sciences. For a time, the HBD subculture functioned as a sort of
counterculture, reacting to the dominant blank slate culture, while
refuting their claims about the human condition. It has remained a
gateway drug for many who end up in the dissident camp.

Thirty years ago when *The Bell Curve* was released, what would become
the HBD world was primarily focused on intelligence. After close to a
century of systematically measuring human intelligence and comparing the
results to various social outcomes, science seemed to prove what people
have always suspected. Intelligence is heritable and genetically
determined.

Over the last thirty years, managerial culture has turned against the
human sciences in an effort to defend their blank slate presuppositions.
If IQ is mostly about genes and most of the rest is about home
environment, which is also mostly about genes, then most of what makes
up pedagogy is as empirical and tarot card reading. This is the topic of
Ed Dutton’s new <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Classroom-Evolutionary-Psychology-School-ebook/dp/B0CP45HJYK/034"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> *The Naked Classroom*.

The book sets out to do three things within the context of education.
One is it explains why schools and schoolteachers tend to be far left.
Dutton relies on the human sciences to explain the qualities that are
selected for by schools, but also what types of people will be attracted
to education. The chapter on the biological basis for homosexuality is
both enlightening and disturbing in this context.

The second goal of this book is to function as a breezy summary of what
we know about human cognition for the average reader. Simply knowing
that intelligence can be measured is not useful without some real-world
examples that show how intelligence plays a role in every aspect of
life. For example, boys reach puberty later than girls, which is why
they seem dumber than girls pre-teen.

The final goal of the book is to explain how intelligence and dimensions
of personality, the Big Five, explain the cultural trends. People with
slightly above average intelligence tend to be more compliant with
social trends because they quickly see the benefit in participating in
the latest thing. This explains why the woke always tend to be midwits
with impressive credentials but limited practical knowledge.

For those looking for a gentle introduction to the HBD topic, then this
is an excellent book to buy and read. Dutton is aiming at the general
reader looking for a place to start and he is a very capable teacher.
His YouTube channel is popular because he is also a highly entertaining
presenter. It is a short book that covers the main topics of
intelligence, personality, and human differences.

This brings up the main problem in the book. If you are a fan of the
Jolly Heretic YouTube channel, then you have heard Dutton discuss the
material in the book many times on his show. In fact, the book is a
written summary of the last couple of years of his video work. In other
words, it is not a book for those already familiar with Ed Dutton or the
general ideas within the human bio-diversity subculture.

Another nit that can be picked is that Dutton hints around at the
question of whether people can be trained to be logical, but he never
takes it head on. This is the general flaw with the HBD space. They get
to the water’s edge but never come to the inevitable conclusion that
must follow their observations. If who we are is written in our code,
then the liberal project is nothing more than superstition.

For example, if what science tells us about male homosexuality is
largely correct, then logically we should never permit male homosexuals
to be around young males without strict supervision. In fact, we should
be aggressively screening out homosexuals from schools, youth groups and
so forth. Of course, suggesting this means men with guns are sent to
throw you into the void.

In other words, if the people with real power refuse to go where science
about human nature must lead, then what is the point of knowing any of
this? Further, there must be some material explanation for why people
with heads full of oogily-boogily seem to rise to the top of liberal
societies. Perhaps evolution does not care about empiricism as much as
the fans of evolutionary biology insist.

In fairness, this is not the point of the book, so Dutton cannot be
faulted for not diving into this topic. He also has to worry about being
hurled into the void. In the end, the evolutionary imperative may simply
shrug off liberalism like a case of fleas and it will follow other
oogily-boogily into the dustbin of history. In the fullness of time, the
HBD people will be proven correct about the reality of the human
condition.

In the end, a book is judged by how well it achieves what the author
sets out to do, not by what some crank in the critic community thinks it
should have done. In his short summary of how IQ and personality shapes
education in the West, Dutton ticks all of the boxes he set out to tick.
The result is a great gift to the dissident curious who needs a gentle
introduction to the topic as they sit by the pool this summer.
