Way back when the tech oligarchs began to censure people, the primary
reaction was that this was not allowed. Americans had been operating
under the assumption that we had the right to speak freely about
politics and we had the right to hear others speak freely about
politics. That was the rule. What these tech companies were doing was
un-American and immoral. In other words, they were breaking the rules.

It did not take long before people started losing respect for the rules,
since they were no longer being applied fairly. Working around the
arbitrary enforcement of ever-changing rules is now a primary
enterprise. The new normal is that the people with power exercise it
arbitrarily and capriciously. As a result, the people who prided
themselves on obeying the rules now have no respect for the rules.

That has been the biggest change in the last half dozen years. It used
to be that a room full of dissidents would be talking about how we can
get the state to do a better job enforcing the rules. Now, the room is
full of people who laugh at the rules and talk about ways to get around
the latest schemes by the rule makers to benefit themselves and their
allies at the expense of the decent people.

All of sudden, billions of people around the world are having the same
sort of conversion in their minds. The Global American Empire is
literally trying to de-platform an entire country. They are threatening
to do the same to anyone who helps the Russians evade the effort. The
rest of the world is about to learn something American dissidents have
learned. You cannot trust the rule makers.

This was madness when inflicted on citizens, but it is suicidal when
scaled up to the world as a whole. Does Washington really think they can
send the world a notice that they have changed the terms of service?
That is what we are seeing. We are seeing Western governments seize
Russian property, for no other reason that the terms of service have
been changed and property rights no longer exist.

What the Russo-Ukrainian war is testing is whether Karen culture can
become a ruling ideology of the Global American Empire. Russia is
unhappy with NATO and Ukraine, so Washington demanded to speak to
Russia’s manager. When that failed, they launched a de-platforming
campaign on social media. Millions of American zombies have joined in on
the campaign to destroy Russia.

The madness of this is that the Global American Empire has rested on the
fact that America could be trusted to enforce and abide by the rules.
Sure, with power comes privilege and one of the benefits for America has
been flexibility on the rules, like we saw with the Iraq invasion. In
general, the empire was built on a set of rules that were promoted by
and defended by the American empire.

Now the rules no longer matter. Where does that leave the moral
authority of the Global American Empire? It is too soon to know, but we
see Russia, China and now India adjusting to this reality. That means
developing a parallel set of systems and institutions, something we have
seen in America. Soon, most of the world’s people will live outside and
opposed to the American rules

In the end, that means death to the Global American Empire. Just as we
see domestically, the collapse of moral authority means the only way to
maintain power is through force. Washington can bully Americans around,
but she cannot expect to bully the world around for very long. The cost
becomes prohibitive. What this war has done is bring us to the winter
phase of the Global American Empire.
