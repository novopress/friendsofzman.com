**Note:** For those who Allah has blessed with a soul, there is a

Wolves* up behind the green door. Those without a sub, condemned to a
life of darkness, may Allah have pity on you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For generations, one of the ironies of American politics is that the
rank and file of the two main factions never get what they want but they
stick with their side. The recent election is a good example of this as
the “winning team” was immediately finked on by their party. They
thought the message they sent to their leaders and the rulers is they
are done with the craziness. The Republican leaders promptly supported
the Democrats in generating more crazy.

It has been noted before that for the people who call themselves
conservative and support the Republican Party, their best president was
Bill Clinton. His was the most conservative administration since
Eisenhower, according to the modern definition of conservative. The
worst president was George W. Bush, the guy the Republican Party claimed
was the epitome of conservatism. Conservative voters still hate Bill
Clinton and mostly ignore Bush.

The Democrat side is not much better. The typical Democrat thought was
Bush was Hitler reimagined, but he gave them almost everything they
wanted. They opposed his crusades against Islam, but only because he was
leading it. They forgot all about their antiwar rhetoric when their guy
was installed to lead the crusade. Their most recent hero, Barak Obama,
delivered on none of his promises to them. Instead, he catered to the
party’s ideological and financial interests

There have been many attempts to explain this. The ideological march to
the Left has been described as the ratchet effect. The political dynamic
is the Left proposes, the Right opposes, and the synthesis is 80% of
what the Left demanded. The cycle repeats with each election to one
degree or another. The result is that America has become increasingly
ideological in its politics and increasingly left-wing. The subsequent
policy changes reflect the ideological march to the Left.

This may have been true in the Cold War with regards to domestic policy
and perhaps the muscle memory remains but there is something else. Since
the end of the Cold War, the American Left embraces *cultural* Marxism.
The old liberalism, which was very lightly decorated with Marxist
rhetoric, has given way to a politics of critical theory and Gramscian
cultural politics. The Left is now purely about agitation and menticide
in order to undermine and collapse the dominant culture.

This has led to a change in what conservatism sells to its side of the
fight. The subplot of Republican politics is now stability, safety, and
normalcy. The constant crisis of corruption that marked the Clinton
years was replaced by the patriotic normalcy of the Bush years. The
Republicans are now selling this as an antidote to the uncertainty and
instability of the Trump – Biden years. The Virginia election was all
about a return to normalcy so conservative voters could go back to
grilling.

The new dynamic, new as in the last thirty years, is a clash of visions
divorced from actual policy disputes. The one side promises to subvert,
disrupt, and confront the prevailing order. The other side promises to
supply stability, safety, and a sense of normalcy to society. One side
wants to shake the snow globe until is it destroyed and the other side
wants to place it back on the shelf so it can settle. Both sides agree
on the shared premise of their position.

That shared premise is supplied by the Left. The core assumption of the
modern Left is the Marxist assumption. Man is naturally communistic. The
old Marxists thought it was the economic arrangements of capitalism that
locked man into a competitive struggle with himself, rather than
settling into his natural communism. The new Marxists think the villain
is culture. They have seized control of the means of cultural production
so they can liberate man from bourgeois society.

The so-called conservatives, perhaps unwittingly, accept this premise.
They seek to prevent the Left from shaking society apart with their
endless disruptions. Their defense of the status quo is not so much a
defense of the natural order, something they now fear uttering even in
private. Instead, their defense of the present order is simply to
provide them with a role in the process. The Left proposes and the Right
opposes is now the Left disrupts and the Right cleans up the mess.

This was why both sides feared and hated Trump and his supporters. It is
not a policy issue or even a presentation issue. It is the clash of
visions. The people most enthusiastically on the side of Trump think
that man’s natural state is not communistic but orderly and
hierarchical. They think if the prevailing orthodoxy collapses, what
rises from the ashes is not communism but a new traditionalism. More
important, the Left will no longer have barricades behind which they can
hide.

This is why the critiques of Trump by people claiming to be outside the
political dynamic are narrow and childish. He was not the Pinochet they
imagined, so they slammed their rattle on the highchair and threw a
tantrum. Just as the Trump phenomena exposed the hollowness of
conservatism, it revealed the shallowness of what is often fobbed off as
a dissident critique of it.  They failed to understand that Trump was
just a wrecker who wanted to tear it down and let nature take its
course.

In fairness, Trump may not even get this deeper meaning of his politics,
as he is not inclined to intellectual introspection. Most of his red-cap
wearing loyalists are blissfully unaware of this sort of analysis. That
is not the point. The point is they start from the assumption that if
they could burn it all down, what would naturally rise up in its place
is the sort of orderly hierarchy the genuine Right thinks is man’s
nature. It is a rejection of the core belief of the ruling orthodoxy.

The lesson here is that a genuine opposition should look at the calls
for stability and normalcy the same way they view the calls for
subversion and disruption. They are two sides of the same coin, two
dancing partners heading to the same end. The antidote to left-wing
disruption is not stability, but right-wing disruption that helps break
the white middle-class of its addiction to stability and compromise. A
genuine alternative seeks to radicalize rather than anesthetize the
middle-class.
