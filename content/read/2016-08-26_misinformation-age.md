In the olden thymes it was much more difficult to be misinformed than it
is today, simply due to the fact that information flowed much more
slowly that we see today. That meant stupid ideas and nonsense passed
from person to person at the speed of foot, not the speed of light.
Festus could truly believe that eating cow dung cured gout, but he was
not at a university writing papers on it. Those papers were not being
spread around the internet. He was simply boring his family with his
crackpot ideas and maybe some neighbors.

The flip side of this, of course, is people were much less informed
about the world than today for the same reasons.
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/" target="_blank">Literacy
rates rocketed up</a> with the advent of cheap printed material, but
information still moved slowly. You can pack a lot of information in a
book, but it still must be toted from one reader to another. It’s
entirely possible that the newly literate of the 18th century were not
much more informed about the world than the illiterate of the 15th
century. Farmer John in colonial Virginia would know more about the
Bible and local politics than Farmer Aethelred in the 15th century, but
maybe not that much more.

We don’t think about mass misinformation very much today, but maybe we
should think about it. That came to mind what I stumbled upon <a

<a href="https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/david-buss/" target="_blank">I
looked up the lead author</a> and he is not a quack working on TV so
this is supposed to be accepted as legitimate science. Just in case the
reporter got the facts wrong, which is often the case, <a
href="http://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2013/02/The-Mate-Switching-Hypothesis-FINAL-PUBLISHED-2017.pdf"
target="_blank">I looked up the source paper</a>. The highlighted parts
of the quote are the important bits. There have been studies using real
science that strongly suggest humans in Europe are predisposed to
monogamy. Genetic testing reveals that a tiny percentage of children are
the result of adulterous relations and this is data going back
centuries.

One could argue, and the paper does leave this open, that women scheme
to have a ready replacement in case their husbands get eaten by a saber
tooth. That’s not implausible and it would certainly show up in the gene
pool as a heritable trait if it were in fact an adaptation.You could
also claim that women secretly scheme to have an in-ground pool or a
vacation to the beach. This sort of “research” is no longer science and
well into idle speculation and propaganda.

This is also the sort of nonsense that is pleasing to the managerial
elite because their religion tells them that monogamy and stable
families are bad for the peasants. They may live like Victorians, but
you people should give up your quaint notions of family, fidelity and
morality, cause science!. This ties in with the assertion by feminists
that women should have unlimited sex partners. A new movie called
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1473832/" target="_blank">Bridget
Jones’s Baby</a>, which features a pregnant woman with three potential
fathers of her baby, is the sort of idealized woman our betters imagine
for your daughter.

That brings us back to where we started. In an age when information was
scarce, misinformation was scarce. In an age where information is
voluminous and moves at light speed, the same is true of the nonsense,
which is much easier to produce in volume. The result is a
misinformation age that erodes trust in authority because over time even
the most naive grows cynical about what they see in the media. How many
junk science stories like the one referenced here get posted before
people think science is nonsense?

It’s not just science. The news media has collapsed under an avalanche
of nonsense they created. No one believes anything they see reported.
Government has approval rates in the teens. We are well into becoming a
low-trust society that can only be held together by force. A big cause
of that is the daily barrage of nonsense we get through the media. There
used to be a time when the responsible made an effort to stem the flow
of nonsense, but that’s no more. Instead, we live in a misinformation
age.

It’s not going to end well.
