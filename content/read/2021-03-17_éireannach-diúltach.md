Today is St. Patrick’s Day, which is when people around the English
speaking world celebrate having driven the Irish from their community.
Businesses dust of the old “Irish Need Not Apply” signs and post them
up. People mock the Irish by getting drunk and starting fights in
public. Everyone wears green. Going out for corned beef and cabbage is a
big thing, even during the pandemic. The meal is capped off by leaving a
small tip in the tradition of the flintiest people on earth.

This is not true, of course, but it would probably be a better way to
respect the Irish people than the current way of celebrating the day.
St. Patrick’s Day in America is mostly just another version of Cinco de
Mayo. That is, a reason for restaurants to roll out some themed specials
and college kids to wear silly outfits. The difference is the college
kids will not get in trouble for making fun of the Irish or for
culturally appropriating them by wearing stereotypical Irish clothing.

The Irish are, however, a good topic for dissidents to study. Ireland
struggled through a long and unpleasant occupation by a people who
sounded a lot like them and looked like them but were not them at all.
The Irish were ruled for a long time by clever, resourceful aliens.
Crushing Irish resistance became an obsession with the British at times,
even when it was not in their interest. This is, of course, the
situation for white people in America now, just without an armed
resistance yet.

How the Irish fought the British and how the British fought back is
something highly relevant to modern America. The Irish eventually won
their independence by driving up the cost of occupation. This came at a
heavy cost to the Irish, as well. There are more people of Irish descent
in America than in Ireland, because the long battle with the British
made living anywhere else better for most Irish. There is also the fact
that Ireland was never and will never fully united under the Irish flag.

Ireland is also a great example of how negative identity can destroy a
people much faster than a conqueror. The Irish during the struggles
became a people defined by their hatred of the British and their long
history of oppression by the British. This made them wholly unequipped
to go into the world as a full independent people. Ireland was
immediately consumed by globalism. First it was the boom-bust of global
economics and then it was the homogenization of global culture.

Starved of its ancient enemy, the Irish had no reason to exist, so the
Irish ruling class joined the global ruling class, in spirit if not
actuality. What that means for Europeans is embracing a plan of
self-eradication. They elected a gay Indian as their ruler and set about
importing as many nonwhites as they could find. Ireland’s Project 2040
promises to import a million Africans. If you do the math, they plan to
make the Irish a minority in Ireland in this century. It is a plan for
national suicide.

There is a popular meme where you see American soldiers disembarking on
D-Day being told their kids will be trans or some other equally vulgar
fad. The idea is that if our ancestors knew what defeating the fascists
would lead to in a few generations, they would have refused to fight.
One suspects that if Michael Collins could have seen Leo Varadkar, the
gay Indian prime minister of Ireland, he and his compatriots would have
turned their guns on their own people.

It is no surprise that the Irish have often called themselves the blacks
of Europe, as they share the same sense of identity as American blacks.
The Irish think the comparison works because they are both musical
people, but it works better in the context of negative identity. Both
the Irish and American blacks are defined by their long struggle, real
and imagined, with another people. Without that struggle, the Irish have
ceased to exist in a meaningful way. Like their memories, Irish is
history.

There is a lesson here for dissidents across the West. It is not enough
to hate the ruling class and hate the liberal democratic system that
sustains them. Hatred is a powerful motivator and a powerful rallying
cry. It can only be a tactic in the larger strategy for national
independence.  It may feel good to hate a person or a group of people,
but it can never come to define you or your people. By rooting identity
in the relationship with another group, you become that group’s slave.

This is why Jews have survived as a tiny minority, often among people
who hate them, without having to assimilate. Jewish identity is a
positive one. It is largely the same in all times and all places. They
adjust to the host population or in the case of Israel, the relative
strength of her neighbors. Otherwise, Jewish identity in 19th century
Russia is the same as in 21st century Manhattan. The people and places
change, but Jews and the complaints about them remain the same.

This is why “Yes, But Is It Good for the Jews?” is an old punchline to
jokes. Jews are famous for always thinking first about whether some
situation, even a disaster, is good for them and their people. They <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-But-Good-Jews-Beginners/dp/1596912057"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke about it</a> among themselves. No
one ever asked, is it good for the Irish, but plenty of Irish wondered
if it was bad for the British. They were, in effect, putting the
interest of the British ahead of their own. Because they have a positive
identity, Jews never think this way.

If the pubs are open in your part of the hellscape that is Covidian
America, enjoy a green beer and some inauthentic Irish culture.
Everyone, even the Irish, are entitled to have some fun when the chance
arrives. In between points of green beer, think about why Irish has been
reduced to a trashy holiday and how best the fight for national
sovereignty can avoid the fate of the Irish. If freedom means infinity
Africans and gay Indian prime ministers, what is the point of the
struggle?

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
