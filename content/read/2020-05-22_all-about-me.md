After a while of doing this, you get to see the patterns. Certain times
of the year have high traffic to the site, more comments and so on.
Other times of the year it goes the other way, sometimes in the extreme.
Most years, the week leading up to Memorial Day in the United States is
one of the slowest weeks. Independence Day is another dead period for
the site. It makes sense and is encouraging. People are thinking about
outside stuff, so they don’t have time for politics.

This year has not been much different, despite the fact everyone has
been stuck at home for going on two months. Around here, people would
normally be headed to the beach or off to the woods for camping and
hiking. The locals would be looking forward to a long weekend of
shooting at one another. The lock down has been lifted by the state, but
local government continues to keep the policies in place, so the beach
and camping are closed. Gun play is still possible.

Still, traffic has ticked down, so I thought it would be a good week to
catch up on the mail bag, but the mail has gotten away from me again. I
sat down last night to clean out the inbox and the task was too much. I
did notice a lot of familiar questions from unfamiliar correspondents.
That spawned the brilliant idea of doing a show on the most common
questions I get from readers and listeners. All of them are about me in
some way, hence the title of the show this week.

I have to say that I did not like how it came out. I’m not a fan of
talking about myself, as I’m not that interesting. It’s not false
modesty. It is reality. No one is really that interesting when you think
about it. You can do interesting things or have interesting experiences,
but those things are not dependent upon you to be interesting. Throw
Fred from accounting into the middle of a street riot and Fred will have
some fun stories for the next office party. Fred, however, is still a
boring guy.

That said, I have been studying live streaming for the last couple of
months, as I have been contemplating that avenue. One of the things I’ve
noticed is all of the popular streamers are highly personal in their
presentation. They talk about themselves endlessly on their shows. That
may be the appeal. For the people watching these shows, it’s like having
the streamer in the home. Even TV chat show hosts are not as personal in
their presentation as the live streamer.

What that means is if you wish to be a modern media star these days, you
will have to endlessly talk about yourself. That’s probably why the
space is so heavy with women and gay men. That’s the other thing I’ve
noticed about the live stream world. It has a lot of girls and gay guys.
At least I think they are girls and gays. You never can tell for sure,
as some of them may be
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA0Xk8n2IPE"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a man dressed as a woman
claiming to be deer</a>. Some claim to be
<a href="https://youtu.be/J6qmToU_6MM" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">hundreds of people</a> trapped in a girl’s body.

This is a familiar topic, but there has to be consequences to having the
public space dominated by lunatics. Even assuming they are harmless
lunatics, like the guy in drag claiming to be Bambi. It is impossible to
have a serious conversation with someone in that condition. Why would
you? It is impossible to be mature and thoughtful in the presence of
someone claiming to be a deer. It means all serious conversation about
serious issues will be crowded out by the lunatics.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
