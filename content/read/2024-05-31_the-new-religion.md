The show was put together before the Trump verdict, so it is not about
the Trump verdict or how we are supposed to think and feel about it. It
is a shame, in a way, as the topic of the show gets at the reason the
regime is persecuting Trump. From their point of view, he is not just a
heretic, but a genuine threat to the new religion because he operates
outside the framework of the new religion.

The reason they often refer to Trump as a racist, but not an antisemite,
is they associate him with the region they continue to see as a holdout,
in defiance of the dictates of the new religion, which is the South.
Trump represents exclusion and hierarchy, which are the things they
associate with the South and what they oppose. He also represents
unreconstructed whiteness.

The funny thing about this new religion is that it is not entirely clear
that the adherents understand that they are following the dictates of a
new religion. The low-level zombies who charged and convicted Trump are
not very smart and they seem to lack self-awareness, so they are most
likely acting on instinct. The new religion is just what everyone they
know says, so they believe it.

This may even be true higher up. People at the highest reaches of the
managerial hierarchy often talk about themselves as if they are the
oppressed, fighting the gathering storm of exclusion and discrimination.
The fat women in the clip I played during the show has been handed a
charmed life but speaks of herself in terms we would expect from a
political prisoner or a crime victim.

The joke from the old movie the *Usual Suspects* is that “The greatest
trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn’t exist.”
Perhaps the greatest trick from the usual suspects is to create a
religion the adherents do not know exists. The power of the open society
is that it habituates the people in it in such a way that this alien
religion becomes a habit of mind.
