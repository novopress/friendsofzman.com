One of the stranger things about the modern age, is watching people in
the media discuss topics, as if they are experts, despite the fact they
know very little about the subject. The recent “hacking” stories are a
great example. Day after day, people who struggle to remember their ATM
PIN, went on at length about the details of computer trespass. Of
course, these nitwits know nothing about technology, but they were sure
super villains from the FSB were secretly gaining access to the
computers of the Democrats.

The people “reporting” on this story are not just ignorant about the
topic. They think they know lots of things that are hilariously wrong
because they get all of their information from television. They keep
using the word “hacking”, for example, because they see it used on TV
crime shows, along with the scruffy looking slackers, sitting in front
of multiple monitors as they gain access to top secret computers. It is
the

target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger</a> effect or perhaps the <a

target="_blank">Charles Bukowski</a> effect, if that’s your inclination.

The pseudo-intellectual poser has become a feature of our mass media
culture. <a

target="_blank">David Brooks</a>, at the New York Times, is a good
example of the type. According to his biography he has no math or
science, not even a familiarity with economics, but <a

As soon as the phrase “market incentives” comes up, you know that there
is no existing market. This is phrase cooked up by managerial class
types so they can engage in central planning, but pretend they have
respect for free markets. Incentives are synthetic creations to get
people to do things they otherwise would not do. If you want a market,
you don’t want central planners dreaming up incentives to warp the
market. What would be the point? You want the buyers and sellers to sort
things out among themselves.

Pseudo-intellectual posers like Brooks don’t understand this because he
does not have the slightest idea how any of it works, but he is willing
to expound on just about everything as if he is an expert. That’s a
problem we have in the mass media age. The alleged experts that citizens
rely on for opinions, spend all their time filling the air with
laughable nonsense. In health care, for example, most Americans not only
think it is a right, they think it is a product that should never be
rationed. This is compete lunacy, but you can’t blame people for
thinking it. All the “smart” people say it on television.

All goods and services are rationed. The question with health care is
how is it to be rationed. Will it be by price or by a monopoly of
supply? Progressives want the latter so that their coreligionists on the
health care boards can murder enemies of the faith by denying them
health care. The alternative should be arguments in favor of free
markets, but instead we get magical thinking from guys passed off to us
a conservatives by the mass media. The result is an
increasingly misinformed public.

The assumption at the dawn of the communication age was that the free
flow of information, and the explosion of new media, would make for
better informed citizens. The result seems to be the opposite.
Middle-brow intellectuals, who used to serve the middle-class, are now
just pseudo-intellectual dufuses. Their game is not to inform, but to
strike the appropriate pose so their readers can have their
beliefs validated. One sure way to get rich in this age is to be <a
href="http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/thomas-friedmans-house/view/google/"
target="_blank">a media guy who is wrong all the time</a>.

Idiotizing the general public is not necessarily a society killing act,
but the people who rule over us appear to be getting drunk off the
fumes. Paul Ryan is allegedly the smartest policy wonk in Washington.
Yet, he is running around with his own ten thousand page bill he says
will make health care free for everyone. We have our spy agencies
pretending to investigate Russian hacking because
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUNPMPrxvA"
target="_blank">President Camacho</a> is demanding it. There is a limit
to how much nonsense a society can believe. We seem to be bumping
against that limit.
