Historians disagree about when the Roman Republic ended. Some argue that
it was when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tiberius Gracchus</a> stood
for re-election as tribune in 132 BC. Some argue it was when
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Julius Caesar</a> crossed the
Rubicon refusing to disband his army and submit to the Senate. some
argue in favor of the *lex frumentaria* as the beginning of the end.
That’s the law passed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gaius Gracchus</a> providing
subsidized grain to the poor.

It is one of those debates historians and cranks enjoy having as there
is no right answer, just what works for your theory about the present.
You pick a date that fits your needs and go from there. The best case
for the end is when Tiberius Gracchus stood for re-election in 132 BC.
It was at this point when the ruling elite of Rome, the patrician class,
lost their respect for their own rules.

At that point the law was no longer the agreed upon rules under which
they would settle their differences. It became an obstacle to power or a
weapon to wield against rivals once you attained power. The spirit of
the law, the point of the law, no longer matteredto the people charged
with enforcing the laws. From there is was a short road to a “who,
whom?” social order.

Of course, none of this could have happened without the destruction of
the small landowners after the destruction of Corinth and Carthage. In
146 BC the Romans finally defeated their old enemies. Both cities were
destroyed in spectacular fashion. The Romans burned the cities, killed
all of the men and sold the women and children into slavery. That
created a glut of cheap labor.

The influx of slaves changed the economics of the Republic. Large
landowners could now replace their free Roman labor with slaves. This
undercut the small landowners, who could not compete with slave labor.
The result  was a consolidation of the land and a massive influx of
people into the city, mostly former farmers and soldiers. This removed
the check on the ruling elite.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> from yesterday
makes suggests we are firmly in the lawlessness stage of decline that we
saw with the Romans. The people in charge no longer respect the laws
that are supposed to keep them in power.

*Senior White House officials are in talks with business leaders that
could expand the executive actions President Barack Obama takes on
immigration.*

*Obama was initially expected to focus only on slowing deportations of
potentially millions of undocumented immigrants and altering federal
enforcement policies. Now top aides are talking with leaders in big
companies like Cisco, Intel and Accenture, hoping to add more changes
that would get them on board.*

*Representatives for high-tech, agriculture and construction interests
have put forward a range of fixes, from recapturing unused green cards
to tweaking existing work authorization programs.*

*The outreach is an effort to broaden the political support for Obama’s
decision to go it alone on immigration — another sign that suggests the
White House fears a backlash in November, particularly among independent
voters in battleground Senate races where Republicans are seizing on the
issue.*

*“The president has not made a decision regarding next steps, but he
believes it’s important to understand and consider the full range of
perspectives on potential solutions,” said White House spokesman Shawn
Turner. “The meetings were in keeping with the president’s commitment to
do whatever he can, within the constraints of the law, to address the
immigration issue.”*

*Turner said the meetings with business leaders were among more than 20
“listening sessions” with outside groups.*

*“They are very seriously looking at a big variety of things to figure
out what people think would be helpful,” a source in one of the meetings
said, describing the meeting as a “productive listening session.”*

*Senior administration officials stepped up their engagement with
companies and business groups over the past month as they look to
produce a series of executive orders starting in September. Aides are
asking industry executives for ideas and are trying to earn their
support against an expected barrage from Republicans opposed to Obama
taking any action.*

You’ll notice that the Obama administration is not looking for how they
can enforce the spirit of the laws passed by the people’s
representatives. They are not looking at the law as a limit to their
power. They are looking at the law as an obstacle and spending all of
their time scheming to get around it.

All of those quislings from corporate America in there know they are a
part of an effort to subvert the law and harm the American people. They
just want to line their pockets with your money. If we had any sense,
the roads leading out of Washington would resemble the Appian Way after
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Servile_War"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Third Servile War</a>.

No one can point to a single line in the Constitution that gives the
president this power, but the Constitution is a museum piece now. No one
can point to anything in the law that gives him this right. Obama
probably does not understand any of it, but the people around him surely
know it. They don’t care about the law or the results that will flow
from their lawlessness. Whether or not it is the point of no return is
unknown, but it is on the way to a might makes America.
