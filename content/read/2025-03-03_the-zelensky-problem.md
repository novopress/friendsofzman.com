with Paul Ramsey every Wednesday at 8:00 which you can watch live on <a
href="https://rumble.com/v6pnuj6-wednesday-wrap-up-february-26-2025.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rumble</a> and

target="_blank">YouTube</a> and, of course, watch at your leisure after
the fact.

**Note \#2:** Behind the green door, there is a post about the events of
last Friday, a post about the importance of knowing who is in charge,
and the Sunday podcast. Subscribe

**Note \#3:** Since we are getting signs of spring, it means it will not
be long before it is hot, which means t-shirt weather. Just in time for
t-shirt season, we have a new shirt for The Occidental Club, which you

Ronald Reagan was famous for saying that “the closest thing to
immortality is a government program.” He was not the first person to say
it. There are examples of American politicians saying a version of this
going back to the 1930’s. There are probably versions of this concept
going back to the Kingdom of Ur, because it is the nature of government
to create constituencies in favor of its actions and those
constituencies always lobby for more of what created them.

You see this with Project Ukraine, which was largely created by a small
number of zealots called the neocons in the Obama administration. They
overthrew the government of Ukraine, installed an anti-Russian
government and just like that there was money and opportunity in
Ukraine. By the time Trump came along in 2016, the Ukraine project had a
sizable constituency in the Western ruling class, which is why Trump was
impeached. He threatened the project.

Since the war broke out in 2022, the power of the Project Ukraine
constituency has grown much stronger for monetary and political reasons.
Important interests in Western countries are making money from the war,
so they support politicians who seek to keep the war going. The
politicians are happy to oblige, as the war is a nice distraction from
the boring tasks the voters expect from government, tasks that the
political class has thoroughly and completely ignored.

There is also the fact that the European political class operates like a
preschool, where they are the children, and the United States is the
teacher. Ending Project Ukraine is like forcing them into regular school
or maybe sending them home to parents who do not fawn over them like
their teachers. The reality of Europe is bleak, largely due to the
perfidy of the Europeans political class. They prefer not to face that
and instead fixate on this glorious adventure in which they are the
heroes.

Of course, like all government programs, there is the program itself,
which always adheres to the iron law of bureaucracy. In any bureaucratic
organization there will be two kinds of people. There will be those who
are devoted to the goals of the organization and those dedicated to the
organization itself. The second group will gain and keep control of the
organization. We see this with how the Blob is fighting DOGE like
Grendel facing off against Beowulf.

This is what we see with Zelensky. He is the anthropomorphized
government program, consumed with defending its prerogatives. It is why
he was so nasty in his trip to the Trump White House. He could not
believe that these people would have the audacity to make demands upon
him. He is the indispensable man, on whose shoulders rests the fate of
the free world and through him is expressed the hopes and dreams of the
managerial class that created him.

This is the problem the Trump administration faces as they seek to wind
down what they consider to be a pointless and costly enterprise. They
wisely drove a stake through the heart of that part of the Blob that has
controlled American foreign policy, which is why official Washington is
struggling to defend Project Ukraine. Legacy media is simultaneously
calling Trump Chamberlain and Hitler – he is somehow appeasing himself –
but otherwise they have no answers.

The Europeans are another matter. They see themselves like the tax
eaters in Washington getting memos from Elon Musk. For them, Project
Ukraine is their reason to exist now, so Trump’s plans to end it are an
existential threat. It is why they cooked up the scheme to trick Trump
into going along with their peacekeeper idea last week and why they are
now busy cooking up a new scheme. Ukraine is their teddy bear, and they
cannot think of being without it.

Zelensky is the key here, as his very life probably depends on this war
never ending, at least not until he has an exit strategy. He cannot make
a deal with the Russians because the ultra-nationalist will not tolerate
it. The only deal he could make is one that requires Russia to
surrender, which is not a possibility. His other choice is fleeing the
country, but he would no doubt be tracked down by enemies. That leaves
him with no other choice but to keep the war going.

One of the truths of a government program is that when it is finally
killed off, the world never ends and the people dependent upon it find
something else. After the initial sobbing and moaning, the dogs bark and
the caravan moves on. That will be the case with Project Ukraine. What
must happen first is Zelensky must exit the stage, and either be
replaced by chaos or by someone willing to do a deal to end the war. At
that point, the Europeans will adjust to the new reality.

This is where things stand now. At some level the Europeans seem to know
it, which is why they put on a show over the weekend featuring their
favorite comedian. It was a funeral where they could all hug and
reminisce, except the corpse was still walking and talking, demanding
more money and weapons. The reason Zelensky keeps talking about
resigning is he knows that for this program to finally end, he must exit
the stage, so he is hoping to create conditions which drag that out a
bit longer.

While it may feel like government programs are immortal, immune to all
efforts to slay them, nothing lasts forever. That is what we are now
seeing. Along with the death of the 20th century mindset in American
foreign policy is the death of its last great program, Project Ukraine
and its anthropomorphized representation of it. Once Zelensky is gone,
the war ends, and the process of developing new, normalized relations in
Europe begins as we exit the post-Cold War world.
