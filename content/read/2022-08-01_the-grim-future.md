Futurism was a social movement that started in the beginning of the last
century in Italy and spread around the West in the first decades of the
century. The futurists were not content with improvements to everyday
life. They imagine a new world brought about the rapid advance of
technology. The material advances of the industrial revolution would not
just improve our daily lives. They believed the entirety of human
society would be reimagined along technological lines.

The Futurists were not entirely wrong. The industrial revolution did
usher in a mass reorganization of human society. Trains were not just
faster than horses. They changed how we thought about moving people and
goods. Wired and wireless communication added an immediacy to society.
People were no longer finding out what happened after the fact but
following what was happening as it happened. The old culture collapsed
and a new culture arose in the 20th century.

A simple mental exercise makes this clear. A man living in 1750 America
would have had no trouble navigating 1850 America. Sure, trains would be
new to him and industry would be advanced. Otherwise, people lived
pretty much the same. Now, take 1850 man and transport him to 1950. He
would find himself in a world that was not just materially different,
but culturally and spiritually alien. He was not in an improved version
of his country. He was in a different world.

The futurists believed that technological progress would lead to human
progress and by that they meant freedom from the human condition. The
future would be slick, fast and exiting, as humanity explored its
potential. One result of this was a rejection of the past, especially
tradition. The futurists saw the past as a set of hands grasping at
humanity from the grave. Another result is they believed violence was
entirely appropriate to break the grip of the past in order to usher in
the future.

The futurists were not entirely wrong. The two great industrial wars of
the 20th century obliterated the old world. Into the void flowed what
came to be known as the post industrial world. The West was not
capitalist or socialist in the Marxist sense, but something of a fusion
of the two. On the other hand, the human condition was not consigned to
the dustbin of history. All of the old problems remained. The West
simply had better stuff than in the prior ages.

Fast forward to this age and we have a new round of futurism. You can
probably start the clock with Alvin Toffler, a futurist who got famous
at the beginning of the microprocessor revolution. His books sold
millions of copies and focused on society after de-industrialization.
His books were popular in America at a time when the economy was
shedding industrial jobs. His vision of the future promised something
better than the old grimy industrial lifestyle.

Even though his books sold millions of copies, futurism did not catch on
with the beautiful people until the late 1990’s. When technology became
accessible to the technologically challenged, the future suddenly opened
up to them. Apple products were sold to taste makers as a symbol of the
progressive vision. Big tech began to market itself as a lifestyle,
rather than as technological advance. Elon Musk went from bald PayPal
investor to a futurist with a firm hairline.

The reason operations like the World Economic Forum have become popular
with the beautiful people is these organizations are catering to the
people who have tied their sense of self with their vision of the
future. WEF has been around for a long time, but it was mostly a dull
economic conference until they hit on futurism. You see it in this old
<a
href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/goodbye-car-ownership-hello-clean-air-this-is-the-future-of-transport/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation</a> from a person named
Thomas Birr. This is a timeshare pitch tailored for a crowd that
believes they are world historic figures.

It should be noted that Mr. Birr promotes himself as a futurist. He
labels himself the Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer at a company
named E. On. Before that he was Senior Vice President Innovation &
Business Transformation at a company with an equally ridiculous name.
Mr. Birr is a visionary and we know that because he is paid to have
visions, like a shaman. Before he was a visionary, he was an industrial
sales rep who worked in the energy business.

One of the appeals of futurism is that it allows the futurist to look
away from the present and focus on a blank page onto which he can draw
his new world. It is a form of escapism, which suggests futurism is the
product of crisis. The futurists of the last century did not see the two
great industrial wars coming. In retrospect, the obliteration of the old
war was a necessary step toward the new world. Interestingly, the
Italian futurists all wound up supporting fascism.

There is a bit of irony. The futurist of this day invests a lot of time
looking for potential fascists out among the Dirt People. Yet, it can be
argued that fascism would not have been possible without the futurism
movement. Once the focus shifted from the present to the future, the
debate shifted from how to best to manage the present to *who* will run
the society of the future. The great ideological conflicts of the 20th
century were all about *who* will impose their vision of their future.

We see the same debates in this age. Immigration is about the
demographics of future Western society. The antiwhites explicitly state
that they wish to overthrow current society, which they call white
supremacy, in favor of some new society organized around serving
nonwhites. The legacy populations of the West are told by the people at
the World Economic Forum that they are on the wrong side of history. Our
debates about the future are all about *who*, not *what*.

All of this suggests that the futurist is a grim reaper. His arrival
precedes some horrible conflagration that obliterates the present. A
century ago, the futurists gave us two great industrial wars that reduce
the West to ruins. The futurists of this age seem to be obsessed with
war and famine. On the one hand they are instigating wars between the
great powers. On the other hand, they are attacking the food supply. We
will be lucky to live to see whatever futures results from all of this.
