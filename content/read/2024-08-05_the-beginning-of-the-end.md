**Note:** Behind the green door on the great stone of truth I have a
post about the difference between work and exercise, a post about the
alienness of the Democratic ticket and the Sunday podcast. Subscribe

The Nikkei 225 opened the week by plunging 12%, its worst day since the
infamous Black Monday in 1987. European markets followed, but due to
their controls on the markets ever going too far down, they declined
just over two percent. The American markets are expected to open down as
well. As with Europe, there are controls in place to prevent the markets
from sliding too far too fast. This is determined by the Plunge
Protection Team who protect the bankers.

All of this got going last week when markets began to decline and then
it was revealed that the world’s most bullish investor, Warren Buffet,
was dumping stocks at an unprecedented rate over the last quarter.
Berkshire Hathaway <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/08/03/why-warren-buffett-dumped-56-of-berkshires-apple-stock/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">dumped</a> 58% of its Apple stock, which
has been viewed as a signal that Buffett thinks the American economy is
headed for a recession. In lean times, the companies hardest hit are
those who make frivolous items like high end mobile devices.

Even setting aside the economic issues, the market was long overdue for
a correction, and they often happen around elections. When Trump left
office the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 31,000. It peaked
this year at around 40,000, which is roughly a thirty percent climb in
three years. If one wants an example of irrational exuberance, there is
a perfect example. The American stock market is a speculative bubble
that was due to burst.

The speculation mainly rested on the assumption that the Federal Reserve
would once again start handing out free money to its friends. The
inflation reports had been manipulated to the point where the only
people still worried about prices are the people buying things. The jobs
reports and GDP numbers have similarly been set to look as if the
economy could use a jolt of free money. The trouble is Jerome Powell is
not in a rate cutting mood and has made this clear.

The other assumption has been that the American economy is fundamentally
sound and all the bad stuff since Covid has been resolved. That has
turned out to be wrong, as new bad stuff has emerged since Covid. The
new Cold War launched against China and Russia is accelerating changes
in the global economy, which is already putting downward pressure on
Western economies. It seems that investors are now starting to
understand that we are on the cusp of a new world order.

Of course, equities markets are supposed to reflect the general investor
sentiment about the underlying economy. You buy a stock because you
think the company will be better tomorrow than today. You sell the stock
for the opposite reason. The markets are supposed to be about the future
of the underlying economy, but that has not been true for close to forty
years now. Instead, it has been about where to put all the extra cash
the central bank creates in its role as global banker.

What happened to the American stock markets over the last half century
is they went from being a place to bet on the economy and individual
companies to a place to bet on the Global American Empire being the sole
superpower. As long as the dollar remained the global currency and
Washington controlled the rules of the global economy, there was only
one bet to make. Everyone did the rational think and bet on this not
changing, so over time the line <a
href="https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">went up</a> at a steady pace.

The last two years have revealed this to be old thinking. The sanctions
war against Russia has been a disaster for the empire. The Russian
economy has outpaced Western economies during this time. Similarly,
BRICS, which was just a worthless acronym, has now become a legitimate
alternative to the Western model. Their alternative to SWIFT, the
default banking transaction system, is slowly emerging as a viable and
perhaps superior option for the rest of the world.

The main reason for this is the chaos at the top of the imperial order.
While the endless political drama out of Washington entertains the
people of the West, to those outside it looks like chaos and
instability. The world’s largest economies have no idea who is in charge
of imperial policy, as Joe Biden is clearly a vegetable. Further,
Washington is not on speaking terms with the two most important
countries at the moment. They have Russia and Iran on mute.

What we may be about to see is the canary in the coal mine fall off his
perch, thus signaling the great reordering. Western economies evolved
over the last half century on the assumption that Washington would
control the global money supply. Over the last thirty years the
assumption has been that the days of national economies were over, as
all economies would be integrated. The rules based global economy using
the dollar would be run from the imperial capital.

That is not going to be the future. This presents a massive problem for
the West, as industrial policy, economic policy, government policy and
demographic policy has all been based on the assumption that the Western
managerial elite would sit atop this global system like Mustapha Mond,
the world controller in Aldous Huxley’s novel *Brave New World*. Of
course, that is the reason the dream is unraveling, as Mustapha Mond was
both corrupt and cynical.

As is usually the case, the great transition will take time. It took
forty years for the West to evolve down this cul-de-sac. It will take
time for the world to adapt to the decline of the West and for the West
to regain itself. The collapse of the Soviet system was followed by two
decades of disorder. The difference is the West has further to fall, as
the Russians were already poor. Americans are about to get poor because
they no longer deserve to be otherwise.
