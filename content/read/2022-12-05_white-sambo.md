------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the novel *Invisible Man*, an important bit of symbolism is a paper
doll, called a Sambo doll, that was popular in the middle of the last
century. It was often a paper doll made up with exaggerated features of
back people. In the novel, black street sellers would attach the doll to
a string and include a stereotypical song and dance performance as a way
to sell the dolls to passersby. Of course, the passersby were white
people who bought the dolls because it appealed to their racism.

Obviously, the black people selling the dolls were profiting from the
promotion of what the writer saw as a negative stereotype. One
interpretation is that the reason black stereotypes persisted was that
some blacks profited from them. The black people selling the dolls made
money from the suffering of their own people. They were willing to
degrade themselves and their people to make a few dollars. These selfish
acts were a part of the problem facing blacks in America.

It was not cut and dried for the narrator. He could see that the black
men profiting from these stereotypes were simply adapting to reality.
They made money for themselves and their family, which by extension
benefitted the community. Black stereotypes, in effect, created a moral
dilemma for back people. On the one hand, they kept black people down
relative to white people. On the other hand, profiting from these
stereotypes allowed black people to prosper despite their condition.

Later on the novel, the narrator tries to burn one of the Sambo dolls
for heat and finds it difficult to do, symbolizing the difficulty of
overcoming the stereotype. He is eventually able to burn the doll. In
the process he realizes that it may be difficult to overcome the
cultural framing that the Sambo doll symbolized, but it is possible if
one accepts the reality of his condition. The individual can only
transcend his condition by creating and maintaining his own individual
identity.

*Invisible Man* was written seventy years ago, but the problem facing
black people described by Ralph Ellison has not changed. You see it in
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VieI_yLmQkI&amp;t=1s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> of Jared Taylor on the
Young Turks channel. Dr. Rashad Richey is playing a stereotypical black
character, which has been lampooned for generations. He gets to make a
nice living doing it, but like the characters selling Sambo dolls in the
novel, he is profiting from the perpetuation of negative stereotypes of
black people.

An extreme example of this is the Kanye West story. His career has been
built around selling the stereotypical black cultural items, things like
sneakers and expensive lifestyle items, to an audience primarily of
white suburban youth. His own struggle with this reality seems to have
broken him. His most recent interviews suggest he is a man rolling
around in a struggle with own personal Sambo doll, one that he created
and that looks striking like Kanye West, despite the name change.

This moral dilemma applies to anyone who exists outside the moral
consensus and this Kanye West stuff is an example of it. Nick Fuentes
has signed onto what he used to mock just a few years ago. He was the
guy in the so-called optics war who insisted that presentation was
important. He mocked the alt-right people for praising Hitler and
throwing Roman salutes. He is now flying around with a guy who praises
Hitler and makes the alt-right sound philosemitic.

Fuentes, faced with the dilemma described in the novel *Invisible Man*,
the choice between playing the stereotypical role for money and
attention or rejecting that role in order to create and maintain an
individual identity, has chosen the former. Like so many before him,
Fuentes is volunteering to play the role of cartoon Nazi that the system
he claims to oppose needs in order to perpetuate itself. Like the
character in the novel, he is perpetuating a stereotype for profit.

The counter from his fans is that these publicity stunts get attention
and therefore expose people to this material. It brings attention and
resources into the community that lies outside the moral consensus,
which helps the community. In this case, by signing onto the Kanye West
circus, Fuentes raises his profile, which he then uses to promote the
ideas and opinions of his followers. Like the character selling Sambo
dolls in the novel, Fuentes is degrading himself to support his
community.

Here is where the comparison breaks down. Black people in the middle of
the last century faced genuine economic hardship. A man trading his
dignity to feed his kids is making a rational choice. Similarly,
refusing to trade his dignity, even if it means his family suffers, is
also a rational choice. That is the moral dilemma. Both choices are
rationally defensible. Playing the cartoon Nazi for the mass media, on
the other hand, lacks rational support.

The reason is the argument in favor of “getting the word out at all
cost” has been proven false over and over for generations. George
Lincoln Rockwell got the word out by dressing up as Hitler. David Duke
was the preppy Klansman and got a whirl on the big stage in the 1980’s.
Most recently, the alt-right was front page news for a while and nothing
came of it. No minds were changed. It was just another version of the
white Sambo act for the benefit of the people in charge.

Like the narrator in the novel, the only way forward is to step outside
the moral framework and create a new and independent identity. In the
political context, this means a stand alone argument in favor of some
alternative future. There is the list of complaints about the current
system, every cause has a bill of indictment, but it is followed by a
plausible alternative. There is a vision of a future independent of the
current moral framework, not just opposed to it.

Blacks in the middle of the last century were faced with a choice. They
could find a way to live within the system or find a way to live outside
the system. The choice was the former, which has often required a
sublimation to the same sorts of stereotypes that allegedly motivated
the civil rights movement. Agreeing to be one of the forty-two black
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=SpcLu8BX4EY"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> living in the white
nationalist enclave of Brattleboro Vermont is no different than selling
those paper Sambo dolls on the street corner.

In this age, white people are faced with a similar dilemma. One can
simply play the role of suburban peasant until that is no longer
permitted. One can play the white Sambo role pretending it is something
other than theater. Alternatively, one can seek to live outside the
world of racial coercion, looking to a world free of racial coercion.
That is a genuinely break from the past and present. It leaves the
Sambos and the enablers to the dustbin of history.
