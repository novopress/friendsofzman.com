rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I saw this on Drudge</a> and I
could not help but laugh. The breathless reporting of the “gay slur”
like it is a violation of a sacred taboo is sad and funny. That and the
reportette’s unwillingness to actually report what it is the guy put on
the sign. That’s how nutty this religion of liberalism is now. They put
being rude to homosexuals up at the top of the list of taboos, as if the
gays are a sacred class of shamans.

Of course, the ridiculous reporter is probably easily outraged. That’s
what happens when you live your life isolated from large swaths of
reality. According to
<a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/staff/rachel-stockman/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her biography</a>, she popped
out of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and
she has a JD from Yale. Smart gal, who does not have a lick of useful
experience in the world in which most of us live. She may as well be a
space alien covering earth.

Up until recent, reporters were plucked from the ranks of the working
class. A boy with something on the ball, but lacking the resources or
interest in academics could become a reporter. That typically involved a
long apprenticeship working with experienced reporters. It also meant
living among the people they covered. Then the job of reporter became a
profession and a dumping ground for upper middle-class kids, who could
not cut it in professions like finance or law. The result is a media
full of precious sissies.
