Back in 2014, Rolling Stone published a story about an alleged rape on
the campus of the University of Virginia. Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s “A Rape
on Campus” story was a bombshell story that became a national
controversy. It seemed to confirm everything the Nth-wave feminists were
saying about the scourge of white males raping white women on the
college campus. All of the [usual
suspects](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/11/right-and-campus-rape-w-bradford-wilcox/)
rushed to the nearest outlet to display their outrage over the incident.

Of course, this later became known as the “Virginia Rape Hoax” as the
story was completely fake. The only things about it that were true is
the star of the story was a human who attended the university and the
writer used her real name. Otherwise, the story was a total fabrication
and a ridiculous one at that. Sensible people noticed huge problems with
it from the start. The two big clues that it was fake were that it read
like a bodice ripper and the villain was named Haven Monahan.

In retrospect, this story was a turning point for mass media. By the old
rules, everyone involved would have been shamed out of the public eye.
The writer, Sabrina Erdely, would have been drummed out of the
profession. Jackie Coakley, the coed who was the fake victim, would have
been destroyed by an angry media. Erdely faced no repercussions and
still works in the media. Coakley was mostly ignored and has gone on
with her life, not having suffered from it.

The news was always biased and lots of reporters fabricated stories to
fill up their stories, but there was always risk to being a fabulist.
Stephen Glass, the guy who cooked up legendary whoppers while at the New
Republic was drummed out of the business and the reputation of the
magazine was destroyed. Jayson Blair. the black New York Times reporter
was fired for making up stories. Imagine a black reporter being fired
today for anything, much less for slandering white people.

Prior to the Rolling Stone story, a reasonable person knew the media was
biased toward left-wing causes and left-wing institutions. They would
favor the Democrat over the Republican, for example. They would promote
left-wing causes and ignore or dismiss right-wing issues. After the
Rolling Stone hoax, the prudent person assumes that everything in the
media is fake. The question is, what is possibly true and what is the
agenda behind the proposed narrative.

In other words, reading the American media has taken on the same quality
as reading the Soviet media in the Cold War. You read it like you read
any piece of fiction in that you are looking for clues in the narrative
to discovery the deeper meaning. Instead of Kremlinologists, Americans
have to be regime-ologists. The regime media offers clues about what is
going on behind the veil. Those clues help understand the workings of
the inner party and what they are plotting.

Take [this
story](https://news.yahoo.com/operation-whistle-pig-inside-the-secret-cbp-unit-with-no-rules-that-investigates-americans-100000147.html)
in Yahoo News about a high-tension cloak and dagger affair that
supposedly happened in Washington during the Trump years. The story has
a female heroine named Ali Watkins, who is a strong independent female
journalist working for the New York Times. It has a villain, a shady
character named Jeffrey Rambo, who worked at a secretive Customs and
Border Protection division. The two of them engage in a high stakes game
of cat and mouse in the capital.

The story seems ridiculous and oddly familiar. The reason for that is it
is ripped from the ham-fisted television shows about rogue government
agencies. Of course, the main character is described like someone from
female fantasy literature. Instead of the villain being named Haven
Monahan, he is Jeffrey Rambo. The story does not describe him as having
a thick New York accent or dropping from helicopters with a bayonet
between his teeth, but you just know it happened!

There are some things about the story that are true, like the names of
the two main characters, but the story is most assuredly fake. The first
clue the story is made up is that this fantastic story is in Yahoo News,
rather than the New York Times where the protagonist works. Instead, it
is at a C-list outlet written by a nobody whose prior work was reporting
on the FBI. Dumping these stories on nobody reporters is standard
practice for the regime. It is part of the subterfuge.

Another clue is the main character. She is not the strong independent
female journalist speaking truth to power. She is the tramp who was
having sex with James Wolfe, the Security Director of the U.S. Senate
Select Intelligence Committee. He was busted for giving her information
that she used in her stories. She denies it but this is not an issue in
dispute, so we can add liar to the morals charges. Watkins at the time
was in her mid-20’s and Wolfe was in his late-50’s.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but Wolfe was the Security Director
of the U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee for 29 years. This
means he was one of a small number of people seeing the nation’s most
sensitive intelligence data. In other words, he was a professional spook
who knew the game. Most likely, in addition to getting some young flesh
,he was also using Watkins to peddle disinformation. This is not a new
game between “young reporters” and old DC hands.

Using our regime-ology skills we quickly see that the drama of the story
is mostly fake and intended to get attention. The real story is the FBI
is peddling a story to the media that both damages another agency and
helps their friendly media. They picked Jana Winter because she has
nothing else going on, is desperate for a break and has been a willing
stenographer in the past. She will not ask too many questions. Again,
this is old hat in the game of media manipulation.

That raises the question as to why this story was planted by the FBI.
There is the special prosecutor glacially investigating the Russian
collusion hoax and the FBI’s role in promoting it. The Trump people did
use the “rogue agency” in question to uncover the Wolfe-Watkins
operation. It is possible Durham is using the same assets to investigate
the FBI or allies. It could also be another smear job against Trump that
will be later used in the campaign against him.

At this point, it is hard to know, but it is good practice in reading
the media in order to tease out what is happening behind the veil of
secrecy. Given the effort put into writing this whopper, it will come up
again at some point. All we can know is there is trouble inside the
security operations. One branch is not happy with another and is now
taking their war to friendly media. Perhaps soon people will be
airbrushed out of official photos, a practice popular in authoritarian
regimes.
