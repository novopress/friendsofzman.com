My consumption of sports news is about as limited as possible for
someone who still follows sports. I scan the baseball news once a week.
I’ll scan ESPN and CBS Sports. I say “scan” as most of it is just made
up clickbait stuff. The actual  news stories are so poorly written that
they are not worth reading once you have gleaned the news nugget. Most
sports “journalists” try hard to sound like hyper active teenagers,
writing for an audience of semi-literates. We are a long way from Ring
Lardner.

As a result, I took some pleasure in the howling and moaning from sports
media as ESPN made some small cuts to their on-air talent. Of course,
the media covered like it was the end of the world. ESPN cut 100 people
from an 8,000 person workforce. Most people reading this have lived
through layoffs where ten percent of the labor force is cut. The ESPN
cutbacks are trivial, unless you are a media snowflake convinced you are
part of a secular priesthood. Then it is the sign of the apocalypse.

What’s surprising is that operations like ESPN have an audience at all.
Their “news” converge is mostly jock-sniffing and their created content
is so out there on the Progressive fringe, it borders on madness. The
people watching sports and following sporting news are men. Most normal
men are uninterested in Progressive lunacy. They watch sports for a
break or they simply have no interest in other subjects.

The last thing they want to have to suffer through is <a

Poetry is defined as having meter, rhyme or a point. You have to have
two of three in order to qualify as verse. What feminist poet Patricia
Smith writes has none of those things. There’s no such thing as a “bitch
buzzer” and the words conjure no images so the phrase is nonsensical. A
“stupid slap of sugar” is supposed to mean what? Who has ever been
slapped, stupidly or not, with sugar? The entire word jumble is the sort
of thing you would expect from a high school girl, who thinks she is
clever. It’s not even doggerel.

The rest is actually worse, if that’s possible. At some point, writing
of any kind is so bad it is just terrible. There’s a bottom to
terribleness and this junk is there, with all the novels that begin with
“it was a dark and stormy night.” It is no surprise to anyone that
poetry is dead in America and creative writing is on life support. It’s
also no surprise that feminists are terrible writers in addition to
being batshit crazy. The question is why is this crap on a sports site?
Why would anyone consider such a dumb idea?

What’s happening at ESPN is not unique. Fox News has decided that the
way to remedy their high ratings in the cable news wars is to blow up
the station, install a gaggle of blue haired lesbians and become a
shitty version of the worst rated cable news channels. All over the mass
media, it appears the plan is to drive away as many viewers as possible,
by offending some and boring the hell out of the rest. That’s thing.
Most of it is just boring, not so much offensive. Feminist beat poets
are not offensive. They’re stupid and dull.

It’s tempting to go for the reductionist answer and assume it is just
proselytizing paid for by the billionaires who own the mass media
companies. There’s some of that, but the real issue is that people
making editorial decisions are strangers. They don’t know the sort of
people who read the sports pages or follow their favorite team. We’re
just economic units, who are “out there” on the other side of the walls,
so they don’t spend much time thinking about what the typical male
sports fan finds interesting about the sporting news.

The people who thought that weird feminist poetry slam was a great idea,
probably thought it was a great idea. They have heads full of “theories”
about female athletes and “theories” about the twenty people that bother
to watch women’s basketball. They just assume everyone is sitting around
agonizing about how their vagina defines them. There’s no one in the
room willing or able to tell them that feminism is a mental disease and
they should be getting professional help, not reading nonsense like
this.
