Here is <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/379481/why-team-obama-was-blindsided-bergdahl-backlash-ralph-peters"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another take</a> on Obama’s
weirdness. Ralph Peters is a shameless warmonger, but he does have a
good sense of the mood among veterans and active duty.

*<span class="drop">C</span>ongratulations, Mr. President! And identical
congrats to your sorcerer’s apprentice, National Security Adviser Susan
Rice. By trying to sell him as an American hero, you’ve turned a
deserter already despised by soldiers in the know into quite possibly
the most-hated individual soldier in the history of our military.*

*I have never witnessed such outrage from our troops.*

*Exhibit A: Ms. Rice. In one of the most tone-deaf statements in White
House history (we’re making a lot of history here), the
national-security advisor, on a Sunday talk show, described Bergdahl as
having served “with honor and distinction.” Those serving in uniform and
those of us who served previously were already stirred up, but that
jaw-dropper drove us into jihad mode.*

*But pity Ms. Rice. Like the president she serves, she’s a victim of her
class. Nobody in the inner circle of Team Obama has served in uniform.
It shows. That bit about serving with “honor and distinction” is the
sort of perfunctory catch-phrase politicians briefly don as electoral
armor.*

The near total lack of military service is one problem. The greater
problem is the lack of earthling experience. Look at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Rice"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bio of Susan Rice</a>. It is
impressive and so far out of the norm that she may as well be from
another country.

*This is a fundamental culture clash. Team Obama and its base cannot
comprehend the values still cherished by those young Americans “so dumb”
they joined the Army instead of going to prep school and then to
Harvard. Values such as duty, honor, country, physical courage, and
loyalty to your brothers and sisters in arms have no place in Obama
World. (Military people don’t necessarily all like each other, but they
know they can depend on each other in battle — the sacred trust Bergdahl
violated.)*

This understates the differences. Lots of people skipped the military
and went off to college or a job. They live and work with people who
made different choices. They have family members who made different
choices. Few Americans have lived as a pampered, royal elite totally
divorced from daily life in America. Susan Rice, like her boss, would
end up under a bridge if not for the government. She is the ruling class
and the ruling class is her.

*President Obama did this to himself (and to Bergdahl). This beautifully
educated man, who never tires of letting us know how much smarter he is
than the rest of us, never stopped to consider that our troops and their
families might have been offended by their commander-in-chief staging a
love-fest at the White House to celebrate trading five top terrorists
for one deserter and featuring not the families of those soldiers (at
least six of them) who died in the efforts to find and free Bergdahl,
but, instead, giving a starring role on the international stage to Pa
Taliban, parent of a deserter and a creature of dubious sympathies (that
beard on pops ain’t a tribute to ZZ Top). How do you say “outrageous
insult to our vets” in Pashto?*

This is the result of foreign rule. America has been colonized by these
weird pod people who look like us, make noises that sound familiar, but
otherwise they are nothing like us. America is ruled by foreigners. They
live in the clouds and look down upon the dirt people, like ants. To the
dirt people looking up, the cloud people are strange, otherworldly
creatures with no connection to the earth.
