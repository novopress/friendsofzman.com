The defining feature of this age is the never-ending crisis, always
surrounding the latest name for the Devil. Everything about politics
surrounds the current panic over Trump, Putin, white supremacy, and so
on. These are just names for Old Scratch and the people going on about
it are in a panic. It is not just that the Devil is out there, but that
we must act now to prevent some terrible thing he is doing.

The theater of American democracy is always the same. The people we call
the left are always in a panic about the Devil or a potential victim of
the Devil. The point of their panic is to generate a sense of urgency to
do something about the Devil or about the alleged victim of the Devil.
Sometimes, it is a combination where the agent of the Devil must be
stopped in order to save his victim.

Trump has been useful for the regime because he is the Devil, but not an
abstract version like climate change or a foreigner like Putin. It is
much more difficult to get people excited by a distant threat or one
that is hard to explain. Trump is right here, walking among us. For the
people we call the left, the last decade has been defined by the great
struggle against the orange demon and his minions.

When Trump is gone, they will have a huge hole in their lives, but they
will find a replacement as the center of American identity is this
concept. What it means to be an American is the crisis of Old Scratch.
To be an American means moving from cause to cause, always the same
cause though. It is the crisis of what to do right now about Old Scratch
and his evil designs on our democracy.
