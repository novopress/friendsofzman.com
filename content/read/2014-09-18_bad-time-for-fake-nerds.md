Looks like one of <a
href="http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/18/why-is-wikipedia-deleting-all-references-to-neil-tysons-fabrication/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their icons</a> is a serial
fabulist:

*Religious fanatics have an odd habit of overreacting when people have
the audacity to question their fanaticism. In Iraq, radical Islamic
jihadists are systemically murdering and beheading Christians, Jews, and
even Muslims who do not pledge fealty to ISIS’s religious tenets.
Hundreds of years ago, church authorities and Aristotelian acolytes
imprisoned Galileo for having the audacity to reject geocentrism in
favor of heliocentrism. The bible recounts how Christians were
persecuted and stoned, and Jesus himself was crucified for contradicting
the religious dogma of the day.*

*You will bow to the religious zealots, or you will pay the price.*

*Which brings us to l’affaire de Tyson. Neil Tyson, a prominent
popularizer of science (he even has his own
<a href="http://www.cosmosontv.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">television show</a>) was recently found to have
repeatedly fabricated multiple quotes over several years. The
fabrications were not a one-off thing. They were deliberate and
calculated, crafted with one goal in mind: to elevate Tyson, and by
extension his audience, at the expense of know-nothing, knuckle-dragging
nutjobs who hate science. Tyson targeted journalists, members of
Congress, even former President George W. Bush. And what was their
crime? They were guilty of rejecting science, according to Tyson.*

*There’s only one problem. None of the straw man quotes that Tyson uses
to tear them down are real. The quote about the numerically illiterate
newspaper headline? Fabricated. The quote about a member of Congress who
said he had changed his views 360 degrees? It doesn’t exist. That time a
U.S. president said “Our God is the God who named the stars” as a way of
dividing Judeo-Christian beliefs from Islamic beliefs? It never
happened.*

This is a common problem on the Left. No one challenges them so they
start making stuff up. Celebrity scientists are a lot like celebrity
chefs. They are better at being celebrities than being scientists. They
start getting sloppy and before long they are making claims that are
ridiculous. It’s why a lot of writers never read the comments of their
own stories. They fear they will start writing to please their admirers.

Tyson does not seem like an evil person. He is a bright guy by
conventional standards, but one always has to wonder about the elephant
in the room. His scientific work is meager and ended more than 20 years
ago. He made his name and career as a presenter, PR man and popularizer
of science. Nothing wrong with any of it, but he probably should not be
passing himself off as a scientist these days.

He is the John Stuart of science. Stuart does comedy, but he is not a
comic. He is a preacher, telling the faithful the good news every night.
He uses comedy as a tool and a shield. Tyson has the same act, except he
uses science instead of comedy. Instead of mocking the benighted with
comedy, Tyson tells the chosen that science proves their deepest
beliefs. In another age, science would be replaced by the gods and Tyson
would be dressed as a shaman.
