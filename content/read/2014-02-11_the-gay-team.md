rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is hilarious</a>. It has
long been assumed that Manti Te’o is gay. The reason is pretty simple.
If you are a world famous football player on a college campus, you can
get all the girls you want. These days, even loser males get laid. The
fact that Te’o preferred an imaginary woman over the real women all
around him leads to the obvious conclusion. I don’t recall anyone
offering up proof, but that’s the argument. The fact that the gay guy’s
agent is running with it and saying his client would fit right in is too
funny.

*“I think the Chargers would be a great fit for \[Sam\], especially
considering the way that they handled the Manti Te’o issue,” Barkett
said Monday in a phone interview with the U-T. “It seemed to blow over
very easily once the first game had happened. I think that’d be a great
spot for \[Sam\] to land. And he’d be close to us.”*

*Te’o, who started 13 games this past season despite a persistent foot
injury, repeatedly said that his Chargers teammates did not address the
hoax with him.*

I think this will be interesting to watch. The culture warriors have not
had much success destroying the play on the field of the big sports. The
best they have done thus far is attack the youth leagues, but the pros
have been immune. The need to win and keep an audience is too powerful
so far. As a result, football is bloodless in its treatment of talent.
If you’re good you get paid. If you are trouble you get cut loose.

*“He definitely will be addressing the media. We’re just trying to
figure out what the best forum is for doing that.”*

*Sam, an All-America defensive lineman, led the SEC with 11.5 sacks and
19 tackles for loss last season, helping Missouri reach the SEC
championship game.*

*Many draft projections see Sam as a middle-round pick, with some saying
he could go as high as the third round with a possible position switch
to outside linebacker. Sam is rated the No. 12 outside pass-rusher in
the draft by ESPN Scouts Inc.*

It remains to be seen how long ESPN can keep the story alive. They have
a weird fascination with homosexual men that even out-weirds the
NYTimes. Sports fans are a weird bunch, in that they will tolerate
anything from players, as long as they help the team win, so the gay
stuff will not matter to them probably. On the other hand, sports fans
can easily abandon the sports media, if the sports media embraces this
sort of degeneracy. ESPN better be careful with the gay agenda stuff.
