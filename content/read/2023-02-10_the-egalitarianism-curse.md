It is impossible to overstate the impact that the concept of equality
has had on the Western world, especially in the last century. In the
fullness of time, the American experiment may be recast as the radical
egalitarian experiment. Like the Covid virus, it escaped the lab and
spread around the world. It also has had its greatest impact on the
West, which may not survive it.

It is tempting to lay the blame at the feet of Jesus. After all, the
great preachers of egalitarianism start with the idea of spiritual or
moral equality, even if they explicitly hate the baby Jesus. If all men
are equal in the eyes of God, then it must follow that all men should be
equal in the eyes of one another. Since they are clearly not equal in
reality, there must be something wrong with human society.

This is not true, of course. One does not logically follow the other,
but the hallmark of Western thought since the late Middle Ages is the
error of assuming that observations about nature or nature’s god lead to
rules about human behavior. For most of Church history this was
understood, but then philosophers took over from theologians and the
virus of egalitarianism escaped the lab.

In our time, egalitarianism has worked like an acid, dissolving all of
the organic institutions of society. The churches are overrun by
degenerates. Civic organizations are either crippled by laws requiring
the inclusion of everyone or they have been transformed into weapons in
service to egalitarian ideals. Political opposition has been made into
an enabling operation that confirms the prevailing orthodoxy.

That means any genuine opposition to the prevailing order starts with a
rejection of the universal equality of man business. Whether one looks
to Scripture, biology or some ideological or theological movement, the
only real opposition to the prevailing orthodoxy starts with the
acceptance of human diversity. People are not equal and therefore groups
of people can never be equal to other groups of people.
