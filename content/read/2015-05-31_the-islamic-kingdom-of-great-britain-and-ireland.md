According to a new study, the <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Church of England is heading for the
dustbin of history</a>, while British Islam is on the upswing.

*The Church of England has suffered a dramatic slump in its followers,
shocking new figures show.*

*Between 2012 and 2014, the proportion of Britons identifying themselves
as C of E or Anglican dropped from 21 per cent to 17 per cent – a fall
of about 1.7 million people.*

*Over the same period, the number of Muslims in Britain grew by nearly
one million, according to a survey by the respected NatCen Social
Research Institute.*

*Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey warned last night that
unless urgent action was taken, the Church was just ‘one generation away
from extinction’.*

*The number of Anglicans in Britain has dropped from about 10.3 million
to 8.6 million, and will raise fresh fears over the future of the Church
of England, which has been in decline since the 1960s.*

Of course, those numbers of Anglicans is <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/church-attendance-propped-immigrants-study"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">boosted by imports from the old
empire</a>. Africans and Arabs are surely boosting those figures. How
many natives attend services even occasionally is unknown to me. The
overall weekly attendance rate of Christians in England is 12%. My bet
it the number of self-identified Christians who bother attending
services is less than 20%.

*Alarmingly for Church leaders, the worst losses have come over the past
decade, with about 4.5 million fewer people affiliating themselves to
the C of E or Anglicanism between 2004 and 2014. In contrast, those who
describe themselves as Muslim have jumped from 3.2 per cent of the
population – equivalent to 1.5 million – in 2012 to 4.7 per cent or 2.4
million in 2014. The only Christian denomination that has remained
relatively stable between the 1980s and today is Catholicism – numbers
have dipped slightly from ten per cent to eight per cent.*

*Mr Brierley said the Roman Catholic Church had benefited from the
influx of immigrants in recent years, particularly those from Eastern
Europe. He added: ‘It is not just Poles. Many others are joining the
Church when they come here, from Filipinos to Portuguese. There are
seven different Catholic churches just for Croatians in London.’*

*A category called ‘Other Christian’ has also remained steady, boosted
by the rise of largely black congregations attending Pentecostal
‘mega-churches’.*

*Naomi Jones, of NatCen, said one explanation for the Anglican decline
is that fewer people see Christianity as being an important part of
their British identity.*

I have an old friend who is an Episcopal minister. The Episcopal Church
is suffering from the same problems as the Anglican Church. Women,
homosexuals and Progressives have worked hard to turn the church into an
anti-Christian and anti-Western romper room. They had a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Robinson" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Bishop a few years back who was a proud sodomite</a> and
all-around public nuisance.

Christianity only works when it calls the faithful to live in opposition
to the fallen world. In Europe, nationalism was mixed into the faith so
that each people could make their own claims to be God’s chosen. Even
so, the faithful, including secular leaders, were required to live
according to the tenets of the faith, which demanded the foregoing of
earthly pleasures in order to spend eternity in heaven.

Mainstream Protestant faiths, like the C of E, have thrown in the towel
on all that sacrifice and self-denial stuff. As a result, people stopped
going to services, What would be the point? The Church was supposed to
offer guidance and support in navigating around temptation. If the guy
saying mass cannot control himself and preaches that you follow his
lead, why not stay home and watch TV instead?

That’s all water under the bridge now as Christianity is dead on the
Continent and nearly dead in the Anglosphere. The big news is that Islam
is maybe a decade away from being the biggest religion in England. With
about ten percent of the population being Muslim now, ongoing conversion
and immigration suggest Muslims will be pushing 25% of the population in
a generation.

It’s tempting to think that the rest of the country will rise up in
opposition, but everyone thought something similar when
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelberht_of_Kent"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Æthelberht</a> converted to Christianity
in the 6th century. As Osama bin Laden put it, people see a strong horse
and a weak horse. They will choose the strong horse. Just as
Christianity was the strong horse 1500 years ago, Islam is now the
strong horse in Britain.
