The radio guy [John Batchelor](https://twitter.com/batchelorshow)
followed me on twitter so I followed him back and tuned into his program
a few times. I do not listen to a lot of talk radio and I have only
listed to this program a handful of times. My sense is that he, like
most pundits, is bearish on Donald Trump. I could be wrong here, but my
sense is he is in tune with the conventional wisdom which says Trump has
no chance to beat Clinton. Even though polls look good for Trump, the
feeling is the deck is stacked against him.

One reason I think the conventional wisdom is wrong is they keep
referring to the Red State/Blue State model as if it were written in
stone and handed down by the gods. Batchelor keeps mentioning it in his
analysis. It is a very weird thing about the modern age, but
people struggle to remember anything past a decade or so. It is as if
the present were permanent, never having changed and never changing. I
am not *that* old and I remember when elections were nothing like the
Red State/Blue State model.

The other odd thing, something that you see on the Left all the time, is
the absolute belief that the future is now. Progressives have been
dreaming of the demographic paradise when America is majority-minority
for so long, they seem to think it has happened. Maybe it is just
honkyphobia, but they carry on like blacks and Hispanics have a veto
over our elections. America is still roughly 70% white and many
Hispanics prefer to ID as white, when given the choice.

Of course, there’s the elephant in the room. Hillary Clinton is the most
unappealing candidate to lead a party since Mike Dukakis. Frankly, I am
probably being unfair to Dukakis, who was honest, but cursed with a dull
personality. Hillary is a shrieking harpy, who makes your skin crawl. If
you had her pop out of a closet in a haunted house, the authorities
would shut it down for public safety reasons. To normal men, testicular
cancer is more appealing than Clinton.

The bigger issue is the math problem. Here’s the back of the envelope
demographic breakdown of the 2012 vote:

<table width="593">

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;" width="281"><strong>Demographic

I’m pulling this from
<a href="http://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">census data</a> and there are some
rounding issues, but it is a good starting point when looking at this
coming election. For starters, blacks came out in historic numbers, for
obvious reasons. That’s not happening in 2016. Second, whites never
warmed to Mittens. The white vote was down 2% from 2008 and that was
down significantly from 2004. While Obama struggled with honkies, enough
stayed home to allow the elevated black vote to carry him to victory.

Using current polling, we have a Clinton model like this:

<table width="593">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;" width="281"><strong>Demographic
Group</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;" width="104"><strong>% of
Vote</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"
width="104"><strong>Clinton Share</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;" width="104"><strong>Vote
Share</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">The Blue-Eyed Devil</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">74.70%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">32.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">23.90%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">The Sacred People</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">12.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">99.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">11.88%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">The New Sacred People</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">9.40%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">75.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">7.05%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">Minorities That Get Into Stanford</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">3.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">100.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">3.00%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Totals</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">99.10%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>45.83%</strong></td>
</tr>

What I have done here is assume a slight uptick in the white vote, based
on history and what we are seeing in the primaries. I am assuming the
black vote returns to normal and I am giving the Hispanics a bit of
boost, even though the data does not suggest it. Keep in mind that the
white vote was 77% in 2004. I could be understating it here, but I am
trying to be conservative and not sound like a Trump cheerleader. Even
so, Hillary Clinton is looking at a ceiling of 46%, which matches up
pretty well with the polling so far.

To make matters worse, recent polling has shown Trump doing much better
with blacks than the typical Republican. He is in the 10% range which is
unheard of and suggests the black vote will be very depressed.
Similarly, Trump is polling better than Romney with Hispanics. Put
another way, the model in that graphic is the rosy scenario for Clinton
at the moment. Unless things change, she could be facing a Hubert
Humphey sized defeat.

That does not mean Trump is a lock. He has a number of hurdles to
overcome before people see him as a safe and plausible choice for
President. There is also the Traitor Party Bill Kristol is trying to run
as a straw to siphon votes from Trump. Even that nitwit Gary Johnson
could become a home for the \#nevertrump loons. These people are lackeys
of the Custodial State and will do everything to help Clinton, someone
they see as one of their own.

Even with all that, the math is terrible for Clinton. Counting on a
straw in a presidential race is the very definition of desperation.
[John Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Anderson) was not
able to stop Reagan and
[Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace) could not stop
Nixon. A candidate has to offer something more than disdain and a
lecture. The Democrats are now the anti-white party and the anti-male
party. In a country that is 70% white and 50% male, which is going to be
a losing hand in the long run. Having a shriveled hag as your candidate
makes the task impossible.
