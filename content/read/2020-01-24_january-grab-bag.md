Because I’m so pressed for time these days, back during the holidays I
sat down and wrote out a podcast schedule for the month. I figured
impeachment would be a hot topic this week, so I assumed I’d have plenty
of impeachment related news items to talk about this week. Instead,
everything about this farce is a snoozer. Even the lefty news outlets
are struggling to pretend they are enjoying it. Adam Schiff’s big show
is a good reason why the Finns have the word
[myötähäpeä](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/my%C3%B6t%C3%A4h%C3%A4pe%C3%A4).

The only angle to this thing of any interest to me is the bizarre
circling back to the Russian collusion hoax. I think most of us thought
the fakers knew the story was fake, but they were hoping to fool people
with it. That may be true with some of them, but it seems clear that
people like Adam Schiff really do believe this stuff. He thinks the
Cossacks are warming up, waiting for Trump to give the signal. He is a
deranged lunatic, who belongs in an asylum.

A long time ago I tried to think of a metric one could use to measure
the general lunacy of the ruling class of a society. For instance,
measure the distance between official truths from actual truths. The
greater the distance, the nuttier the people in charge of the society.
Think about some of the things that come out of North Korea about the
Dear Leader or whatever they are calling the guy now. Compare that to
what the Swiss say about their president, for example.

Another possible measure is the amount of propaganda expelled by the
ruling class either in volume or intensity. The more they harangue their
subjects, the greater the distance between them and reality. The trouble
with this approach is we are swimming in made-up nonsense. Spend a
little time watching television. The North Koreans install loudspeakers
in the town square to blast propaganda. Americans install flat screens
in their homes to receive the official truth.

Conceptually, it works, but measuring official insanity is probably best
left to general instinct, rather than some money ball approach. Five
minutes watching the bug-eyed lunatic on the Senate floor is all you
need to know about a significant portion of the American political
class. Further, the tolerance of a mentally unstable person in the
Congress, tells us the whole lot are beyond saving. In Washington, a
kook like Adam Schiff is not out of the ordinary. He is the norm.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
