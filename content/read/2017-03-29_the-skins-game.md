There’s a popular quote from Hemingway’s *The Sun Also Rises,* where one
character asks another character how he went bankrupt. The response is
“Gradually and then suddenly.” It’s funny because it is true. The great
upheavals in human affairs seldom happen without warning. They are
always part of a long process that was plain to see, but people
preferred not to notice it so it rolled along until a crash or
revolution.

A generation or two from now, people will look back at America and
wonder how racial conflict broke out after what many thought were years
of social progress. After all, the good whites had atoned for all the
bad things done by bad whites. In reality, those years of “progress”
were just accumulating bad habits and bad decisions, disguising an
underlying rot. American society is headed for a bad place and <a

Los Angeles has a form of misery sharing in their school system. Since
people vote with their feet, they naturally tend toward
self-segregation. This means the schools tend to reflect this as kids go
to the schools closest to where they live. To remedy this, the good
schools are punished as a way to “even the playing field.” It’s an
insane effort to implement the Kurt Vonnegut story <a

A look at <a
href="http://www.greatschools.org/california/north-hollywood/2341-Walter-Reed-Middle-School/"
target="_blank">the makeup of this particular school</a> offers a
glimpse of the future. The first thing you see is the school is 47%
Hispanic, which in Los Angeles is going to mean Mexican, with a sizable
chunk of Central Americans. It is roughly 30% white, 11% Asian and 7%
black. The test scores, across all races, are above average for the
city. This means the school can have a decent basketball team, but still
do well in the math bowl.

The North Hollywood area is not a slum, but it is slightly downscale.
The demographics, as of 2000, were Hispanics 57.7%, whites 27%, Asians
5.7%, blacks 5.6%, and others at 4%. Gentrification is underway so those
numbers will begin to change as the renters are priced out of the
market. In other words, the local schools will either have to import
diversity or build private schools. Otherwise, they will be de-funded by
the city.

The sound you hear is the ratchet clicking. As these sorts of incidents
happen, everyone begins to think in terms of race. The honkies can
accept writing checks to the blacks, maybe, but the Hispanics? The
Asians, of course, see no reason for cutting checks to anyone. The
Hispanics are in a bind as they try to work out whether it is better to
be on Team Honky or Team Black, but they are not going to cut checks to
the blacks.

The Cloud People imagine a world built like a sports league. The rich
successful teams write checks to the poor, unsuccessful teams. That
works in baseball as the Yankees and Red Sox need opponents for their
games, so they agree to pay Tampa to field a team. In real life, people
don’t think that way. The Asians are never going to think they need a
really good hoops team, so they will hate writing checks to Team Black.

As the racial spoils system settles into society, new types of response
develop for each group to maximize their slice of the pie. One example
is gentrification. This is where rich white liberals buy up parts of the
ghetto and then drive the hues away with high rents and heavy policing.
This way they can have nice urban playgrounds for their kids to enjoy
the cosmopolitan lifestyle, without being stabbed by a junkie.

What we have going on is a racial undertow, where the current at the top
appears to be flowing in, but underneath, a stronger current is flowing
out. In a society with one defined minority group, the majority will go
along with helping the minority. When you have nothing but minority
groups, which is where America is headed and where LA is now, you end up
with the skins game and that is always a zero sum game with winners and
losers.

A popular quote in the hate-think community is from <a
href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-singapore-s-lee-kuan-yew-it-s-stupid-to-be-afraid-a-369128.html"
target="_blank">this interview with the Lee Kuan Yew</a>. “In
multiracial societies, you don’t vote in accordance with your economic
interests and social interests, you vote in accordance with race and
religion.” That is the example of history and it is why Singapore has
always been an authoritarian society. It is the only way to keep peace.
Men with guns have to supervise the skins game.

It is why humans across the globe instinctively reject multiculturalism
and diversity. Even the lunatics preaching this nonsense avoid diversity
and multiculturalism. They always live in rich white neighborhoods and
send their kids to private schools. They like diversity and
multiculturalism from a safe distance. Humans know another thing that is
popular in the hate-think community. That is, Diversity + Proximity =
Violence.
