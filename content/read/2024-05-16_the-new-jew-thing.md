The one thing the critics of Elon Musk have right is that after his
takeover of Twitter, now stupidly called X, the amount of anti-Jewish
material has increased. Not all of it should be called antisemitic, as
much of it is anti-Israel and anti-Zionist, but the antisemites have
been given far more room to operate. Musk restored the man who has to be
the current frontrunner for the Jerusalem Post’s
<a href="https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-781331"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">antisemite</a> of the year award, Nick
Fuentes, to the platform recently, which has had the predictable
results.

No doubt, Elon Musk simply thinks these things will sort themselves over
time and there is no reason to stifle speech in the name of guarding the
feelings of those who are always on alert for a discouraging word, but
it is also true that it has resulted in far more genuinely antisemitic
content on the platform. The question is whether this is just a burst of
energy due to newfound freedom or does it reflect a change in attitude
regarding Jews and their place in American society.

The place to start is this
<a href="https://twitter.com/aaron_renn/status/1790921538658546036"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by someone calling himself Will
Chamberlain and the response from someone calling himself Aaron Renn.
The former is a Jewish political activist, and the latter is a
Protestant involved in religious activism. The topic of the exchange is
something the great John Derbyshire observed a million years ago when he
wrote a <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-marx-of-the-anti-semites/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">review</a> of Kevin MacDonald’s infamous
book. Derb introduced the idea of the “Jew Thing”, which afflicts
right-wing people.

It is true that for some reason a certain segment of the right is
susceptible to the Jew Thing and when exposed to it they go crazy with
it. For most it is a short fever that eventually breaks leaving them
with an additional set of tools to help understand what is happening in
the world. For others it becomes a lifelong obsession that takes over
their life in the same way that drug dependency can take over a life.
They wake up thinking about Jews and go to bed thinking about Jews.

That may be what is happening with the volume of anti-Jewish material we
see on Twitter, now stupidly called X. This subculture has some room to
breathe on a big public platform, so it is party time. This happened in
the olden times when social media was called Usenet and there was little
moderation. In fact, this subculture was a pioneer in building online
communities. Don Black built one of the first genuine
<a href="https://www.stormfront.org/forum/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">online communities</a> back in the early 1990’s and it
is still going.

What happened in the old days is self-segregation. People with narrow
interests, built communities around those interests because they did not
want to interact with people who did not share their interests. It also
meant that people dedicated to opposing certain topics, built walls and
fences around their communities to keep out the people they claimed to
oppose. That is probably what will happen with Twitter, now stupidly
called X, once the harpies discover the block option.

There is another option. One obvious difference between this wave of the
Jew Thing and prior waves is this one is much younger and simplistic. In
the old days, people afflicted with the Jew Thing would spend much of
their time working out the details of the Jew Thing, often by reading
books written by fellow sufferers or by interacting inside those narrow
online communities. They spent only a small portion of their time
proselytizing to the masses about the Jew Thing.

This new wave is the opposite. It is not an intellectual movement. These
are not people reading and discussing Kevin MacDonald. They are not
writing long rebuttals to Nathan Cofnas, as they have never heard of
him. Instead, they spend their time posting the early life of everyone
they think may be Jewish in the timeline of everyone they think needs to
hear the news about the Jew Thing. In other words, this wave may not be
bigger, but it may be much louder.

Again, most people who catch the Jew Thing recover and simply come away
with an understanding of how group loyalty works inside a pluralistic
society. In a way, the Jew Thing is like Covid, in that those who
recover, and most do, come away knowing that it will not kill you but
the people warning about it certainly will, so it is best to be on your
guard at all times. This may be what happens with the people currently
caught up in the current epidemic of the Jew Thing.

Of course, this could be another symptom of late phase empire. The most
famous outbreak of the Jew Thing was in the last century when the old
imperial order in Europe collapsed in the wake of the Great War. Once
the old mental frameworks collapsed, people could look around and see
things they never saw in the past. This stunning emergence of reality
and the chaos brought about by the collapse of the old order led people
to embrace new narratives.

That could be what is happening now. The American empire is in decline
and people feel that things are no longer in good order. Young people,
as is always the case in societal decline, feel the tremors of collapse
first. That could explain why this new epidemic of the Jew Thing is
hitting the Zoomers. The world is not as they were trained up to expect
and this disconfirmation is resulting in a disassociation with the old
ways, opening the mind to the Jew Thing as an alternative framework.

Another thing that supports that last possibility is that the regime
seems to be struggling to contain this outbreak. In the past, they would
have pressured Musk into cracking down on this material and we would
have seen a coordinated campaign to purge the afflicted from the public
square. The ADL forced Musk to visit the pile of shoes, but it did not
take, which suggests something has changed. Maybe this epidemic is more
than just a replay of the past and something new is happening.
