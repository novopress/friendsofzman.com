It’s increasingly difficult to be a normal man and engage in the general
culture. One reason is the people in the content business, especially
the news business, seem like they are from another planet. They say
things that are so at odds with daily reality you wonder if they ever go
outside. Of course, most of what they write and say is propaganda. They
don’t think of it that way. They are just enthusiastically repeating the
articles of faith of their class. The news is just a hallelujah chorus
for the cult of modern liberalism.

A good example is the brouhaha over the Miami Dolphins drama. The sports
press, despite not knowing any details, has crafted this elaborate
narrative into which they are going to force the participants. The
“culture in the locker room” is one element. All of those terrible alpha
males, you see. Of course, the white guy is pure evil because he used
the magic word, despite doing in front of black guys who were laughing
and egging him on while everyone is partying. <a

no one on his team coming to his defense</a>.

One reason for this weird disconnect is that the sporting press is
dominated by beta males who find traditional male behavior threatening
and distasteful. There’s a class element too. Football players may have
gone to college, but football is decidedly working class. You don’t
excel in the sport without being a physically tough man. To be a
physically tough man means rejecting a central part of modern liberal
culture. Like cops, football players accept the human condition at face
value, which means accepting the biological diversity.

Another reason for this is Progressive culture is feminine. Women can be
ruthless, but they don’t have the same hierarchical view of social
organization as males. Men compete to establish the pecking order in the
group. Women compete for the attention of males. That’s how the general
culture operates now. George Bush once said, something along the lines
that if one person hurts, government must act. That’s the general view
of the over class. It is not winners and losers, it is just losers. As
long as there are losers, no one can be a winner.

That’s why sports reporting is so weird. Normal men look at this story
and just assume the one guys is a pussy and the other guys are assholes.
Every normal man knows the world is divided into predators, victims and
the men who make the world run. At the fringes, like a locker-room or a
prison, the predators attack the weak.  So many of the people in the
sports media grew up as victims of the playground bullies, they can’t
understand what they are covering.
