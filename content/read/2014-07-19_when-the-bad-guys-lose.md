Normal people like it when the good guys win. Our progressive overlords
and their toadies root for the bad guys, so of course it is always good
when the bad guys lose as that harms the people in charge. it is one of
the rare examples of where the friend of your enemy is you enemy working
out to be right. What’s bad for our rulers is good for the rest of us.

bad guy *really* lost.

*A Florida dad who told police he walked in on a man sexually abusing
his child, left the suspect motionless and bleeding Friday morning on
the living room floor, police said.*

*[The Daytona Beach
News-Journal](http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20140718/news/140719489?tc=ar)
reported that the suspect was found at the Daytona Beach home at about 1
a.m. Friday. The paper, citing the arrest report, said Raymond Frolander
was found with several knots on his face and bleeding from the mouth.*

*The 35-year-old father and his son were not identified, but the father
reportedly walked in on Frolander sexually battering his son.*

*The paper obtained the 911 call and reported that the dad told the
dispatcher, “I just walked in a grown man molesting…and I got him in a
bloody puddle for you, officer.”*

*He told police that he didn’t use any weapons in the beating, nor did
he ask the suspect any questions.*

*“He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you,” the dad reportedly
told police.*
