target="_blank">Steve Sailer has a fantastic breakdown</a> of <a
href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/segregation-now/359813/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> in the
Atlantic. The article is tedious, but Steve’s deconstruction is well
worth the time it takes to read it. It is an example of why I rarely
read anything written by women. Women want to share experiences and talk
about them. Men want to see facts and state opinions. That does not mean
all male writers are cold-blooded logic machines. It’s that many are
willing to write about facts, rather than their feelings about the
facts.

This line in the Atlantic post is interesting.
<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-style: italic;">“…
In recent years, a new term, apartheid schools—meaning schools whose
white population is 1 percent or less, schools like Central—has entered
the scholarly lexicon. While most of these schools are in the Northeast
and Midwest, some 12 percent of black students in the South now attend
such schools ….”
</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;">Northern
whites will treat blacks as equals just as long as they don;’t have to
live near them remains a stubborn reality.</span>

But let’s back up here a second. The author, a black woman and is
writing for a northern publication about “resegregation” in the South.
Then she fully admits that the north is vastly more segregated than the
South. If I did not know better, I’d assume this is a very clever prank
by someone trying to illustrate the blinkered idiocy of northern white
liberals. Maybe it is, but the lack of self-awareness with the sorts of
people who now control publications the Atlantic cannot be overlooked.

<a href="http://nikolehannahjones.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">According to the author’s resume</a>, she lives in
Brooklyn, a place that is actively driving out black people so upper
middle-class whites can live in trendy neighborhoods. She grew up in
Iowa, went to Notre Dame and then went to UNC for a masters. Her choice
of majors tells us she grew up middle-class or better. Her knowledge of
the South and experience with the underclass can probably be written on
a napkin.

Outsiders often make the best observers as they lack the emotional
blinkers of insiders, so her observations could worthwhile. As Steve
illustrates, what we’re getting here is the same old liberal platitudes
about race, dressed up with some statistics and decorative personal
stories. In other words, the story was written before she started
gathering personal accounts, anecdotes and statistics.

The point is not to inform, but to confirm. Nikole Hannah-Jones is
playing the same side of the street as <span class="st">Ta-Nehisi
Coates. This is a performance piece intended to flatter the all white
northern liberal readership of The Atlantic. The Jews running it are
good at this game, which is why they run the media. Town meetings in
Iceland have more diversity than the readership of the Atlantic. It is
also culturally monolithic. Ms. Jones seems to have figured this out and
parlayed that into a nice payday.</span>
