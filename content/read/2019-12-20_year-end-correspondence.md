This will be the last show of the year. This is one of the slowest times
of the year for site traffic and show listening. Unlike the filthy
degenerates on the other side, our people are out and about with family
and friends this time of year. It’s also a good time for me to do some
hardware upgrades I’ve been planning. The day job is a bit slower this
time of year, so I take the time to clean up lingering items on the
list. Normal production will resume after the New Year.

I’m taking the opportunity to knock one thing off the list and that is
to catch up on all outstanding correspondence. All the stuff I wanted to
use in the show has been used and I only have a few items left in the
inbox. One of the things on my next year list is to come up with a
better system for handling correspondence. I let this stuff build up and
then it is a gargantuan task. I wind up responding to people weeks and
maybe months after they sent their initial e-mail. I need a better
system.

This is also the time of year when people think about personal goals and
projects for the coming year. I’m no different. I’m not into
resolutions, but I use this time of year to think about what I can do to
make the coming year a little better. In the past, this has been when I
have plotted career changes and moving. This year I will be thinking
about the latter, as my time here in Lagos is coming to a close. I’m not
sure where I will be heading, but I will be looking for less colorful
environs.

That is, of course, something we have to consider when moving. It’s not
just the diversity at the moment, but the possibility of diversity in
the future. These days, whole towns are destroyed by developers,
building garbage housing and then adding “affordable housing” to please
the local pols. Your nice little town can quickly become a sterile
development full of strangers, with a dollop of diversity. All of us are
being forced to plan defensively in our careers and our living spaces.

Of course, if any of the anti-white bigots on stage last night at the
Democrat debate win in 2020, there will be no place to hide. As we’re
seeing in Virginia, the pogroms will begin as soon as they are in
office. I had originally thought about moving back to Virginia, but the
madness going on there now eliminates the Old Dominion from my list of
places to live. The way things are headed, I’m going to end up as
Jeremiah Johnson, living up above the tree line to avoid the madness.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
