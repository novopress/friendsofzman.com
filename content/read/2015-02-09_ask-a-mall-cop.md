I read National Review On-Line every day for the same reason I read the
NYTimes or the WaPo. It’s not that I share the outlook, it’s that I like
to know what they are planning to do to me. Plus, there’s some
entertainment value. <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/398177/lets-be-honest-about-ukraine-tom-rogan"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is a good example</a>. The piece
itself is the same swill they slop the warmongering hogs with on every
other foreign policy issue. The war party has worn out their welcome
with me. That’s not the important bit. What I find hilarious is the
author of the piece.

National Review works closely with Fox News and Sky News. You see the
same people turning up on all three places. The Weekly Standard also
shares resources with these three, but not as much as National Review.
Tom Rogan is the new toy on Fox and NRO prattling on about foreign
policy issues. Fox loves using guys with British accents to play the
role of foreign policy expert. Roger Ailes must be a James Bond fan.
Unfamiliar with Rogan, I looked him up and found

The red part is what caught my attention. I was expecting, given his
age, to see a bunch of college stuff. For paid work, I expected a stint
at some ministry or possibly the UN. In other words I figured he was a
hack in some foreign policy shop who decided to try his hand at TV.
Maybe he married someone in the TV business or something, but he had
something on his resume to qualify him to call foreign policy his
specialty. Instead, he was essentially a mall cop.

This is why a guy like Brian Williams goes so long telling whoppers. In
world where everyone is pretending to be something they are not, a world
where low IQ blockheads with the right look are paraded on TV as
experts, why not tell whoppers? It’s just a big show anyway. As long as
a guy like Rogan does not start talking about how Blofeld is behind the
Ukraine crisis, why not let the mall cop be the foreign policy guy?
