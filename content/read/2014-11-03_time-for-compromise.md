You hate to admired the Left’s ability to rationalize disconfirmation.
Unlike a religious movement, it has the ability to absorb defeats and
turn them into building blocks for future assaults on their enemies. The
Romans had a similar quality. Even after Cannae, the Romans were not
defeated. The American Left is similar. No amount of evidence will break
the spirit of the believers.

Facing a bad night this Tuesday, Joe Biden is already saying the results
will <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">force the other side to yield</a>.

*Vice President Joe Biden says he expects congressional Republicans to
work to “get things done” if they win control of the Senate — and he
notes the White House is prepared to give a little.*

*In an interview with CNN released on Monday, Biden said that while he
still expects the Democrats to retain Senate control, he believes a
Republican-controlled Senate will move beyond obstructionism.*

*“\[G\]oing into 2016, the Republicans have to make a decision whether
they’re in control or not in control,” the vice president told Gloria
Borger. “Are they going to begin to allow things to happen? Or are they
going to continue to be obstructionists? And I think they’re going to
choose to get things done.”*

It really is amazing to watch. The people could rise up, drag Obama from
the White House and hang him from a lamp post and the Left would respond
by saying it is proof the mob has to compromise. When the shoe was on
the other foot, the Left suggested that the remaining Republicans commit
suicide, right after murdering their families. After all, the people had
spoke and the Left was the winner.

It is why the GOP will do exactly that, compromise. Many in the GOP
admire the tenacity and togetherness of the Left. Time and circumstance
keep them on the outside, but they wish they could be in the club.
Middlebrow stiffs like John Boehner look at the Left in the same way the
shopkeeper looks at the aristocrat. That’s the bait. Obama and Biden
will sweet talk Boehner and McConnell into thinking this time they will
get invited to the party, right after they sign off on whatever it is
the Left wants.

When all hell breaks lose after the grand compromise, the rubes like
Boehner will be shocked to find out that their new friends are laughing
at them behind their back on the pages of the Washington Post and New
York Times. Newt Gingrich was famous for falling into this trap. The
pudgy dork with bad hair and the weird name always wanted to hang out
with the cool kids. That was his weakness. That and donuts.
