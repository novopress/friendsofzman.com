**Note:** I will be on with Patrick Casey tonight at 7:00 PM. The topics
will be 1) the importance of the kids staying off my lawn, b) why my
generation’s music is better than the current crap and iii) why we used
to wear an onion on our belt. You can click
<a href="https://dlive.tv/PatrickCasey" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this link</a> to listen, but you need an account to ask
questions in the chat.

The last segment of the show this week is mostly about [this
clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrNKoTF5i2E) featuring Andrew
Sullivan and Christopher Caldwell. Someone on Gab sent it to me,
suggesting they are starting to stumble into the Cloud people – Dirt
People thing. Listening to the two of them, I felt like I was
eavesdropping on a conversation among aliens. I was struck by their
solipsism and lack of imagination. They both know there are people and
societies outside their world, but they do not think too hard about
them.

What really got me was how the two of them agreed that they are part of
the global economy, while the rubes out in flyover country are not. It
is fair to say that neither of them is part of the economy at all.
Writing essays for one another is economic activity of a sort, but only
at the furthest edge of the leisure end. The guy riding a leaf blower
around an office park is involved in the global economy. He is from
another country and his tools are sourced from around the world.

This gets to the heart of the current troubles. The ruling class is
stuffed to the gills with provincial mediocrities who think they are
worldly sophisticates. When our betters go abroad, they go to places
that are filled with the exact same people they experience in
Washington, New York, or any of the elite enclaves. Look around at where
these people live and work and it is always the same. Their world is an
extended version of the college campus, a shelter from the reality of
the rest of us.

I think this is one aspect of the managerial class that gets missed. One
reason these people assume all people are the same is that in their
world it is true. For the most part, race, sex, ethnicity, even class,
are superficial attributes. That nice African from the sociology
department has a funny accent, but otherwise he is not all that
different from the Jewish guy in the anthropology department or the
white woman from the psychology department with the dream catcher on her
door.

There also seems to be a sense of randomness to their outlook. Hollywood
stars are far Left mostly because they know they got lucky. For them,
life is a lottery, and they got a winning ticket, so they assume this is
how the world works in general. The mediocrities in the managerial class
seem to have adopted the same view. They look around at the sameness
around them, the utter lack of utility, and they think they are the
beneficiaries of good fortune, which they call privilege.

This is not wrong, but it does not work as they imagine. For them, life
was simply a matter of following the clearly written instructions.
Almost all of these people have the same sort of background.
Professional parents, private schools, elite colleges, self-actualizing
career choices. All around them are people who have the same story, so
why is it they get to live relatively easy lives? It must be their
privilege, which they now project onto the world outside their walls.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one

**Promotions:** The good folks at

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
