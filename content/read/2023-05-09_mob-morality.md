A sportsball coach is in the <a
href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/37571594/wvu-reviewing-incident-huggins-uses-anti-gay-slur-air"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">news</a> for having used a taboo word
during an interview with some jock sniffers. The other jock sniffers are
now
<a href="https://twitter.com/GaryParrishCBS/status/1655730534981435393"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">demanding</a> the coach be hurled into
the void so they can get some piety points on Twitter. The coach, of
course, has issued the groveling apology, which will make no difference.
The people howling for blood are not interested in his apology. They
want blood. These cancel campaigns are a form of human sacrifice to
appease the mob.

The thing about these campaigns is they obscure something that no one
bothers to ask and that is who decided that you cannot use certain
words? The coach in this story was responding to a question about fans
throwing rubber marital aids onto the floor during games at Xavier
University. He jokingly referred to them as “Catholic fags” because it
is a nominally Catholic college and the fans of their basketball team
seem to be obsessed with rubber penises.

Now, the word “fag” has always been an expletive. As such it was always
considered rude to use it in public, especially around women and
children. Men, of course, tend to use rough language around one another,
but it used to be the custom to avoid such language in public. Today we
live in an age where men in dresses are allowed to chase children around
the playground, so prohibitions against using rough language in public
seem more than a bit ridiculous.

Obviously, that is not why the mob is after the coach. You see, he
expressed something less than a positive opinion about people attracted
to the same sex. The question that never gets asked is, who decided
this? This taboo is not in the Christian Bible or in the Hebrew Bible,
so this taboo is not from there. We did not have a vote on it, nor has
anyone run for office promising to institute this taboo. What is the
moral authority for demanding that we worship homosexuals?

The same question can be asked for most of the novel taboos. Racism used
to mean a prejudice against someone for their race. Until the middle of
the 20th century, no one cared about racism or used the word in normal
conversation. Making judgments about people based on race, ethnicity,
sex, class, education and so on is what humans naturally do when
evaluating people. All of those, except for the last two, are now
official taboos ruthlessly enforced by the worst people.

None of these modern taboos have a recognizable moral authority. Racism,
which now means white people making informed decisions about nonwhites,
is especially ridiculous, given that the enforcers are almost always
white and living in white nationalist communities. The whiter the
community, the more absurd and infantile their views on race, but the
more certain they are about the alleged racism of their fellow whites
living over the horizon.

What is going on here is a bit of moral base stealing. The people
wagging their bony finger at the fag-bashing coach assume a moral
authority and then proceed to stand on it while lecturing the rest of
us. If you could sit down that jock-sniffing weirdo from CBS Sports to
explain why he thinks what the coach said warrants him being hurled into
the void, he would not be able to do it. All that he knows is he gets
points for being at the front of the mob demanding the blood of the
heretic.

This is why you see no one in the media that is willing or able to ask
any of these people the rather obvious question about these things. Who
decided that it is immoral to hold negative opinions about homosexuals?
It has always been rude to say disparaging things about people when they
are not around to defend themselves, but it has also been rude to pick
your nose in public. Rude and immoral are not the same things, so who
decided to make rudeness taboo?

The same question can be asked about all of our taboos. There is no
moral authority that anyone would recognize. Jesus was fine with
slavery, so it is unlikely that he would be upset about judging people
by race or ethnicity. Jews call themselves the chosen people, which
means the very definition of what it means to be a Jew rests on an
assumed racial superiority over all other humans. If racism is the worst
taboo, why are Jewish people allowed to practice their religion?

Not to put too fine a point on it, but the guy who cooked up the term
“homophobia” was psychologist <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/george-weinberg-dead-coined-homophobia.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">named</a> George Weinberg. He not only
coined the term, but declared that it was immoral to be a homophobe. Who
in the hell was this guy to think he could conjure a new moral code for
the rest of us? That is what he did and lots of other self-important
people joined in on it. Why did all the beautiful people suddenly decide
that this weirdo is allowed to make up new rules?

Of course, we know the answer. The people in charge have cooked up these
novel taboos because their heads are full of nutty ideas about humanity.
They do not make any sense because the underlying ideology makes no
sense. They never think about it very much because their time is filled
with waging their bony fingers at the rest of us so they can get piety
points online. It turns out that the moral authority for this stuff is
just as mysterious to them as it is to the rest of us.

The reason moral authority for this stuff is a mystery is that the
authority is the mindset of the mob. The fundamental morality
underpinning democracy is that fifty percent plus one is what makes
right. Win the mob, or convince yourself that you have won the mob, and
suddenly you are on the side of angels. If the mob can be convinced you
are a heretic, then the mob shows up at your door. The morality of the
mob is as mysterious to the mob as it is to the rest of us.
