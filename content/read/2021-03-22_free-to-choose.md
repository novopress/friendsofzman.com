**Note:** I am posting regularly behind the green door on more casual
topics like movies and personal topics. The latest is
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/299988" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">a review</a> of the 2012 movie Dredd. This week’s
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/a-wilderness-of-lies/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up and somewhat related
to this post.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a modern prison, the prisoners are quickly conditioned to have a
reason for everything when asked by a guard. They are prisoners and they
have no freedom, so they need permission for everything. On the other
hand, prisoners have a lot of time to work the system, so they get good
at the rules. With the help of lawyers on the outside they hold the
prison system to their own rules. As a result, everyone working in the
system knows they need a reason for everything they do.

The prison is the ultimate expression of a world without choice. This is
a thing to keep in mind when looking at what is happening in America. It
is no longer acceptable to say “because I want to” when asked about a
preference or choice. You have to have a reason for your choices. The
sources of authority are the prevailing dogma on human relations or
science, which is just another word for the dogma. Science has become a
deity of sorts for the true believers of the modern age.

One example of how this played out was the homosexual marriage debate.
The people pushing it flipped the debate by demanding to know why
homosexuals could not get marriage licenses. All of a sudden, everyone
was scrambling around for a reason to standby the default position of
humanity. Since the official dogma asserted that anyone opposing the
homosexual agenda was a bigot and therefore dismissed from the debate,
there was no acceptable reason to defend natural reality.

The important part of that debate in regards to the permission society
is how quickly normal people went along with it. Once the Left framed
the issue as a question, normal people scratched their heads searching
for an answer. They just assumed they needed a reason to defend
biological reality. Critically, public opinion was no longer
justification for maintaining normal marriage. A majority preferring to
keep the old ways was not a good reason. Group preference was no longer
acceptable.

Public policy is not the only area where choice is being stripped from
us. In fact, having a preference is immoral. White women can no longer
say they prefer to date white men, for example. That violates the
official dogma. They need to find some other reason to not date outside
their race. Something similar is being pushed with homosexuals and
transvestites. Even the most intimate and personal of choices are
subject to examination and you better have a good reason for them.

What kicked this off, of course, was the war on free association. In the
quest for racial equality, white people were stripped of their freedom
to associate with whom they wanted in daily life. If a white person
chooses not to hire a nonwhite, they know they need to record an
acceptable reason. If asked, they must provide this reason. The same is
true of renting an apartment or asking about the schools. In the
permission state, you are guilty until you provide your permission slip.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrNKoTF5i2E" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this conversation</a> between Christopher Caldwell and
Andrew Sullivan, they discuss why many people oppose what they call
globalism. Caldwell thinks it is because these people are not capable of
competing, while Sullivan assumes these people are ignorant of the
glories of diversity. There is an assumed lack of agency. The
possibility that people simply prefer to live in more traditional
communities is alien to them. There must be some reason that fits within
the prevailing orthodoxy.

The prohibition on personal preference is a paradox of liberal
democracy. In theory, the system is supposed to reflect the accumulated
preferences of the people. That is the point of having an election. The
people vote their choices, and the preference of the majority carries
the day. The people do not need a reason to make their choices, because
in a democracy the will of the people is the finale authority. That is
the point of democracy, but now we are at the exact opposite position.

This is another great parallel between communism and liberal democracy.
In the former, the dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed to
result in the full expression of the public will but ended up with a
dictatorship of a tiny minority. In liberal democracy, the election
process and open debate are supposed to get consensual government, but
in reality, it is something closer to a theocracy. In both cases, the
ruling minority appears to despise those they rule but cloak themselves
in moral authority.

It turns out that preferences and moral authority are conjoined. When
moral authority resides with the people, in their traditions and
customs, they maintain the freedom to choose within the broad outlines
of those customs and traditions. Once moral authority shifts to some
arbitrary ideology, then moral authority shifts to a tiny elite. A
similar process happened with the Catholic Church in the middle ages.
Church dogma replaced tradition and culture as the moral authority of
the people.

That suggests the remedy for liberal democracy is a reformation. In this
context, the reformation was about restoring moral authority to the
people, by rooting their faith in their local customs and traditions.
Lutheranism reflected the nature of the Germanic people, while
Anglicanism reflected the sensibilities of the English. For liberal
democracy, this means restoring national sovereignty, so that the will
of the people can be expressed in politics and public policy.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
