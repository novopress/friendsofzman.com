That’s right, slavery is still happening in America. Guy Gecht, the CEO
of a company called Electronics for Imaging is a slaver. No, he is not
keeping black people on a plantation. He is keeping brown people on a
plantation. Specifically, he is keeping Hindus on his corporate
plantation,
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/23/efi-underpaying-workers/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">at least according to this report</a>.

*Ever heard of Electronics for Imaging? We hadn’t either until this
morning, but it’s apparently a multimillion dollar, multinational,
public corporation based out of Fremont, California. And the United
States Department of Labor just caught EFI red-handed in an
investigation, which found that “about eight employees” were flown in
from India to work 120-hour weeks for $1.21 per hour. EFI apparently
thought it was okay to pay the employees the same wages they’d be paid
in India (in Indian rupees). Here’s the unbelievably crazy sounding
quote EFI gave to <a
href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Fremont-Tech-Company-Paid-Workers-121-An-Hour-US-Dept-of-Labor-280148082.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">NBC’s Bay Area affiliate</a>: “We
unintentionally overlooked laws that require even foreign employees to
be paid based on local US standards.”*

*Just so we’re clear: is there anyone reading this who doesn’t know that
any person working in the United States is legally required to be
compensated according to United States laws?*

*Alberto Raymond, an assistant district director with the US Department
of Labor told NBC, “It is certainly outrageous and unacceptable for
employers here in Silicon Valley to bring workers and pay less than the
minimum wage.” And that applies to EFI especially, which posted just shy
of $200 million in revenue in its last financial quarter. EFI is
publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange, and the company’s in the
business of computer peripherals (mainly printer-based stuff).*

*The eight employees are being paid $40,000 in owed wages; they were
reportedly installing computer systems at the company’s headquarters.
EFI was charged $3,500 — yes, seriously — for being at fault.*

Here’s the <a href="http://w3.efi.com/about-efi/senior-leadership-team"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">management team</a> of the racist,
slave-holding firm in question. Unsurprisingly, not a lot of flava
there. If you’re going to chain brown people to their desks, forcing
them to work for food, you’re probably not going to invite them into the
boardroom. It should come as no surprise that Guy Gecht and his team are
liberal democrats who <a

Democrats.
