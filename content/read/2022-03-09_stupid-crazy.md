Far-left talking head Michael Kinsley once said that a gaffe is when a
politician accidently blurts out the truth. It was a funny line that has
been popular in Washington for a long time, because everyone in
Washington knows it is true. It is not just politicians who lie to their
voters. Everyone in Washington lies. In fact, the semi-permanent ruling
class lies more than the elected class. As a result, they are less prone
to gaffes, but every once in a while, one of them blurts out the truth.

Yesterday we had one such example. Victoria Nuland, the moral nullity
responsible for the disaster in Ukraine, was called up for a very
friendly chat about Ukraine with fellow warmonger Marco Rubio. This was
supposed to be part of the highly choreographed public relations
campaign in favor of starting war with Russia. Instead, Nuland blurted
out what should never have been said. That is, the United States has
been running biological weapons labs in Ukraine.

<https://thezman.com/blogfiles/Nuland.mp4>

The reason for Rubio’s question about the bio-labs is this has been
circulating on-line since last week. The Russian Ministry of Defense
posted documents they said were found at a biological lab in Ukraine.
This was ignored by Western media, but then the Chinese government made
a statement about it. This is harder to ignore and it started to get
traction on-line. Rubio assumed Nuland would dismiss it as
disinformation, which was in his copy of the script.

Rubio is not a smart man, but like all politicians he has the vermin
like rapaciousness that has come to define the political class. When
Nuland confessed that the US was operating biological labs in Ukraine
and they were worried that the Russians would find out about it, so they
instructed the Ukrainians to destroy the evidence, Rubio’s lizard brain
kicked into action. He quickly got her to employ the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=561" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Opposite Rule of Liberalism</a>, which is now the
Opposite Rule of Liberal Democracy.

Briefly stated, the Opposite Rule of Liberal Democracy says that you
should take whatever they say, start with the opposite, and you are
close to the truth. In this case, she hilariously rolled out a version
of “they cry out it pain as they strike you.” This was one of those
moments people used to call a Freudian slip. She blamed the Russians for
doing what she was doing at that very moment. Her entire life is based
on blaming others for what she herself is actually doing.

Another interesting aspect of this gaffe is that the foreign policy
establishment heard about the bio-lab documents last week. They probably
knew about this from Ukrainian sources prior to the Russians posting the
documents. After all, the State Department was running the labs, so they
knew they existed and they knew the Russians would capture them at some
point. Again, no one in charge has any doubts about the results of the
Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This is why they planted a <a
href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/02/ukraine-biolabs-conspiracy-theory-qanon/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> in Foreign Policy claiming this
is the work of the QAnon shaman, the guy dressed like a bear who entered
the Capitol on January 6th and who is currently rotting in prison. This
is a classic political tactic. You not only get your version of the lie
in circulation first, but you also tie the truth to conspiracy theorists
and crazy people in order to anathematize it. This has been the go-to
move of Washington since the Clinton crime family blew into town.

That is what makes the Nuland-Rubio exchange amusing. Marco Rubio is as
dumb as a goldfish but he knows how to read his lines and follow
direction. If politics did not pay so well for so little work, he could
have made a career in movies. He read his line expecting Nuland to
repeat the QAnon stuff. Instead, she blurted out the truth and he had to
try and save the scene. It was one of those moments when you see just
how dumb the people are behind the Ukraine fiasco.

Putting the performance issues aside, the question that should be on
everyone’s mind is just how crazy are these people? We know that America
had a hand in the Covid lab leak that set off the Covid pandemic. The
media is back-paging this story now, but the evidence is clear that the
virus came from a lab and it was most likely the lab in Wuhan, which was
supported by the American government. We will never get the full truth,
but we know the basic outline now.

China is a serious modern country with a serious government, so maybe
this collaboration made sense in some way. Ukraine is not a serious
country and it certainly does not have a serious government. Its
government is literally run by a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPT4oGTOHRo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">television comedian</a>, the local version of Mr. Bean.
Even if there is some reason to justify this, the time to close it down
was months ago when the Russians started building up forces for what the
American government said was an invasion.

There is a recklessness here that should be terrifying to serious
people. Victoria Nuland is a stumble-bum with a long history of
screwups. She was caught on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2XNN0Yt6D8" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">tape</a> during the American overthrow of the Ukrainian
government in 2014. In tradecraft for beginners, they teach students to
assume all electronic communication is being monitored by people with
hostile interests. Cubicle jockeys at Langley get fired for making this
sort of error, but Nuland just keeps getting promoted.

It is no wonder the world is rocketing toward disaster. It is not just
that Victoria Nuland has a job, but that the people around her think she
is highly qualified. In other words, this stupid woman is the part of
the iceberg we can see. These are the same people now responsible for
avoiding a global calamity over the war in Ukraine. Even more
frightening is the fact that not a single politician in either party is
pointing out what should be obvious even to Marco Rubio now.

This will not end well.
