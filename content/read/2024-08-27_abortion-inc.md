A new trend in the world of internet politics is a reboot of an old
trend in actual politics and that is the abortion issue. Abortion was
good politics for both parties since Roe because it let them posture
without having to do anything. The Democrats promised to defend abortion
and Republicans promised to end it. Meanwhile the issue languished in
the courts until the Trump court overturned Roe. Since then, both sides
of the abortion battle have been trying to revive their money maker.

To some degree, they have been successful. The people we call the left
have convinced themselves that the election will turn on abortion. They
generate fake polls and fake news stories to goose the online influencer
community. Of course, the most gullible of that bunch, the right-wing
influencers, take the bait. There is no group less politically astute
than the right-wing influencers. The media then uses online chatter to
talk about the abortion issue as if everyone cares.

The truth is, no one cares. Just
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">two percent</a> of people list abortion
as a major concern going onto the election. As always, economics is what
matters. The people who care about abortion are the most predictable
voting bloc in America. The pro-abortion people vote Democrat and the
anti-abortion people vote Republican. It is why both parties took these
voters for granted for fifty years. They knew that these voters would
never alter their behavior.

The new wrinkle this time is also a reboot, of sorts. The usual suspects
are now running a media campaign online trying to convince people that
Evangelicals and pro-life people are abandoning Trump because he opposes
a federal abortion ban. The abortion ban idea is a last gasp effort to
keep the abortion rackets going. If they cannot pretend to fight over
Roe, maybe they can pretend to fight over whatever they will call the
bill, if they ever get around to drafting one.

<a href="https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Republicans Against Trump</a> (R.A.T.) have been
spinning up fake pro-life and Evangelical accounts on Twitter, now
stupidly called X, who do the classic bit of pretending to be a
disillusioned former supporter. “I have been a lifelong X, but I will
not support Y because he is not 100% in favor of X” is one version. The
other version is “I have always voted for Y, but because of X I cannot
support Y this time.” The R.A.T. people have
<a href="https://rvat.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invested</a>
heavily in this gambit.

The result of this is we have one side pretending abortion is the
pivotal issue of the campaign and the other side using abortion to
undermine Trump. For his part, Trump has staked out what was the
conservative position on the abortion issue since the courts sacralized
it in the Roe decision. The American system is designed to send
normative issues to the smallest political unit of the country.
Therefore, it was un-American for the court to impose Roe on the
country.

The stated goal of the pro-life movement for decades was to overturn Roe
and then fight it out on the state level. Trump delivered his end and
Pro-Life Inc. will never forgive him for it, but the general public is
thankful. A dirty little secret of the abortion issue is that people
would rather not talk about it. Normal people find crotch warriors to be
icky and strange. Moving abortion out of national politics means never
having to think about abortion again and for that the public is
thankful.

This is, however, another bit of mask dropping for the so-called right.
Professional Evangelicals, professional social conservatives and the
usual suspects have abandoned their old federalist principles in favor
of a national abortion ban, because they think it is good for business.
Once again, we see that those “conservative principles” they never
shut-up about are relative, relative to their ability to make money off
of them. Everything about conservatism is a racket.

The fact is, however, the conservatives of fifty years ago were right to
argue that Roe was a terrible decision because it violated the American
social contract. For a big, diverse, and complicated country like
America, there are few normative issues about which you can get broad
support across all regions. Therefore, most issues, like abortion, are
best managed locally. Just because they now think it is more profitable
to argue against this does not make it less accurate.

It is what makes a federal abortion ban every bit as immoral and
un-American as the Roe v. Wade decision. On the one hand, it violates
the basic American notion that moral issues should be decided locally.
Family issues are decided by the family. Community issues are decided by
the community. On the other hand, it is an effort to impose the morality
of the minority on the majority. This runs counter to the long held
American opposition to minoritarianism.

In the end, the abortion issue is symbolic, in that it represents the
old civic nationalist America of the late 20th century. People could
argue over abortion, because the much larger issues that come with
cultural decline were still far down the road. As those larger issues
now appear much closer, abortion, along with the civic nationalist
culture, is fading into the history books. As civic nationalist America
gives way to tribal identity America, the debate will be tribal, not
civil.
