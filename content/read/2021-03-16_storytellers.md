People in the modern age tend to think of people in the prior ages as
being primitive or unsophisticated in their understanding of the world.
This is mostly a modern thing, something that arose along with science.
Once man started to understand the material operations of the natural
world, those prior explanations for natural phenomena started to look
rather silly. One reason for the primitive – modern dichotomy is a sense
of embarrassment that our ancestors were so ignorant.

The truth is, of course, those primitive beliefs about what makes the
leaves change color in the fall or why certain people refuse to live by
the rules of society were useful and often quite clever. Stories about
nature not only helped people understand and predict natural phenomenon,
but they also provided a moral lesson. One thing science is telling us
is that people are natural story tellers, because we have a natural
preference for abductive reasoning over indictive or deductive
reasoning.

The primitive – modern dichotomy is not just a battle between rational
explanations of the world versus beliefs about the world. Various forms
of Christian belief, although not all, are modern relative to prior
forms of belief. The Christian logic of man’s relationship with God is
very sophisticated compared to ancient belief systems. It was a great
leap forward that became a foundation of Western civilization. The
belief that the world operates by fixed rules is an axiom of the modern
age.

Christianity has been subject to the primitive – modern dichotomy by
radicals since the French Revolution. With the rise of science, all
religion has been gratuitously lumped into with privative beliefs.
Ironically, this is a primitive belief itself, as humans are
biologically wired to believe. Belief is one of the oldest modern human
attributes that probably coevolved with language. Like language, belief
facilitates knowledge by providing a way to efficiently containerize
abstract concepts.

In this regard, radicalism is best seen a primitive reaction to the
advance of our material understanding of the world. The French
Revolution may have started as a reasonable objection to the
aristocratic system, but it quickly led to the Cult of Reason, which
looked like a Bronze Age pagan festival. Today we see the same thing,
but the pagan god at the center is called science. People are wearing
codpieces on their faces and using grimy canvas sacks because science.

Notice how the primitives are saying that the rush to the border is <a
href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-crisis-biden-pelosi-trump-climate-change"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">caused by climate change</a>, rather than
the infantile tantrums of the new President. It is not excuse making or
a distraction, at least not entirely. The people saying this nonsense
know that tens of millions of people believe Gaia is angry at our
lawnmowers, so they are happy to heap their troubles on the goat of
climate change. If we just repent, Gaia will relent and lift these
terrible plagues from us. Oh, save us Gaia!

This is not just rank and file oogily-boogily. The people at the top of
our society are more like shamans and soothsayers now. The high priests
of Progressivism [are
blaming](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-climate-change/)
the Covid panic on climate change. It is no surprise that this stuff is
belching out of Harvard, as it has been and continues to be the primary
training ground for the high priests of the Progressive faith. Founded
by Puritans, it is the most prestigious indoctrination academy of the
Judeo-Puritan ruling elite.

The ruling class embrace of increasingly bizarre forms of animism is not
without its amusing aspects. In less sophisticated times, the court
would have had an astrologer or wizard to impress the court with magic
and soothsaying. Today, the court magician is little Italian fellow
named Anthony Fauci, who is better suited to play the role of court
jester than court magician. Modern paganism has become self-parody but
combining the clown and the priest into a single role.

Another hallmark of primitive thinking is the person charged with
finding those responsible for angering the gods. Currently, the name for
those in league with Old Scratch are called conspiracy theorists and the
tool for unleashing sin in our community is
[disinformation](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22304518/hbo-trailer-upcoming-qanon-movie-disinformation-researchers).
We now have “experts” charged with analyzing how Old Scratch uses
disinformation to trick us into sin. The similarity between this bit of
oogily-boogily and the use of spectral evidence in witch trials should
be obvious.

Of course, you cannot have witch trials without some witches, and you
need witch hunters to supply those witches. This is where the [cast of
dingbats and
airheads](https://vdare.com/articles/doxing-the-doxers-antifa-s-war-against-regular-americans-is-run-by-spoiled-rich-kids)
employed by C-list news sites find their place. These otherwise useless
people roam the countryside looking for “haters” who knowingly speak
blasphemy and spread heretical thoughts. Instead of an actual witch
trial, the mob goes to social media, points, and ululates at the sinner
until they go away.

One of the more amusing witch hunters is a dingbat name
<a href="https://twitter.com/megansquire0?lang=en" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Megan Squire,</a> who is employed by a university as a
full-time witch hunter. Her formal title is professor in the computer
science department, but it would be more accurate to call her the chief
inquisitor of the one true faith. It is a nice bit of irony putting a
raving lunatic in the most rational of fields. Maybe Gaia likes a good
joke once in a while. Regardless, Squire’s job is as an increasingly
deranged witch-hunter for the Left.

Using the old primitive – modern dichotomy, it is tempting to think we
are descending into a primitive madness. This age is riddled with people
no better than wizards, warlocks and dervishes who would have easily
found work in the most primitive of times, just using different jargon.
Megan Squire would have read entrails instead of “data” to explain why
the village boy is a witch. Instead of Gaia causing the plague it would
have been, well Gaia. Some things never change.

The truth is though, human progress has always been a struggle between
the rational and the irrational. When the rational and spiritual
correspond, we see rapid advance not only in material knowledge, but in
spiritual understanding. The so-called dark ages left us with the most
stunning of architecture for a reason. When they are at odds, we get a
war between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. Usually, the
lie beats the truth, because the liars are better storytellers.

adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
