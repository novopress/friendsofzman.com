One of the tricks the Clintons popularized for getting around rules and
protocols was the sudden collapse in enforcement of the rules and
protocols. Instead of violating one specific rule that was hindering
them, they would violate all the rules. This way they could blame the
system or just unintended errors. This made it hard to see the specific
rule they were violating, which made it hard to see the caper. They hid
their crimes in an avalanche of sloppiness.

This seems to be what the Bidens were up to when Joe was Vice President.
His brother and son wanted to trade access for cash, a common political
crime. Influence peddling is probably the second oldest crime. If you
can get some important guy to do something or entertain doing something,
that has tremendous value, so you sell that ability to people who want
to influence the important guy. This is pretty much how all legislation
is devised and passed into law in Washington.

This is also how politicians monetize their position. Maybe the wife
gets a job at a high powered lobbying firm. Maybe the family members get
jobs at companies that just happen to support the politician. Sometimes,
as with Nancy Pelosi, the spouse gets to partner with someone with lots
of insider access to make incredibly shrewd business deals using that
insider information. Of course, the spouse, as we saw with Pelosi, is
the conduit for some of the insider information.

For congressmen and senators, this is all perfectly legal. For the Vice
President, it is completely illegal. Joe Biden could slip his brother
some information about pending legislation or regulation, but he could
not trade on the really good stuff. That is the international stuff
involving high level access to the President. The Vice President is not
allowed to auction off classified information either. He has access to
information that is priceless to foreign players, but it is not for
sale.

This is where Hunter comes into the picture. This is also where the
Clintons came into the picture as well. You see, when Hillary was
running the State department, her pervert husband was traveling the
world giving speeches. Those audiences were pouring billions into the
Clinton foundation in the form of speaking fees. Team Biden, no doubt,
looked at this and thought they could do the same. Get Hunter and Jim
Biden out there working the international market for cash payments.

The problem for the Bidens was two-fold. One they did not have a
foundation to launder money through, so they had to produce some new
conduit. The other is Hunter was a crackhead and Jim has no useful
skills other than being Joe’s brother. If they start getting hired to do
speeches, people will notice. It is beginning to look like the plan was
to have these two idiots get big contracts and consulting gigs with
foreign players, in exchange for something more than access.

This is why Joe Biden was sprinkling secret documents all over the
place. You see, his son and brother had access to the family homes and
offices. If Joe were to carelessly leave secret documents at these
places, totally by accident because he is getting old and forgetful,
Hunter and Jim could accidentally stumble upon them. Maybe they would
see something in those files that they could use in their dealings with
the foreign players like China and Ukraine.

Breitbart has a <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/01/18/exclusive-hunter-biden-lived-in-wilmington-house-with-classified-documents-while-bagging-millions-linked-to-the-highest-levels-of-chinese-intelligence/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> documenting when Hunter lived
in the family home and when those documents were in the family home. Of
course, Hunter claimed at the time to be paying rent of fifty thousand a
month. Now, he was on drugs at the time and spending his days doing
those drugs with prostitutes, so maybe his claim about spending that
much for rent was just what you get from a druggie. After all, he left
his laptops containing intimate details of his life with a repair shop.

The Washington Free Beacon <a
href="https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/photos-place-hunter-biden-in-corvette-at-site-of-classified-docs-in-july-2017/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">digs further</a> using Hunter’s laptop to
establish the timeline of Hunter living at the house and working for the
Chinese. The angle that the conservative media is pursuing is that
Biden’s reckless handling of secret material was far worse than what
they are accusing Trump of doing. Trump kept his secrets in a big vault
guarded by the secret service, not a crack addict. That is the stick
they are supposed to fetch, so they do not look at the other angle.

The real angle here is the brother. No one is looking into Jim Biden,
who has been a business partner with his brother for fifty years. This
ProPublica <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-profitable-business-of-being-joe-bidens-brother"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">article</a> on Jim and Joe’s long and
complicated business relationship details how the two of them have
worked in tandem through Biden’s career. Unlike Hunter, Jim does not
have a crack problem or a taste for hookers and naked selfies. He
operates a complex web of financial companies and financial transitions.

If you wanted to launder money, there is no better way to do it than
through a series of interlocking financial companies that move money
around daily. Maybe Jim hears or sees something when visiting his
brother and maybe he mentions that to an overseas client who maybe plops
a few million into one of Jim’s deals. A little here and little there
and before long a man who spent his life working for the government is
worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Funny world.

That is the old Clinton trick. If Biden were handing his brother’s
intel, that would turn up on the radar of the spooks eventually. If Joe
is just sloppy and lots of people have access to that intel, then that
means the leak could be anyone. If the sloppiness ever came out, then
the conservative media would have Hunter to chase around, rather than
Jim who is not as fun to profile. It sounds overly clever, but politics
selects for people who are good at cooking up schemes like this.

Just as we will never know the extend of the Clinton crimes, we will
never get the real story on the Biden corruption. Whoever is getting
this story into the media has real power and motivations they will never
reveal publicly. Maybe the whole thing is a setup and it has nothing to
do with corruption. Maybe the corruption was so egregious that even the
spooks were offended by it and they are exacting some revenge. Either
way, the place to look here is the bother, not the son.
