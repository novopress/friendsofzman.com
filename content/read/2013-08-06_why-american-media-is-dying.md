rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story is a great example of what is
wrong with the American media</a>. First off, everyone knows that
autograph brokers are grifters. They operate on the same moral plane as
drug dealers and pimps. You just assume they are lying. Now, let’s
assume ESPN does not know this going into the story. When the dirt bag
tries to sell them the video, that should be the point when the reporter
and editor realize they are dealing with a person who lies a lot.The
fact it was done secretly makes this undeniably obvious.

Now, the press reports on shady characters every day so that’s not a big
deal. What is a big deal is they decide to partner with the low-life by
helping keep his identity concealed, so he can scam future athletes. By
keeping his identity concealed, that’s what they are doing. If this
guy’s name gets out, no one will deal with him. ESPN is helping him by
keeping him anonymous. In the law, this is called accessory. ESPN is not
directly robbing athletes, but they are facilitating it by helping this
guy stay anonymous.

There’s another issue here. Why is ESPN making an issue of this? No one
gives a crap what this kid is doing to make side money. The NCAA may
care, but that’s their business at this point. of course, ESPN would
never do this with the black athletes. They move heaven and earth to
excuse the bad behavior. If this was a black kid, the story would be
about how he is being exploited by the evil whites. Everything the media
does is tailored to fit the anti-white narrative,m because the people
running the media hate white people.

Putting aside the anti-white agenda, the problem with the media is they
have an adversarial relationship with their alleged customers. Instead
of challenging the people in charge on behalf of their readers, the
media thinks they need to challenge their readers on behalf of the
people in charge. In time, someone is going to figure out that attacking
the media is a win-win scenario and that’s when the public turns on the
press. Politicians sort of know it, but they never take it all the way.
One day, some will figure it out.
