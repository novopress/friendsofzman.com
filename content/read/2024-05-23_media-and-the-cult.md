A mostly unexamined aspect of the ongoing crisis is the role the media
plays in keeping the managerial class misinformed. It is always assumed
that the firehose of lies that come from regime media is designed to
trick the public, but the truth is no one in charge cares about public
opinion outside the extremes. Politicians come and go, and the parties
take turns pretending to be in charge but the administrative state and
the managerial class that runs it are permanent.

One only has to look at the presidential elections over the last thirty
years to see that elections have no impact on policy. Bill Clinton was
supposed to be a break with the polices of Reagan and Bush, but things
changed very little. Bush was supposed to bring decency back to the
White House. Instead, he empowered the neocons, who set about making war
on the world. Obama was supposed to put an end to all that war making,
but instead doubled down in Afghanistan.

If you could map changes in public policy from election to election
since the Cold War you would end up with a line that slowly moves
upward. The only change we see is slightly more of the same with each
change in administration. The same can be said of the changes in the
House and Senate. As we have recently seen with the Republicans in the
House, they are just a shadow of the Democrats, who shadow the
Republicans as they take turns in the majority.

The reason for this is ninety percent of our elected representatives
never have to fear the voters. They only have to fear the wrath of their
party leaders, who are the representatives of the economic elites that
underwrite the system. For the typical congressman or senator, there is
no profit in appealing to the voters, if it means going against party
leadership. That can only result in a primary challenge, so the rational
course is to do what the party tells them.

If the political system is now immune to public opinion, then why are we
awash in mass media filling the public square with propaganda? One
reason is inertia. There was a time when winning the voters mattered and
the media was an essential part of how the parties presented their
claims to the public. Listen to media figures talk about their
profession and they often sound like museum pieces. The Washington Post
hilariously has the line, “Democracy Dies In Darkness” on its masthead.

Another reason for the explosion of agit-prop might be that as the
number of safe seats has grown, the consensus between the two parties
has narrowed. That means the range of acceptable dissent has narrowed as
well. Look around Washington and there is only one acceptable position
on most issues. For example, you can wail about the southern border, but
you cannot oppose immigration. You can “care about working families” but
you cannot oppose finance capitalism.

When a broad range of positions are tolerated, the focus is on winning
the public to your side, but when the range of tolerable positions is
narrow, the focus must be on keeping everyone inside that tolerable
range. That is where the media comes in with its firehose of official
nonsense. The point is not to sway or trick a skeptical public, but to
enforce conformity of opinion inside Washington. Ironically, this was
the primary purpose of the media in the Soviet Union.

Take for example this <a
href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/global-security-mandates-victory-ukraine-211128"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> at the National Interest. This
is one of the many neocon publications used to control official debate
on foreign policy. It was founded by Irving Kristol, one of the founding
members of the neocon cult. The post reads like it was written by a
crazy person, but that is because it is a collection of assertions
circulating in the mass media for years. The point of the post is to
keep these assertions circulating and therefore the default position on
Russia.

Imagine you are a congressman sitting on a committee that serves the
interests of the Military Industrial Complex. Image further that you
made the mistake of reading unapproved analysis of the war and the war
claims. You might be tempted to question the people making the claims,
until you run into this wall of official opinion that sprouts from every
regime outlet and every regime member. Even if you are skeptical, you
will find nothing but hostility to your questions.

In many respects, Washington now operates like a cult. People at all
levels are recruited into politics because they conform to the attitudes
of the cult. Those who show a lack of enthusiasm are either bullied into
submission or expelled. Meanwhile, those inside are subjected to a
constant wave of mass media that reinforces the currently acceptable
opinions of the cult leaders. The media is an endless chorus praising
the cult and the positions held by the cult.

Another aspect of cults is that the people inside them lack the
perspective and self-awareness to see themselves as being in a cult. No
one ever says “I decided to join a cult” because no one in a cult thinks
they are in a cult. Instead, they think the logic of the cult explains
everything that needs explaining. To those outside, the logic of the
cult seems weird and possibly dangerous. The people inside appear to be
painfully divorced from reality, maybe even insane.

This is exactly how normal people see Washington. They see lunatics
ranting and raving about imaginary demons, while obvious problems are
ignored. One congressman after another swears allegiance to a foreign
power, while hooting about China and Russia influencing our elections.
This is all amplified by a mass media system that is designed to reward
such behavior and punish any hint of skepticism about the narrow set of
acceptable opinions.
