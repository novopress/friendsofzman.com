The false dilemma is an informal fallacy which is based on the false
premise that there are only two options in a particular situation. The
fallacy is not in the logic, as with other fallacies, but in the
premise. It is a useful rhetorical trick, so it turns up in political
debates and propaganda. “We must do X or Y will happen” with Y being
something everyone assumes to be bad. The idea is to limit the choices
to one that is preferred and one that no one would willingly choose.

It is such a highly effective rhetorical strategy that what we call
conservatism rests on a foundation of false choices. No matter what the
left proposes, the right opposes by offering an option that is doomed to
fail versus what the left proposes. A good example was the homosexual
marriage debate. The left proposed redefining marriage to mean sharing
rent and a bed. Instead of rejecting this out of hand, the right
proposes civil unions, thus leaving us with two degenerate options.

We are seeing this again with the war over the antiwhite pogroms labeled
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It is not an accident that the acronym
DEI could easily be DIE, as the people behind this do not hide their
intensions. When they say they want to eliminate whiteness, there is
only one way this can happen. If one were to call for eliminating
Jewishness, you get compared to Hitler. Therefore, logic dictates that
when they say they want to eliminate whiteness, they mean white people.

Under normal circumstance, when someone makes a credible threat on your
life, the response is not to offer a compromise or pretend the threat is
not real, but that is exactly what conservatives are doing in the face
of these pogroms. Christopher Rufo
<a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1746967866342265125"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> the only option to these
antiwhite pogroms is for white people to embrace a colorblind morality.
In other words, white people should put all their energy into a fantasy
program rather than defend themselves.

The vision of a colorblind society may be appealing, but the fact that
it does not exist and has never existed is called a clue. Whites have
displayed some capacity to live under such a regime, but nonwhites
clearly cannot exist this way. Outside of European lands, the skins game
is the rule. We will never see non-European societies fling open their
doors and invite the world into their lands. As we see every day, when
these people enter European lands, they bring the skins game with them.

What Rufu is offering up is a false choice. You can put all your energy
into this fantasy of a colorblind, multi-racial, multi-ethnic society or
you can succumb to the antiwhite pogroms that are raging right now. The
point of framing it this way is to eliminate other options, like whites
joining the skins game. Not only does this framing sideline other more
reasonable options, but it also subtly endorses the moral claim by the
left that there is something immoral about whiteness.

Another example is this Elon Musk
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1746917457313353942"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in which he says,
“Discrimination on the basis of anything other than merit is wrong.” The
natural response should be, “who says?” but that is not what you see in
the replies. Instead, everyone accepts the false choice that you can
either allow nonwhites to play the skins game unopposed or you dream of
a day when no one plays the skins game. Again, whites joining in on the
skins game and maybe winning at it is off the table.

As an aside, his comment should make everyone’s skin crawl. He is saying
that having personal preferences is immoral. Since all humans have
tastes and preferences, a feature that makes up a large part of our
nature, he is hoping to anathematize most of what makes us human. For
Musk, the ideal human is a moist robot. This is the thinking that lies
behind the culture war. With the right amount of force, people can be
re-coded into what society needs or simply eliminated from the
population.

Regardless, the point of his post is to foreclose the parsimonious
option which is to let people discriminate for any reason they like.
Free association was the foundation of America into the last century.
The settlers to the New World literally acted on their belief that
people should live where they want and with whom they want, which is why
they got on boats and came to the wilderness. The immigrants of the 19th
and 20th century acted on the same premise.

Of course, the ultimate false choice, the very heart of American
conservatism, is the assertion that they cannot use the same tactics as
their opponent or exact revenge when they have power, because that would
make them as bad as the left. In other words, the choice presented as
conservatism is to adhere to a set of rules that guarantee failure or
succumb to some abstract conception of moral turpitude that is somehow
worse than losing.

In the end, the culture war is not a clash of visions, but rather a
struggle among white people about how best to avoid the fight. The
winning side in this fight has always relied on some form of the false
choice in order to prevent engaging the people called the left in the
culture war. This means the path to victory in this civilizational
struggle starts with overthrowing conservatism and its spiderweb of
false choices. In its place is a new form of identity politics to
counter the current identity politics.
