Democracy is a system where the very dumbest citizens are given the
power to decide the fate of the people. The smart fraction fights with
one another in an attempt to convince and cajole the stupid into
selecting wisely. Sometimes it works, most times not, but given enough
time the stupid will live up their reputation and the democracy murders
itself. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Massachusetts is a good example</a>.

*Forget about Charlie Baker crying. The ones who should be crying are
the voters.*

*Would you rather win the Lottery or the election?*

*What’s your signature dish in the kitchen?*

*What’s the best Halloween costume for your opponent?*

*Those were actual questions in a debate that will be the last time most
voters see Baker and Democrat Martha Coakley in a televised,
face-to-face confrontation.*

*Baker’s cry will get the most attention in this bizarre debate
showdown. And that’s not a bad thing for a Republican accused of being a
heartless budget cutter. Baker’s cry did not look contrived — he looked
like a dad watching the last scene of “Field of Dreams.” And it
certainly won’t hurt him among the most important voters in this race —
women.*

*But let’s face it, the question — when was the last time you cried? —
was designed to get the candidates to cry. Great for a Barbara Walters
interview, but for a gubernatorial debate?*

*There’s nothing wrong with asking an offbeat question that could show
voters a more human side of the candidates. But the gimmick has gotten
old fast. Pretty much every debate now ends with a “What actor should
play you in a movie?” question.*

*But now we need to know whether Baker or Coakley would throw away the
election with a chance to be rich. Is there any chance either of them
would go with the Lottery? No, even Coakley wouldn’t be that clueless.*

*And there were other head-shaking moments. Like one of the panelists
repeatedly pressing Baker or Coakley to take a “pledge.” Apparently just
saying you’re against something is not enough anymore. Now you have to
pledge not to do it.*

*There were some telling moments in the debate that will probably be
more significant than Baker’s weep show. Baker looked like his old,
snippy self at times — not his best side. When Coakley joked she had
heard Baker’s question before, the Republican shot back, “Sort of like
the ones you asked me before?”*

*But the crying pretty much wiped out that moment.*

Massachusetts is home to many great colleges and universities. Tens of
thousands of very bright people move to Boston every year for work. Yet,
this is the best they can do for governor. One Senator is a pathological
liar and the other has not lived in the state for decades. They have one
of the most corrupt legislatures on earth. There’s your choice for
governor. A blubbering fool or a semi-retarded hack.
