I finally had the time to clear out the inbox and go through everything
from the post office box, so for a day, at least, I’m caught up. One of
the reasons I thought about doing a live stream or something similar was
that it could be a way to answer mail each week along with the live
questions. I’ve tabled that idea for now, as I have too many other
things on my plate at the moment. The day job has been keeping me crazy
busy of late, so I don’t need another project right now.

Another upside to doing a mailbag show this week is I was not tempted to
talk about the ghetto riots spreading around the country. They have not
started here in Lagos yet, but the locals are beginning to feel left
out, so it is matter of time. Given that the lock down is still
technically in place, they are just looking for an excuse to act up.
With the new wave of censorship crack downs rolling out, it is probably
a good idea to avoid talking about this stuff on YouTube right now.

The fact is, I don’t care all that much. I don’t care about these people
as I don’t think they should be in the same country as me. We’re onto
three generations now of trying to make this work and we still have
blacks rioting in the streets. Many of the rioters in Minneapolis are
foreigners. These are non-whites imported to punish the whites living in
places that had few non-whites. Instead of sitting around Africa they
were plopped into the Twin Cities by people who hate us.

The people responsible for Ilhan Omar are the problem, not the savages
running wild in the streets. Sure, the rioters are the immediate problem
if you live in one of these places, but they are a symptom. The cause is
a ruling class that defines itself by its hatred of white people. You
can be sure that the usual suspects are laughing themselves silly over
what’s happening in Minnesota right now. As far as they are concerned,
the people of that city are getting what they deserve.

That said, never let a crisis go to waste. Normal white people looking
at this, even the ones beaten into self-hatred, sense the truth. This
would not be happening if we just accepted the reality of race. Whites
and blacks cannot live with one another. It can never work. No amount of
speech laws and limits on white freedom will cause blacks to behave
themselves. What we are seeing is the natural order, their natural
order. It’s who they are and we need to accept it.

The fact is, these people rioting are not me. They are not my people. I
feel no connection to them in the best of times. I don’t hate them. I
live in a 70% black city and see black people every day of my life. I
harbor no malice toward them, but I feel no connection to them either.
On paper, we are fellow citizens. In reality we are people thrown
together by fate and the vengeance of the ruling class. Pretending that
these people are our people is just lunacy. We are not the same.

This is underscored by the fact that many of the rioters are recent
imports from the former third world. They are guests rioting in the home
of the host. That’s not a fair analogy, because a host invited his
guests. These people are more like home invaders than guests. No one
asked for them to be here. No one was walking around Minneapolis saying,
“We need for Africans.” The people of that city were never asked if they
wanted more Africans. They never got a say.

That’s the lesson here. These things we are seeing are not the fault of
the people for voting for the wrong guys. The polices that have created
these riots were never put up for a vote or even discussed openly.
Whether it is race policy or immigration policy, the decisions were all
made in the shadows. The public was never given a chance to have their
say in the matter. If Trump wants to send the National Guard somewhere,
send it to the halls of Congress. That’s where the trouble lies.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
