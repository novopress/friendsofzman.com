Hollywood figured out a long time ago that they could make a lot of
money on a sequel to a popular movie. They could count on attracting
most of the original audience without having to think too hard or spend
a lot of money. If the sequel was just the original with a couple new
twists, then it was easy money. The reboot is a similar concept, except
it relies on nostalgia to sell the concept. Fans of the original Star
Wars movies could take their kids to the reboot of the franchise.

The general consensus is that the reboot and remake are a sign that
Hollywood has run out of creative writers. The wrinkly brains are now in
the technical end, making cool graphics and special effects. The writers
arrive in a short bus. This cultural dead end where they just keep
rebooting prior ideas has reached a point where they are rebooting
reboots of reboots now. The only novelty is they are stripping away
anything of interest and replacing it with ideology.

The same process has been happening with politics. The first little hint
of it happened with Bill Clinton who was sold as his generation’s JFK.
This played on Baby Boomer nostalgia, which has been powerful juju since
the 1980’s. The first genuine political reboot was Obama. He was pitched
as the black JFK, which was a foreshadowing of what has been happening
in popular culture. Just as the role of JFK was being played by a black
guy, everything on TV is now played by nonwhites.

The thing that was interesting about Obama was that despite all the talk
about the future, they were obsessed with the past. His signature
program, health care, was a re-do of the failed health care fight in the
1990’s. His Russian reset was a rebuke of Reagan’s tough approach to the
Soviets. His Iran policy was a re-do of what happened in the late 1970’s
under Carter. The Obama years were a series of remakes of old defeats by
the Left, but this time they were the winners.

Of course, the Trump years had a strong undertone of nostalgia for the
1980’s and Reagan’s “Morning in America” theme. It was clear Trump
planned to run a similar reelection campaign until Covid. The crazies,
of course, relived the Nixon years, replaying the fantasy version where
they got to actually impeach their foe, rather than have him resign. The
Trump era was a very weird nostalgia trip for an aging political class
unable to contemplate what comes next for them.

It appears that this election season, the Republicans are planning to
release a reboot of one of their old franchises, the Contract with
America. To great <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/01/10/exclusive-kevin-mccarthy-lays-out-gop-commitment-to-america-a-clear-contrast-between-republicans-democrats-for-midterms/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">fanfare</a>, Kevin McCarthy, the top
Republican in the House, has unleashed the Commitment to America, which
is a remake of the New Gingrich program. According to the
<a href="https://www.republicanleader.gov/commitment/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">poster</a>, “Republicans helped build the greatest
economy in a generation and the American way of life was thriving. We
are ready to do it again. This is our commitment to you.”

The problem with the sequel was always that the original successfully
followed the woman’s swimsuit model. It was long enough to cover the
important bits and short enough to keep everyone interested. In other
words, the original addressed all the important plot points and the
characters had finished their arc. Reboots offer the chance to retell
the original story with a slightly new angle. Today, of course, that
means replacing the white males with strong diverse females.

The problem for the Republicans trying to reboot the Gingrich franchise
is that most people recall that it was not a scintillating success. It
was a clever marketing strategy that got Gingrich the speaker’s gavel,
but exactly no one is romantic for the early 1990’s or has warm thoughts
about Newt Gingrich. If anything, Newt Gingrich is a reminder that
managerial conservatism was a disaster. It led directly to the “Big
Government Conservatism” of the Bush years.

Looking at the site, it is clear that the Republicans went to Hollywood
and snatched a few writers off the short bus. “Restore. Rebuild. Renew”
is the answer to “Build Back Better” which is itself a hollow slogan.
Under each word is a list of “promises” that are so vague and
meaningless, you wonder if this is a deliberate insult. The top item
under “Restore” is a promise to do the same things for Covid that the
government has been doing for two years now. “What do we want? More of
the same!”

Perhaps the most amusing and ridiculous claim under the “Restore” tab is
the promise to address tech censorship. Kevin McCarthy and the House GOP
is so mobbed up with Silicon Valley cash they should be forced to wear
corporates logos on their suits like race car drivers. They have opposed
every effort to do something about the gross abuse of civil rights by
these firms. This is also true of Conservative Inc., which is bought and
paid for by big tech money as well.

What is most remarkable about the plan is that it manages to avoid every
issue of interest to the typical Republican voter. The Gingrich strategy
was to sound like radical reformers, while not threatening anything
important like entitlements. McCarthy’s strategy is to sound completely
harmless while promising to let the crazies continue smashing the civic
life of the country. You get the sense this is a promise to the
oligarchs that they will have no trouble with the Republicans.

Notably, there is nothing in this plan on immigration. That is because
the GOP is not just the party of open borders, but the party of
aggressive importation of the least desirable people into your
neighborhood. When you vote Republican, you are voting for your children
and grandchildren to live as hated minorities. The GOP is the other side
of the turd sandwich with regards to immigration. One side wants open
borders and the other side wants to build massive welcome signs.

Getting back to the reboot topic, what this plan suggests is that the
critics of Hollywood are correct about the lack of ideas. The
Republicans have nothing to offer, so they are rebooting old campaigns.
McCarthy has never had a job or met a normal American, so he has no idea
who he is pitching with this slop. It sounds good to the feckless
airheads in marketing, so he just assumes it will work. It will not get
him in trouble with his handlers, which is what really matters to him.

Finally, what is shaping up in the 2022 midterms is a replay of the
Biden strategy in the 2020 election. The Democrats hid Biden away and
made the election about Trump being Hitler. McCarthy and the Republicans
will hide under their beds and hope the public is sick of the Democrats.
In other words, it is another election in which one side wins by
default. The political class has nothing to offer, because from their
perspective, everything is going great and you need to shut up.
