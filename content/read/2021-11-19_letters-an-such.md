It is that time of year where the loafing begins. Every year the loafing
seems to start earlier for some reason. When I was a young man, people
worked right up to the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. The boss would let
people go early on that Wednesday, but lots of people worked the
following Friday. Then it became a four day holiday for most people,
even working class guys. Then Wednesday became a day when people took
off to get a jump on travel.

Covid seems to have added some more loafing to the schedule. Last year
Tuesday was the big travel day, at least for car travel. That means
Thanksgiving is pretty much a five day weekend for most office people.
I’ve noticed that my work e-mail is in sharp decline this week and that
many people will not be around at all next week. Thanksgiving is quickly
becoming a full week off for many people. That means the Friday prior
will soon become a day in which nothing gets done. Loafing is our
strength!

There is plenty to moan about in this life, but the expansion of
Thanksgiving into a weeklong holiday is not one of them. It is a
quintessential American holiday that has not be corrupted by the times.
They have not found a way to blame white supremacy or claim it was
invented by slaves. There is the Indian guilt issue, but those efforts
have largely failed take hold. Despite the worst people trying their
worst, the holiday remains a time to enjoy the simple things and be
thankful for them.

The negative this year is the Covidians have started to demand vaccine
passports from relatives in order to come over for dinner. How much this
is happening is unknown, but it is an idea being pushed by the usual
suspects. A fake poll was created that claimed 60% of people are
demanding vaccine passports at Thanksgiving. It was just a bit of
guerilla marketing from a sleazy marketing firm, but the media wants to
hear this, so they have been pushing the idea.

Most likely the real number is pretty close to the number of people who
were sure Boris and Natasha were hiding under their bed. The same people
who put on their serious face to explain to you why Trump is Hitler now
put on their serious face to tell you that you have to wear a life
jacket so they will not drown. Covid has made plain that our crazy
people problem cannot be solved with conventional means. Physical
removal of the crazy people is the only path back to normalcy.

That may turn out to be the gift of Covid. If these people are sure that
the rest of us pose a threat to them, maybe they remove themselves.
Carve out a bit of Mexico or perhaps a spot in the Amazon for them. They
can be safe because they are all in it together and the rest of us can
get back to normal. Imagine a world without Covidians, it is easy if you
try. If such a thing occurred, Thanksgiving would become a global one
month holiday because the world would be so grateful.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
