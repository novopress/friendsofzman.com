[This is an interesting
post](https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2014/01/24/Hannity-Politico-Savage/)
that give an insight into the way Conservative Inc. operates behind the
scenes. Talk radio is not as popular as it used to be in the 80’s and
90’s. Limbaugh created the genre in the late Reagan years. He was not
the first guy or the only guy, but he perfected the format as a
combination of right-wing shouting, humor and a fast paced format. Sean
Hannity is a loudmouth and Savage is a bit of a nut, but they stick to a
format that works and compete for the same audience.

Conservative talk radio is often just Republican talk radio. In the Bush
years, guys like Hannity and Limbaugh were so far in the tank for Bush
they should have been getting a W2 from the GOP. The discourse is pretty
low, but it can be informative and a good check on party politics, but a
lot of it is just cheerleading. Still, give Hannity credit for using his
head in this case. He is using friendly media to win a fight with a
rival, while Savage is relying on gossip mongers from the Left.

[The recent uproar over Huckabee’s
comments](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/01/23/nbc-cnn-reporters-rush-to-take-mike-huckabees-libido-comments-out-of-context-quickly-forced-to-issue-corrections/)
at some Republican meeting is a good example of the stupid party in
action. Dana Bash, a far left activist posing as a media person, is an
obvious liar, so why give her access? The woman works for NBC which is
nothing more than a megaphone for the Left. MSNBC, their cable arm, is a
collection of people who should be institutionalized. Why the
Republicans would invite these nuts in and give the media credentials is
the great mystery of our time.

But, being predictable losers is their role.
