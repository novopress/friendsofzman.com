In a private conversation, there was a lively back and forth about the
books that new people to our politics should read. One of the hidden
truths about this side of the great divide is it is a highly literate
movement. People drawn to this type of politics tend to enjoy reading.
Then there is the fact that our politics is not cut off from the Western
intellectual tradition, which is the case for most conventional
politics. As a result, we have a vast library of writing on our topics
of interest.

That vastness is a problem. This side of the great divide has a lot of
diversity of interests and thought. If you are drawn over by the human
science, there are dozens of great books to get you started. If you are
into right-wing intellectual history, you have more books and writers
than you can read in a lifetime. Everyone on our side has their
favorites. Many have a book or a writer they credit with their
awakening. The new person can find it intimidating at first.

With that in mind, the show this week is about the books to get someone
started on understanding dissident politics. These are not foundation
texts or anything like that, just doorways to the sorts of topics that
get discussed here. When you are a kid learning to write, you start with
the big pencil and wide-ruled paper. You do not use that for the rest of
your life. It is just how you get started. The books for the new person
to our politics should work the same way.

The thing about the books covered in the show is they challenge the
reader’s conditioning on various topics. That really is the essence of
dissident politics when you stop and think about it. Because liberal
democracy and the technological state cannot comport with the reality of
the human condition, you are left with two choices. You can deny the
reality of the human condition or question the morality and legitimacy
of the prevailing orthodoxy. That is the great divide in a nutshell.

Of course, this is the sort of topic that generates endless disputes,
because no two people have the same list. There is no doubt that many
people will be outraged at the selection of titles in the taboo book
section. Well, outraged by one of the books and what I have to say about
it. At some point in the future, that will be the topic of a full show
and maybe a series of posts. Again, the point here is a gentle
introduction to the taboo subjects that can only be discussed on this
side.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
