**Note:** Let’s face it, you stink. The way to stop stinking is to take
a bath and for that you need soap.

A question that never gets asked is whether or not Christianity, however
one wants to define it, can survive in the modern West. Those opposed to
Christianity, which is the entirety of the managerial class, never
discuss it. Actual Christians are aware of the challenges they face, but
they just assume they are on the side of angels, literally and
figuratively, so the question does not require an answer. If you are
sure yours is the one true faith, then the survival question has been
answered.

Looking at <a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/compare/attendance-at-religious-services/by/state/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey data</a>, just three states,
Alabama, Tennessee and Utah, have a weekly church attendance over 50%.
On the other side, New Hampshire is the only state that has a majority
who never attend services at all. Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts are
all in the high 40% range and on their way to being majority
non-Christian. Given that Yankeedom has ruled the country since
Gettysburg, it is no wonder that the rest of the country is slowly
losing its religion too.

In Europe things are bleak for the Christians. Four countries, Belgium,
the UK, France  
and the Czech Republic have majorities who have never attended church.
Spain and the Netherlands are in the high 40’s. Poland and Ireland are
the only two countries with a majority of church goers, but in both
cases, the younger population has caught the modern disease and they
avoid church. In Poland youth attendance is 27% and in Ireland it is at
33% according to recent surveys.

In fairness, there are a few modifiers to these numbers. One is how one
defines regular church attendance. Most surveys break it down between
weekly, multiple times per year, rarely and never. One can still
identify as a Catholic, even if one is only going to mass on a monthly
basis. Similarly, an adult that does not attend service, but went to
church as a child and was baptized into the faith could still identify
as a Christian, but not necessarily a practicing one.

The point being is that you can quibble with the numbers and whose
survey is better, but the overall picture does not change. Christianity
in the West is not just on the wane, but in many places, it is on the
way out. When you shift from the private sphere to the public one, it is
rare to find any discussion of Christianity. The Christians allowed on
stage must profess an undying devotion to Jewish people, Israel and
various myths and legends important to the Jewish people.

This void in the managerial class is being filled by people who define
Christian as the bad whites they despise. The recent gay marriage bill
made possible by the Republican party, allows the IRS to strip churches
of their tax exempt status if they are not willing to play along with
the homosexual marriage charade. Like the Obama health care bill, the
point is mostly about attacking Christians. The people in charge want
the believers to know that they are not welcome in America.

This is where the survival question comes into play. Most people who
regularly attend services think they have a constitutional right to
their faith. Evangelicals, for example, when they are not celebrating
Israel, are waving the flag. These are people who not only think they
are on the side of angels, but they also think they have the law on
their side with regards to how they practice their faith. These people
are completely unprepared to defend their faith from the coming assault.

Mainstream Protestantism has been thoroughly corrupted. On the east
coast, the surest sign you are near an Episcopal church is the rainbow
flag. That sect has given itself over completely to the worship of
homosexuals. The Southern Baptist Convention now sounds like the
grievance studies depart at a third tier state college. The Methodists
are in a civil war over the usual questions. Of course, the Catholic
church long ago succumbed to the pink mafia that took over the clergy.

The fact is, the Christian in modern America is under assault not just
from the historical enemies of the faith, but from the institutions he
has relied upon to defend religious liberty in America. The churches
themselves have signed onto the programs that promise to make it
impossible to be a Christian, at least one who thinks Scripture is more
than just some pointless stories. Just as important, the believers seem
to be psychologically unprepared for the fight.

From a purely secular and analytical perspective, religions evolve to
solve the basic questions of human society. Religions help explain the
natural world and provide authority to the customs and traditions of a
people. Often, religion provides at least part of the answer to the
central question, who are we? It is religion that helps people
understand the observable world around them. That ranges from the
natural phenomenon to the nature of human relations.

The modern West is increasingly defined by the deliberate avoidance of
observable reality, along with prohibitions against noticing certain
things. The authority for these prohibitions is mob rule, guided by an
invisible hand that is on the list of things no one is allowed to
mention. Christianity offers an alternative source of authority and
Scripture encourages the believer to engage with the human condition. It
is not hard to see why that invisible hand guiding the mob hates
Christians.

This brings us back to the beginning. Can Christianity survive? The
answer depends a lot on how one defines Christianity. Within this
century the mainline churches will have disappeared, their nicer
buildings having been made into museums. Baring a cataclysm that derails
modernity, institutional churches are doomed. That will leave the
believers to fend for themselves as ad hoc communities. They will have
to redefine what it means to be a Christian in order to survive the
onslaught.

That presents another problem. Most of the people who would join an ad
hoc community of believers embraces the universalism and openness that
has been the ruin of Christianity in the West. In a world where
demographic reality is the defining feature, the refusal to recognize
demographic reality is a suicide pill. In other words, if Christianity
is to survive, it will have to become something different. Christians
will have to find the authority for new survival skills within
Scripture.

It is easy to see why Christians prefer not to think about this stuff.
It is a complex problem that defies simple answers. It is a lot easier
to type “Christ is King!” in a Gab post than think about these
challenges. Like all the other problems facing Western people, the
future does not lie in the past. Whatever comes next for Christians will
be fashioned from what is available in the future. Like most Western
traditions, the old Christianity will not survive the revolution.
