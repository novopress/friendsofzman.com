------------------------------------------------------------------------

An old criticism of liberal democracy was that the system would
inevitably become less stable, as each election would result in a wild
swing in direction. The people would support position X in one election
and then support position Y in the next election, with X and Y being
opposite positions on some issue. We are getting a sense of that now
with Biden’s handlers promising a reversal of Trump’s policies, which
were allegedly a sharp break from the policies of predecessors.

One reason for this is that liberal democracies are bourgeois societies,
in which the old instinct to dress up interests in objectivity and civic
virtue remain strong. It is considered immoral for a group to press
their interests in a purely partisan way, so everyone insists that
science and the public good are the motivations. The deliberate
destruction by the elites of the civic life of societies is not just a
naked attempt to remake the world in their image, but an effort to
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-myth-of-build-back-better/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build back better</a>.

Bourgeois objectivity, however, does not work as a brake on the
partisanship that comes with democracy. Instead, it works to magnify it.
Every issue, instead of being a fight between interested parties, is a
fight for eternal truth and cosmic justice. Voting for party X is not
about where your bread is buttered, but about where you stand in the
moral hierarchy, relative to the people in party Y. The polarization we
are seeing today is not about practical politics, but about good versus
evil.

Of course, in order to arrive at the point of bourgeois partisanship,
you first must arrive at a post-scarcity society. When the threat of
extinction is no longer obvious, the people are free to indulge in
fantasy and leisure items. In the Cold War, the West avoided this state
because the threat of nuclear war was real. The sober-minded had the
primary duty of keeping the frivolous under control. Once that was
removed, the frivolous and insane were free to run wild through society.

The result is a strange paradox. The issues that rise to the top are
increasingly trivial and ridiculous, but the partisanship around them
becomes more intense. Two men playing house is a fact of life going back
to the dawn of man, but suddenly the embrace of this became a defining
issue. If that was not ridiculous enough, what followed was a parade of
men in dresses demanding we play along with them. Then it was people
with a list of bizarre pronouns demanding validation.

At some level, the bourgeois partisan knows this, but instead of
acknowledging the obvious, the demand for public judgement becomes more
intense. In the Cold War, the Left had get out the vote drives, by which
they meant rigging the voting in major urban areas. Otherwise, there was
a quiet understanding that voting should be left to those who pay
attention. Today, voting is a moral duty and we are endlessly reminded
of it in the months before an election. The truth must be decided.

This is probably the only thing about liberal democracy that makes
sense. If everyone votes, then the winners can claim a mandate. If Trump
voters, for example, realized the vote was being rigged and boycotted
the election last week, the winners could not legitimately claim a
mandate. This used to be a tactic in low-trust societies ruled by an
elite seeking legitimacy at the ballot box. In modern societies,
everyone assumes the truth is fifty-percent-plus-one, so everyone must
vote.

Here is where we stumble into another paradox of liberal democracy and
another source of partisan anger. All human societies have elites and
those elites control the institutions of the society. In theory, popular
forms of government either check the power of the elites or place real
power into the hands of the people. In one variation, the powerful
propose and people dispose. In the other variation the people both
propose and dispose. Democracy is about the public will.

In reality, voting is entirely meaningless in a liberal democracy, as
the elites control public policy exclusively. The winning side in 1992
thought they were getting a folksy John F Kennedy, when they just got a
skeevy Bush I. Bush voters thought they were getting a dim version of
Reagan, but got Lyndon Johnson. The people celebrating Biden think they
will get reeducation camps and proscription lists, but instead they will
end up with a less coherent version of Bush II.

As the researchers in <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/core-reader"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this 2014 study</a> found,
those elites that are a permanent feature of all societies control
public policy in a liberal democracy, just as they do in every other
form of government. In liberal democracy, however, the people are blind
to this reality, instead believing that the market place of democracy
decides. If elite opinion tracked public opinion, no one would mind, but
when elite opinion is at war with the public, it becomes another source
of partisan rage.

This leads to the final paradox of liberal democracy. The most rational
strategy for minority interests is to withdraw consent, as this strips
some legitimacy from the winner of the democratic process. Instead,
partisans become more intensely partisan after each electoral defeat and
every betrayal. In two years, those red MAGA hats will be a bloody shirt
inspiring partisans to vote for the GOP, who will promptly betray those
voters at the first opportunity. The anger will keep rising.

The reason that the world appears to be going mad is that liberal
democracy, without the brake of thermonuclear war, is a runaway train of
partisan fury. Instead of disputes being settled at the ballot box, each
election intensifies the dispute. Haldane famously observed that
fanaticism is man’s greatest invention. That’s because it is his
greatest weapon. As partisan fury rises in liberal democracy, the
fanatic becomes the most valued participant. It becomes rule by fanatic.
