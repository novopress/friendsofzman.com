**Note:** Behind the green door I have posted some audio
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/457127" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">commentary</a> on the Charlottesville trial. In addition
to written items, I will be posting some short clips on whatever comes
to minds. Something extra for the supporters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Off-year elections are often cast as bellwethers by the media as a
pretext to turn them into national events. They will claim that the
results are a test run for the next national election or maybe the test
for some new idea. Back in the 1980’s, Bob Casey ran for governor of
Pennsylvania promising to expand health care services for women, which
was trumpeted by the media as his ticket to victory. This idea was the
start of the Democratic push for communized medicine in the 1990’s.

We are seeing a similar energy around the governor race in Virginia.
This time the reason to cover the race as a national event is Donald
Trump. This is allegedly the first big election after the fascism was
purged from Athens on the Potomac, so the results will tell the ruling
class if the medicine is working. Added to the story is the antiwhite
school curriculum in the state. Opposing hatred of white children is now
a sign of white supremacy, so the election is a referendum on that.

As with all elections, the result is set in advance. In this case, a win
by the Democrat will be sold as a triumph over Trumpism. It will also be
a warning to the GOP that they better cuck harder if they ever hope to
win another election. On the other hand, if the Republican wins, then it
is proof that eschewing Trumpism is the ticket to success for the
Republican Party. In other words, no matter the result, it is proof that
your superiors are right, and you should shut up and obey.

The wildcard is the imaginary vote. It used to be that the silent
majority was the mystery factor in elections. That is still true, but
after the 2020 election, that silent majority is silent because they
only exist in the garages of election officials and the warehouses of
inner party officials. This is where they now keep the majority of the
votes. That is a bit of an exaggeration, but in the age of rigged
elections, the subplot to every election now is how the inner party will
manipulate the results.

This subplot has some stock elements now. Here we have the story of the
[crowd
gap](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/11/02/youngkins-crowds-dwarf-mcauliffes-on-election-eve-494939),
which was hilariously on display in 2020. The Republican gets big crowds
while the Democrat speaks to empty parking lots. Then there is the
[early voting
stories](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/early-voting-hits-record-high-in-virginia-ahead-of-dead-heat-governors-race.html) to
prepare the ground for why those crowds did not matter at the ballot
box. The term “early voting” now means something very different. Of
course, we have the
[crazies](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/11/republicans-are-already-claiming-the-virginia-election-has-been-rigged/)
accusing normal people of bad faith for questioning these results.

The point of this drama is mostly entertainment. Politics in America is
pure <a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/heroes-and-villains-2/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">theater</a> where few issues of import
ever get discussed. The real human beings who voted for Biden in 2020
did so for one reason. They hated Trump, even though Trump was pretty
much a Queens version of Bill Clinton, a guy they worship. Most people
voted for Trump in 2016 out of spite. They hated the Republican Party
for its treachery, and they really hated Hillary Clinton for being
herself.

In the Virginia race there is a real issue on the table, but it has very
little to do with the two candidates. It started as a local revolt
against the antiwhite school curriculum now known as CRT. Parents found
out about it by accident, a byproduct of the Covid panic and their kids
doing on-line classes. The parents flipped out at the vulgarity of it
and before long there was a populist revolt in suburban Virginia. The
Republican picked up on it and it has now become a key issue in the
race.

Another subplot to this race is the fact that the inner party seems to
be trying to purge the old Clinton machine. This is why the “good voting
machines” will not be used in Virginia in support of longtime Clinton
crony Terry McAuliffe. Youngkin is a harmless wimp right out of GOP
headquarters, so letting the outer party have a win serves the interests
of the inner party. They knock off a Clintonite and they reinforce the
argument that Trump is bad for the Republican Party.

One interesting note on the race is that McAuliffe has not talked about
any of the signature issues of his party. Covid has been ignored. The
Build Back Better stuff has not been raised at all. They had Biden
stagger around at a school in Northern Virginia but that was so
embarrassing they put an end to it. The Virginia race underscores the
fact that the inner party is headless right now. By extension it means
the government is headless, operated behind the scenes by others.

What this race is mostly about is the geezers at the top of the
political establishment trying to restore the system to what it was
before Trump smashed up the elite consensus. Youngkin is a washed out
Bush Republican who promises to be quiet and never rock the boat.
McAuliffe is Bill Clinton, the affable crook who will look the other way
as long as he gets his beak wet. Those were good times for Washington,
and they desperately want to go back to that time.

The thing to care about is the vote totals. In 2016, a record turnout in
Virginia, there were 3,750,916 votes counted. In 2020, with the most
popular man since Jesus on the ballot, they counted 4,375,998 votes.
That was a whopping 16.6% increase. Joe Biden was that popular in
Virginia. In 2017, they counted 2,584,906 in the governor’s race, which
is a good benchmark for this one. If the 2020 vote count was legit, then
we should expect close to three million votes this time.

In the end it is nothing but sound and fury signifying nothing. If he
wins, Youngkin will get on TV a lot but do none of the things he
promised. The schools will keep teaching antiwhite bigotry and the state
will continue its slide into becoming nothing more than a bed and
breakfast for government workers. Spend a day in Northern Virginia and
you will see that it is nothing like America. It is Casablanca on the
Potomac, a place where shady characters from around the globe do deals.
