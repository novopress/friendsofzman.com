After an election, there are two things that almost always happen. One
is the winning side draws the wrong lesson from their victory. The
lesson they usually draw is that that they are on the right side of
history or that the gods are on their side. Same idea, different magic.
One of the anomalies of the recent US Presidential election is that
Trump is not prone to magical thinking and his own party hates him, so
he seems fairly level headed about his win. His party is acting like
they lost so no gloating there.

The losing side, on the other hand, draws any number of wrong
conclusions. Republicans generally assume they lost because they were
too far to the Right, so they immediately start adopting the positions
of the Left. The Democrats will often conjure up some sort of conspiracy
theory, thus the ridiculous recount efforts now under way. The point is
the losers never learn from their mistakes and therefore just rely on
the other side burning itself out or screwing up so they can be the
default option in the next election.

The way the Democrats lost and their wobbly condition, suggests they may
be in for a much longer winter than typical. There is a British Labour
Party vibe to them these days. You see that in <a

The article then goes onto to describe a few top operatives as soulless,
corrupt incompetents. What’s interesting here is you very rarely see
anyone on the Left question anything about the Cult, including its
political arm. Self-awareness is not their thing. That and doubt on the
Left is always assumed to be a gateway drug for apostasy, so it is
fanatically discouraged. Losing and losing badly may be forcing some
soul searching. The party is now a regional party, for all practical
purposes.

What I think we may be seeing is the the end of the normal life cycle
for an ideological party. The Democrats, like British Labour, were
always a coalition party that adopted an ideology as a theme song, more
than a political philosophy. Political parties are practical things.
They organize to win elections so the party can us the power of the
government to reward friends and punish enemies. In order to win they
must make compromises and they often have to get ideological opposites
to temporarily agree.

Ideological parties, on the other hand, are impractical, which is why
they tend not to last long. They cannot compromise and instead go
through purifying rituals in which the doubters and questioners are
boiled off. Eventually they become so narrow they no longer have any
practical benefit, if they were ever able to have any at all. The
Libertarian Party is a good example. It is useless as a party because it
spends all of its time wrangling over theory and doctrine. That and
figuring out how to keep <a

target="_blank">fat naked guys</a> from showing up.

Like Labour, Democrats went through a period where they jettisoned many
of the people who were willing to challenge the Cult over political
strategy. In the 1990’s, moderate Democrats were voted out in favor of
moderate Republicans. The elected officials that remained after the ’94
election were a bunch of pols from the New Left, who took up leadership
positions. They went about turning the party into an ideological
movement, that had some early success, but has been burning itself out
over the last decade.

Take a look at the Democrat Party and it looks a lot like the CP-USA
after World War II. The people in charge like being in charge and use
ideology to maintain their grip. The foot soldiers with any talent are
heading to other things, leaving an increasingly incompetent core. The
Democrats have become the party of “Kill the Honky” because Progressives
have become a suicide cult that thinks salvation can only come after the
last white guy is hunted down. Outside of Zimbabwe, that is not a
winning formula for electoral success.

The Democrats are not going away and Labour is not going away in the UK.
Something will replace them. In the UK, it appears the new political
alignment will be SNP versus the Tories, with the foreign traitors in
London often siding with the Scots. In the US, we will probably see the
neo-cons waddle back over to the Democrat side to form a more centrist
coalition. There will be the identity political Left and the hyper
violent, lose wars of choice, Right in one party. The Republicans will
be the honkies from flyover country.

Regardless, progressivism cannot be the core of a majority coalition, at
least not in anything resembling a liberal democracy. At best, it can be
an influential part of a  coalition, but never the dominant part. In the
fullness of time, it may be understood that the worst thing to happen to
American Progressives was their final victory over one of the parties.
They may have discredited themselves to the point where their thing is
never the same again. Robespierre lost his head learning this lesson so
Nancy Pelosi should count her blessings.
