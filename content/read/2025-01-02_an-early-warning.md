The new year has started with a bang, literally and figuratively, as
terrorism was the big story on the first day of the year. A Tesla truck
exploded outside the Trump building in Las Vegas, killing one and
injuring seven. Then there was the car attack in New Orleans, where
according to news reports a car went on a rampage killing fifteen people
and injuring dozens of others. Police say the driver of the vehicle was
not alone and there is currently a manhunt for the others.

The identity of that driver in New Orleans has been released and to no
one’s surprise his ancestors were not on the Mayflower. The media is
calling him a “Texas man” but he was born to recent arrivals, most
likely from East Africa. He served in the military and had various
office jobs until he decided to go on jihad.
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205ek63433o" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar</a> is a good reminder that
absimilation is just as likely as assimilation. It is a thing we
increasingly see as alien populations increase in the West.

Assimilation means to become like that which you joined. As John
Derbyshire <a
href="https://www.unz.com/jderbyshire/orlando-paris-yorkshire-and-donald-trumps-unanswerable-questions-about-immigration/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">observed</a> almost a decade ago, there
is an opposite, absimilation, which means to become less similar to that
which you have joined. In the case of second and third generation
immigrants, this is a common enough thing that it has become the focus
of the overall immigration debate. While most absimilated migrants do
not go on murderous rampages, many refuse to assimilate on principle.

This is one of the problems with immigration that the Romans understood,
but our current oligarchs do not understand. When the alien population
is small, the pressure to assimilate is very high. Those who refuse can
find little support within their alien community, so they either
assimilate or leave. This was the case with 19th century immigration
from Europe. Some claim up to a third of European immigrants remigrated
because they could not or would not fit into American society.

When the alien population reaches a large enough size, there forms a
critical mass of aliens who refuse to assimilate and find enough support
within the alien population to survive apart from the main population.
This was the lesson of the 19th century when Italians packed into
ghettos became a society within a society. It turned out that even in
19th century America, assimilation is not automatic. The more alien the
population, the more difficult it is to assimilate them.

Of course, in this age, there is no effort to assimilate these people.
Instead, they are encouraged to let their freak flag fly in the name of
diversity. Further, there has been intense pressure on the native
population to move aside and not demand these new people quickly
assimilate into the native culture. The result is second a
third-generation migrants who are alienated by the deracinated state of
America and encouraged to hate the white population.

That alienation is not just with the migrants. It appears the Las Vegas
Tesla attack was done by a <a
href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/las-vegas-trump-hotel-tesla-cybertruck-driver-idd-as-army-vet-matthew-livelsberger/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">white man</a> named Matthew Livelsberger.
Like Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the New Orleans terrorist, Livelsberger was an
army veteran and served with Jabber at the same base in Texas. It is
looking like these two attacks are connected and the result of a group
that may have come together in the military. Long forgotten,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Nidal Hasan</a> was in the Army when he went on his
rampage.

It should surprise no one that alienated migrants are now finding common
cause with alienated natives this way. On the one hand, we have massive
importation of people unlikely to assimilate into American society. On
the other hand, we have a culture war against the native white
population, specifically white men. It is as if the ruling class is
trying to create the perfect conditions for terrorism. This is not an
unreasonable suspicion, given the performance of the FBI.

Even though these events took place in the new year, they are part of a
pattern we saw in 2024 from the FBI and the other security forces. The
assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania was due to staggering
incompetence. The same is true of the attempt in Florida by a guy who
should have been on the FBI radar. Time after time we see that the FBI
fails at its basic duties, most likely due to the fact they spend all
their time trying to frame people for the latest fads.

As we always see in these terrorism cases, the people involved in this
one will have been brought to the attention of law enforcement. The FBI
will say they had reports about these people. No one will ask what they
did with those reports, because the answer is they did nothing. Their
response will be to demand more money so they can frame some people for
whatever they will call this stuff. They will pretend they are now on
top of this new problem.

Putting aside the FBI malfeasance, this batch of terrorism is a reminder
that our rulers have created a tinderbox. The revolt against Musk over
the holiday break regarding Indian migrants should be another warning to
the oligarchs. To head off much bigger problems down the road, there
needs to be an immigration moratorium, including a halt to most “guest
worker” programs. Every new arrival is a flammable log on the hot coals
of the deracinated American population.

Further, there needs to be a national effort to assimilate the current
alien population into the native European culture. Part of this needs to
be remigration. Those who refuse to assimilate must leave. Cultural
diversity needs to be treated like communism was treated in the 1950’s.
It took an economic collapse and world war to assimilate the last great
immigration wave. That was with a diverse European population before the
major powers had nuclear weapons.

Unless the oligarchs wish to be swinging from trees, they need to head
off this looming demographic disaster. Things like diversity and
openness are luxury goods that can be indulged in easy times, but the
easy times are over, so these leisure habits must be replaced with
realism. What the first day of the new year tells us is America has a
real problem with its population. That reality can no longer be ignored.
To fix it means being realistic about the human condition.
