Most men can remember back to a time on the schoolyard when two kids got
into a confrontation and one of them kept promising to do something bad
to the other if the other did not stop whatever it was he was doing. The
threat of consequences was supposed to deter the other, but the other
kid was undeterred, and the result was a fight, with the kid making the
threats getting the worst of it. Bullies often come to a bad end like
this as their bullying is based on threats.

If you are a member of the managerial elite, it is unlikely that you
have such a memory as you were raised by women, so no school yard
fights. As a result, the logic of the bully, issuing escalatory threats,
makes perfect sense. After all, if you can conjure something worse than
the other guy is conjuring, then you win! Therefore, success is
determined by who has the greatest mastery of escalatory dominance, the
alleged ability to escalate a conflict beyond that of an opponent.

This is the engine that has been driving the war in Ukraine. For close
to a decade the Russians have objected to what Washington has been doing
on its border in Ukraine, but Washington has responded with the promise
of more of what the Russians found objectionable, rather than search for
a compromise. Once the Russians crossed into Ukraine, Washington
unleashed the sanctions war and promised even more punishments,
including the promise of regime change.

Throughout the war, the approach from Washington has been to create some
artificial red line for themselves or Russia, and then cross it in such
a way as to suggest all future red lines will be crossed. Currently NATO
is having a debate about launching long range missile attacks on Russia,
from NATO countries or with NATO personnel, while pretending it is being
done by Ukraine. This is the bully threatening the kid who refuses to
back down with something worse than backing down.

Unreported in the West, Ukraine has been using Western supplied drones
to attack early warning radar stations in southern Russia. These are
part of Russia’s nuclear defense system. They play no role in the
Ukraine war, but Ukraine’s handlers are having them do this as a form of
escalatory dominance. The point is to signal to the Russians that the
West is not afraid of nuclear war. The madness of this is obvious, but
to a great degree that is the point, to seem mad.

We see a similar thing shaping up with China. Washington is going out of
its way to provoke China over the issue of Taiwan. Various officials
have been sent to the island for no other reason than to antagonize the
Chinese. A big package of weapons has been shipped to Taiwan and
Washington has increased the number of military personnel on the island.
Washington regularly talks about how it is actively preparing for a war
with the Chinese over the issue of Taiwan.

A great example of how the concept of escalatory dominance controls how
American ruling elites deal with the world is the last trip by Anthony
Blinken to China in which he went out of his way to insult the Chinese.
The State Department insisted on Blinken visiting China, where he held
meetings with Chinese leaders. He then went out of those meetings and
threatened them with sanctions. This was done to let the Chinese know
that there is no red line Washington will not cross.

This is not just a foreign policy strategy. The reason Trump is waiting
to hear a guilty verdict is the regime has always assumed that if they
cross enough red lines with regards to the rule of law, Trump or his
supporters will fold. For going on four years, it has been ever
increasing violence against both the rule of law and the customs that
have controlled our politics. The point of each new escalation is to
warn that there is no limit to what they will do unless you obey.

It is the unquestioned assumption in Washington that there is always
some threat they can issue that is so terrifying that the other side
will back down that has led them into a crisis for the regime. Half the
country now thinks the courts are corrupt beyond reform thanks to the
lawfare unleashed by the regime. We are remarkably close to the point
where a majority of Americans think we are ruled by lawless gangsters,
which even in easy times is an impossible state of affairs.

The crisis gripping the West is due, in large part, to the fact that the
system now selects boys and girls with no practical knowledge. Never
having had their bluff called and walking away with a bloody nose or a
black eye, they just assume such a thing is impossible, so they are free
to escalate their threats. It is not so much that their threats work,
but that they ought to work. In the artificial reality in which these
people live, the *ought* is the same as the *is*.

The Trump trial is a good bit of foreshadowing for how this widely held
delusion about escalatory dominance will end. At some point, the bluff
is called, and the bluffer has to either follow through or their raison
d’etre evaporates. This is the story of the bully who finally has to
fight and gets beaten. It is not the beating that ends his reign as a
bully, but the fact that someone stood up to him. This is what is
happening with the lawfare against Trump, who has called their bluff.

Unlike the schoolyard, the end of a regime that relies on escalatory
dominance is not so simple and tidy. The regime now has to hope the
Trump trial ends in a hung jury so they can maintain their stance. An
acquittal has them looking like fools and a guilty verdict has them in a
crisis far worse than Trump winning the election. Soon, the bluff will
be called over Ukraine and Taiwan. Once this happens, the regime has no
answer other than the unthinkable.
