“Workers of the World, Unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains!”

It is May Day, which used to be a pagan feast day, but was co-opted
first by Christians and then by Socialists and Communists in the 19th
century. In Europe it is associated with labor, as well as the politics
of labor, but in the United States it is mostly associated with
sandal-wearing goofballs from the local state university. There will be
no labor celebrations this year due to the virus lock downs. Like labor
movements all over the West, we have been successfully atomized and
isolated.

This week’s show is not about labor or the labor movements, as I did not
think of it until I was flipping my calendar over this morning. Maybe
next year I’ll do a podcast on Marx to coincide with the holiday,
assuming we are allowed to have podcasts. Given what we are seeing
happen in America at the moment, it is not unreasonable to think that
Chinese-style censorship will be the norm here very soon. The beautiful
people certainly think it is a <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/what-covid-revealed-about-internet/610549/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">good idea</a> and they tend to
get their way.

I’m getting a little salty about what is going on, but I’m trying hard
to maintain my reasonableness. There are plenty of people ready to go
onto the public stage and scream like banshees. <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hundreds-protest-michigan-lawmakers-consider-extending-governors-emergency-powers-n1196886"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These protesters</a> in
Michigan are a good example, although one has to wonder if they were
hired to play the part. That is a tried and true tactic of the American
political class. It was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first used on the Left</a>,
but then the Left borrowed it and <a
href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Charlottesville_%27Unite_the_Right%27_Rally_%2835780274914%29_crop.jpg"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now uses</a> it on everyone.

This is why political organizers have to maintain high standards. it’s
hard for outsider movements to do it, as they are programmed to recruit
anyone interested, but that;’s how the people in charge subvert the
opposition. These organic protests will be subverted by lunatics, many
of whom are on the payroll of state actors. Their job is to provide the
bad optics, so the mass media can then tarnish the protests with images
of lunatics in the among the protesters. it’s an old game, but it works.

You can’t help but wonder if what we are seeing is just a dry run for
something more permanent in the future. I don’t think this was
premeditated. It is just a good example of how events can take on a life
of their own. One things leads to another and before long the best of
intentions results in a madness consuming the people who set of the
chain of events with their good intentions. Like the radicals of the
French Revolution, our rulers are now captive to events they set in
motion.

Like many people I’m losing my patience for this ridiculous charade. As
the evidence stacks up it is clear the lock downs were a terrible idea.
It is time to go back to our normal routines, but the people in charge
have the whiff of authoritarianism in their nostrils and like a rutting
beast they can think of nothing else. They are now busy dreaming up more
insane restrictions just to humiliate people. It is increasingly
difficult to remain a reasonable person. I’m getting a little salty.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.
