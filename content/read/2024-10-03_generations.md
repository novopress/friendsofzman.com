Lost in the commentary about the vice-presidential debate is the looming
generational issue haunting the political system. On the stage that
night was a member of Generation X and a Millennial. J.D. Vance is not
the first Millennial to enter politics, but he is the first one to enter
the main stage. At forty years old, he would be the third youngest vice
president ever, if Trump wins in November. Walz would become the first
member of Gen-X to accomplish anything in politics.

Walz and Vance are good examples of their generation. Gen-X was known as
the slacker generation, mostly because they were not politicized like
the two waves of Baby Boomers that preceded them. They just wanted to do
what they needed to do in order to get a decent job and enjoy their
life. With the massive boomer generation ahead of them, ambition was
pointless, beyond the personal. That is pretty much how it has played
out for this relatively small cohort.

Tim Walz fits this profile. He kicked around in his youth, unsure what
he wanted to do with himself as an adult. After a while he went back to
college. He joined the National Guard because his father told him to
join. He then got a job teaching because that was available and required
the least effort. Serendipity got him into politics where good timing
seemed to be his best asset. Like his generation, Tim Walz is a guy to
whom life has happened, rather than a guy who attacked life.

In contrast, the life of J.D. Vance is like a well-executed battle plan.
Millennials are strivers and box tickers. Encouraged from the womb by
their mostly Baby Boomer parents and teachers to attack life with a
detailed plan, this is a generation that started building a resume in
kindergarten. Everything about their primary schooling was aimed at
getting into a good college. College was about landing in the right
career and their careers have been the accumulation of credentials.

That describes the life of J.D. Vance. One path out of poverty was the
military, so he went into the military. That opened the path to college,
so he went to the best college he could and got the best credentials he
could get. Those credentials opened the door to a career in the
swankiest of careers in venture capital. Unlike Walz, nothing about the
life of J.D. Vance is due to chance other than his current position. One
does not have much control over the choices made by Donald Trump.

The result of this generation gap was evident on stage. Walz probably
would have arrived in his Elmer Fudd costume if they let him, for no
other reason that it is more comfortable than a suit. He probably
watched sports instead of prepping for the biggest moment of his life.
Vance, on the other hand, was a machine. He crammed for the test because
it is what he has done his whole life. He went to the debate to ace the
exam and that is exactly what we saw.

You can expand this out to the top of the ticket. It is both symbolic
and ironic that the race is between an old white guy who speaks for the
America that is slowly slipping away and diverse girl boss who exists
only in the imagination of the bitter, angry managerial class. Trump is
not technically a Baby Boomer, but he is a man with the Baby Boomer
sensibilities. He is a guy who thinks the economy is the country, so a
good economy means everything is fine.

Harris is a <s>Baby Boomer</s> X’er, but her alien existence places her
outside of what most people would understand by the term. She was born
and raised outside of the country by parents who were not Americans. If
a writing team from Hollywood took a break from ruining classic movies
and were tasked with creating a story involving politics, they would
make the star a diverse girl boss like Harris. She would be smart and
sober-minded, however, miraculously always coming out on top.

The Harris as diverse girl boss from the movies can be taken further by
the fact that she has never earned anything in her life. This is the way
it works in film. Diverse girl boss never has to struggle and doubt like
the traditional white lead. She is just given everything she needs by
the writers. That is Kamala Harris. The biggest challenge of her life
has simply been showing up without her dress on backwards. Now she
expects to be handed the presidency.

The one thing missing from the picture is the hysterical female
Millennial. Another feature of that generation is that strivers like
J.D. Vance have had to navigate the hysterical female Millennial with a
head full of feminist nonsense. Female Millennial hysteria as escapism
is probably worth a book treatment. Much of the lunacy of the last
twenty years has been driven by childish girls who became girl bosses
rather than wives and mothers with a stake in their community.

The absence of this character from the current drama is probably the
biggest white pill of this election cycle. Even in the unserious world
of modern politics, the hysterical female Millennial is shunted over to
the side when the adults are talking. In this regard, the rise of J.D.
Vance could be signaling a return to normalcy once the Baby Boomers
shuffle off to the shuffleboard courts. Perhaps the answer to the harpy
all along was to simply ignore her while getting the job done.

One final angle here. J.D. Vance is the full expression of managerial
man. The fact that he walked away from that system into the populist
revolt against it suggest that managerialism lacks the cultural
fulfillment to sustain itself. One reason the media has been told to
hate him is that he is seen as a traitor. This is the main reason the
system hates Trump; he betrayed his class. This suggests that the new
left and right in our politics are managerialism versus culturalism.

The main take away from this election cycle for Baby Boomers and
Generation-X should be that your time is done. The people who will be
running things starting now are the people in their thirties and
forties. That means our politics and culture will reflect the
sensibilities of this generation. The least ethically centered
generation in American history will be defining the nation. Millennials
are an end-justifies-the-means generation and maybe that is what will be
required going forward.
