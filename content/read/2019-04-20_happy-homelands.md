I was on with Frodi Midjord, RamZPaul and Tiina Wiik to discuss
dissident politics on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as organizing
for our future efforts. We had some technical issues with Google, so we
went off-line for a while and then started over. Paul broke up the video
into three parts and re-published them. The live stream service from
Google seems like it has trouble every time I do one of these things.
Maybe I give up some form of bad mojo that causes havoc on their
servers.

I thought it was a good discussion. Frodi is a great guy, who has done
great work in the Scandinavian countries. We need more sensible people
out front talking about these issues. I think he made some good points,
especially about people’s risk tolerance. If you think your people are
worth preserving you do what it takes to accomplish it. On the other
hand, I don’t think they have the challenges we have here in America
with people being fired from their jobs for holding unpopular opinions.
I could be wrong.

Otherwise, I think I did better on this than I normally do on these
sorts of things. There is a skill to being a live streamer or a guest on
these shows. I just don’t do it enough to be comfortable with it. Paul
and Tiina do these shows all the time, so they make it look easy, but
there is a talent to make it look natural. It’s why I have avoided
getting into the video stuff to this point. I’d end up spending
countless hours trying to figure out how to look normal rather than like
I was making a hostage video.

Anyway, here is the show in three parts.
