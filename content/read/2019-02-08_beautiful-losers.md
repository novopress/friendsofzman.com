The response to last week’s show was interesting, in that I got a few
queries about people I mentioned from the old days. I have noticed this
before whenever I talk about the paleocons and their battles with the
neocons in the 80’s and 90’s. Everyone knows about the neocons, at least
they think they do, but the paleos seem to be fading from memory as they
fade from the scene. It is a case of the winners writing the history
books, so I thought a show about the paleocons would be something worth
doing.

The original plan was to do a segment on the various people who made up
movement, maybe read from their best work, but that would have been too
long and too boring. I like doing these sorts of episodes, but this is
not a history podcast. What I settled on is the formula I have used for
other episodes. What is interesting to me about the paleos is they were
right about a lot of things, especially their own flaws, but they failed
anyway. It is a great example of how having the facts on your side is
not enough.

Putting the show together, what struck me is just how much overlap there
is between the alt-right and the paleos. Despite this, you never hear
the alt-right talk about these guys or credit them for their ideas.
There is an anti-intellectualism to the alt-right that is maybe a
reaction to the academic aesthetic of the paleos. We have a library full
of writing by the paleocons, while the alt-right has dated livestreams
and podcasts. Given how things worked out, maybe that is a good thing,
but it is something to consider.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
