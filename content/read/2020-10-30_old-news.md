A funny thing happens every four years around this time. People get
tired of following politics and things get a bit quiet. In the before
times, the ad blitz on radio and television is what did it for most
people. By the last weekend of the election it was almost all political
ads depending upon where you lived. Today, with everyone immersed in
mass media, it is just a general fatigue. That’s why the show this week
is about everything but the coming election. It’s a bit of a
housecleaning show.

Election fatigue may explain why more and more people are voting early.
Once they vote they can ignore politics with a good conscience. The
civic impulse is strong, even with the crazies on the Left, maybe more
so with them, so getting this obligation over with allows for the mind
to shut down and stop consuming politics. If someone mentions the
election they can just say, “I already voted so it does not matter.” it
seems like a good way to head off any proselytizing.

Of course, the Left tends to dominate early voting. There was a survey
kicking around that showed that 81% of people who will vote for Biden
voted early, while only 32% of Trump voters planned to vote early. This
makes some sense. The Left is all about immanentizing the eschaton, so
early voting allows them to enjoy the fantasy they are sure will come
true on election day. Conservatives, in contrast, approach elections
with a sense of dread and foreboding, like going to the gallows.

That is the one innovation Trump has brought to politics. His rallies
are like rock concerts, where people go expecting to have a fun with
other fans. Holding these in the final weeks of the campaign works as
both entertainment relief and social proof to the people still unsure of
their choice. The visuals are very good optics. You can be sure that the
political consultants will cook up Potemkin versions of these. The
difference is they will be completely fake, maybe held on a Hollywood
sound stage.

Even so, the election madness is coming to an end. It looks like the
story is following the 2016 script with the polls “suddenly getting
tight.” Biden plans to spend the final days in places we were told were
safe just a week ago. He will be mumbling to an empty room in Minnesota,
a state that has not voted Republican in almost 50 years. It has nothing
to do with their polling. That’s ridiculous. He is six million points
ahead in the polls and a metaphysical lock to win on Tuesday.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
