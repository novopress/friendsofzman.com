The inspiration for the show this week is the ongoing collapse of
college football due to the financialization of the sport. I do not
consume much sportsball these days, but I will watch a college football
game. It was always my favorite sport to watch on television and it is
now the only sport I can watch at all. The rest are human flea circuses
woven within hours of commercials and agit-prop.

The appeal of college football has always been the variety. Each
regional conference has its own traditions, rivalries, history and style
of play. All of it was organic, having evolved with the leagues and the
teams over time. The schools themselves have weird customs and
traditions that often exist for reasons no one remembers. What people
know is those traditions are important.

The same people behind all of the other problems have been gnawing away
at these traditions for the usual reasons. They look at our culture and
wonder how they can turn it into a quick buck and then into something
vulgar. That is what is happening to college football through the lure
of television money. As a result, it is becoming the same degenerate
circus as the rest of entertainment.

There is another aspect here. This is much easier due to the domination
of the hired man in all aspects of modern life. Managerialism is rule by
a committee of people looking for a better job. They have no investment
in the current job, other than what they need to do in order to maximize
their return. It is a form of tragedy of the commons, except we pretend
it is free market capitalism.

College football is dying because it is run by people who always leave
the car running in the parking lot and carry a suitcase with them. If
anything goes wrong, they know the way to the nearest airport or border
crossing. Anything run by men who do not expect to be around very long
is never going to last. All of their decisions are in the near term, as
this is the extent of their interaction with the enterprise.

The Greeks say a healthy society is one where old men plant trees in
whose shade they will never rest. The Global American Empire is denuded
of trees because no one thinks about who comes next. This also explains
youth culture. Everyone pretends to be forever young so they never have
to think about who will tend their grave. Ours is a society of visitors
run by aliens.
