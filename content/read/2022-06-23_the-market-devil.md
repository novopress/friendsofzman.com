In the movie *The Usual Suspects*, one of the characters says, “The
greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t
exist.” It is a clever line that gets to the heart of the human
condition. When people have a clear understanding of right and wrong,
most of life’s dangers are avoidable. In the context of the film, it
turns out to be a perfect summary of what happens to the main
characters. They are undone by their unwillingness to accept clear moral
boundaries.

A similar thing can be said of this age. The greatest trick democracy
ever pulled was convincing the world that the marketplace exists. Much
of what ails the modern West is this naïve belief that the world is
controlled by market forces. The invisible hand, guided by the desires
of the majority, picks the winners and losers. Those who vex or offend
the majority will eventually be laid low by the market. Those on the
side of the majority will be raised up as the winner.

What is truly remarkable about this belief is not that people buy into
the surface logic but that they keep believing it despite the results.
To use another movie idea, this belief is the forever blue pill. Just
when people begin to see reality, someone comes along with a handful of
blue pills labeled “marketplace” and the people gobble them down to the
cries of “go woke, go broke” or some other ridiculous claim about the
beauty and majesty of the great god called the marketplace.

The power of this belief is best seen in the entrainment world, where
people channel their passions into entertainment franchises. The popular
YouTube movie critic, *The Critical Drinker*, has [this
bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7KZnsvFD88) about the *Star Wars*
franchise. Despite being well aware of the politics motivating the
people in Hollywood, a big part of his act is in identifying “the
message” in films and television shows, he is baffled as to why the
people behind this popular franchise are forcing their politics on their
fans.

The underlying assumption of his critique is that the marketplace is a
real thing and it will one day punish the people ruining his favorite
franchise. Yet, by any objective standard, the franchise was ruined a
long time ago. The second set of films was a clear cash grab and the
politically charged nonsense that followed looks like a critical studies
department at a fifth rate state college exploded on film. The franchise
has been a two decade long, carny trash political sermon.

In those two decades, the franchise has <a
href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Star-Wars#tab=summary"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">grossed</a> eight billion dollars for a
rough profit of seven billion dollars. The most grotesquely political
bits of the franchise, the last five films, has netted over four billion
in profits. In other words, the more they jam their carny trash morality
in the faces of the fans, the more money they make. The clear lesson
here is it does not matter what they do. The next *Star Wars* could
literally be Disney executives raping kids and it would make billions.

Another aspect of the false consciousness is the assumption that the
people making entrainment product are motivated by money. Because money
comes from the magic of the marketplace, the desire for money must lead
to a desire to please as many customers as possible. If this is true,
logic then says that the degenerate politics being pushed in these films
pleases the marketplace. After all, replacing the normal stuff with
abnormal stuff has been a boon to the franchise.

The believer in the marketplace cannot accept this so he remains
baffled. The truth is the people making our entertainment product are
motivated by money, but they know it does not come from magical market
forces. It comes from the people who control society and impose their
morality on the rest of us. Please the feminist orcs from HR and you get
a fat paycheck. In other words, in a democratic society it is not the
marketplace but the moral space that decides.

Entertainment has always been about public morality. Look back at the
earliest days of filmmaking and this is clear. The very first films were
efforts to undermine the prevailing morality in an effort to insert a
new moral code. The communists and fascists were trailblazers in
filmmaking, inventing things that are still with us today, because they
saw the power of entertainment to shape public morality. Go back even
further and the Greeks used theater to control public morality in
Athens.

All of this points to the fact that the marketplace is a creation of man
and like all of man’s creations, it is controlled by those with power.
After all, the marketplace is simply a set of rules and those rules must
be enforced. If the parties to a transaction have no fear of the rules,
they have no reason to abide them. Enforcement of the rules must come
from a party with power over both sides of the transaction. It is fear
of that power which makes the marketplace possible.

The people making movies and television shows understand this because
the people underwriting their projects remind them of it all the time.
The near monopoly held by the big content makers is possible only
because people with power have shaped the rules so that a small number
of players control the industry. The movie makers fear and respect that
power, so they always seek to please it. The reward is a lifestyle
beyond anything normal people can imagine.

This clearly applies to democracy itself. The overwhelming majority of
white people have been voting Republican for decades. In that time the
Republican Party has moved steadily away from the interests of its
voters. In fact, they have increasingly embraced policies explicitly at
odds with the interests of their voters. They have now reached the point
where they are mocking their idiot voters for trusting them. After all,
what are you going to do? Vote libertarian?

Despite the obvious, people continue to vote in the belief that the
marketplace will eventually punish these people. If a majority of voters
elect people who hold the opinions and values of the voters, the
government has to yield. People often say that Christianity has no
future because people no longer accept the supernatural, but this
November’s election will prove otherwise. People trust the supernatural
more than ever, but they now call their god the marketplace.
