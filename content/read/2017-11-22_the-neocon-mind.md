One of the things that struck me when I read Whittaker Chamber’s book
[Witness](https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Cold-Classics-Whittaker-Chambers/dp/162157296X),
was the point he made about his thinking, before and after his
conversion from communism. He said he still thought like a Marxist. That
is, the mental processes were still the same, despite his efforts being
aim at combating Marxism. David Horowitz made a similar point about his
own conversion. The way in which he thought, his rhetorical
inclinations, they remained radical, but in service to the goal of
stopping radicalism.

The man of the Left is one who puts everything into service of the
cause. The morality of the Left is that the ends justify the means. The
mere existence of the Clinton Crime Family is a testament to the utility
of this ethos. There was no rule Progressives could champion that the
Clintons would not violate. In fact, it has often seemed like the
Clintons exist merely to make hypocrites of everyone who supported them.
Yet, through it all, after every indignity, the Left finds some way to
twist the truth to support them.

That is the Progressive mind. The cause comes ahead of everything. When
Barak Obama won in 2008, he could have demanded a human sacrifice at his
inauguration, and the Left not only would have supported it, they would
have claimed only racists opposed human sacrifice. We are seeing the
same thing play out with the neocons, who have made their loony
“NeverTrump” cause into something close to a cult. Every event is spun
into some weird conspiracy or bizarre outrage. Hating Trump is their
reason to exist.

Jonah Goldberg has been a particularly oleaginous Trump hater. Back in
the primary, his game was to play the guilt by association gag on the
NRO blog. For instance, when NeverTrump loons claimed David Duke was a
Trumper, [Goldberg made the claim that Trump’s dismissal of it was proof
he was in the
KKK](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/432228/trump-thinks-kkk-are-conservative).
It is the oldest ploy. One lies and the other swears to it. That is
because the Progressive mind sees no clear line between the truth and a
lie. One is as good as the other, as long as it furthers the cause.

rel="noopener" target="_blank">You see that with this post from Jonah
Goldberg at National Review</a>. Ostensibly it is a post about sexual
misconduct. In reality, it is a game of moral equivalence so he can
denounce Roy Moore, a proxy for Trump.

Notice the slight of hand. Calling the Moore accusers credible is what
people in the business call a lie. The best you can say about some of
them is they are not obviously insane. The worst you can say about
Moore, is he wanted a young wife forty years ago when he was still a
relatively young man. Franken and Weinstein, in contrast, are admitted
degenerates. There is a mountain of corroborating evidence to support
the claims against them. Goldberg knows this, but he lies anyway,
because that serves the cause.

That is the thing to keep in mind with the neocons. Neoconservatism was
never a right-wing phenomenon. It was a Progressive heresy, and only a
very narrow one. Their dispute with the Progressives was never over
ideology. It was over tactics. The neocons wanted to aggressively wage
jihad against the Soviets. After the Cold War, they wanted to use the
American Empire to make the world safe for global Jewry. Otherwise, they
were perfectly fine with the Progressive social project, as long is it
did not harm the war effort.

This circles back to the way Chambers and Horowitz described their
thinking after they came out of the darkness. The neocons may have, out
of necessity, aligned with conservatives to achieve certain goals, but
they were always men of the Left. As such, they think like men of the
Left. That old habit of the ends justifying the means is still central
to who they are. It’s why a [Bill Kristol can manipulate his son-in-law
into conspiring with foreign
agents](http://www.lifezette.com/polizette/bill-kristols-son-in-law-i-hired-fusion-gps-in-primary/)
in the Never Trump conspiracy. Anything for the cause.

The funny thing about this is many neocons over the years have made this
argument about Progressives. Jonah Goldberg was fond of pointing out
that the Left was an ends justifies the means ideology, while the Right
was a means justifies the end ideology. That was just another lie to
further the cause. When the game is to trade away the culture for a free
hand in foreign affairs, they needed a way to explain away their failure
to conserve anything on the domestic front. Principled failure was the
answer.

The truth is, conservatism is the rejection of ideology, and therefore a
rejection of both sides of the neocon coin. Roy Moore, like Donald
Trump, is no one on the Right’s idea of the perfect candidate. There is
no such thing. Moore serves a purpose, faults and all, that no other
candidate serves. He will vote the right way on the important issues.
The same is true of Trump. He can be vexing, but he has a knack for
finding the best answer when it matters the most. That is conservatism.
Muddling through from one thing to the next.

Jonah Goldberg can never understand that.
