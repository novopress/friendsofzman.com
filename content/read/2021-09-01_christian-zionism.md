If you were to compile a list of the most influential people in history,
you would probably start with the most influential ideas. The people
responsible for inventing those ideas or popularizing them would be on
the list of influential people. Presumably, without those people, the
ideas would not have had the same level of impact. Marx would be on the
list because he came up with Marxism. Without Marx, it is hard to
imagine that branch of socialism developing as it has over 150 years.

Christian Zionism is an idea that does not get much attention, despite
the fact it has cast a long shadow over Western history. It is fair to
say that Zionism would not exist if not for the Christian Zionists. As
much as people like to talk about the influence of Jews and Judaism on
the West, it was Christians and a peculiar strain of Christianity that
made Zionism possible. In fact, the modern state of Israel probably owes
its existence to the hard work of Christian Zionist.

Christian Zionism has its roots in the Protestant Reformation. The
revolts against the Church gave rise to a wholesale reassessment of
Christian dogma. The distribution of the Bible in vernacular languages
allowed radical Protestants to interpret the scriptures in ways contrary
medieval Catholic tradition. Christian Zionism can be viewed as the
result of the democratization of Christianity. When every man could read
the Bible, ever man’s interpretation of Scripture was suddenly equal.

Restorationism was the Protestant idea that the Jews would eventually
return to Israel as part of the flow of history. Here you see the early
roots of this idea that history flows in one direction toward a
predictable end. With regards to the Jews, their return to Israel was
part of the end times. It did not take long before this evolved into a
belief that helping the Jews return was an essential part of
Christianity. Restoring Israel was the next logical step for this branch
of Christianity.

Picking the first Christian Zionist or even the most influential one is
difficult as the 19th century had many philosemitic Protestants. Of
course, all of them were relying on Puritan interpretation of Scripture,
so you can probably credit Oliver Cromwell with making it possible for
Christian Zionism to flourish. The British empire then spread the idea
around the world. Wherever English speaking people exist in large
numbers, you have fanatical support for Israel to this day.

The guy who should probably get credit for the invention of Zionism is
an Anglican clergyman named William Hechler. He was a rabid crusader
against antisemitism and the sponsor of Theodor Herzl, the founder of
modern Zionism. He called for the Jews to return to Palestine as a
pre-condition for the return of Jesus, which made the unconditional
support of Jews and Israel a core Christian belief. Overtime this has
evolved into unquestioned devotion to Israel.

Theodor Herzl could also get credit for Christian Zionism. After all, it
takes two to make a relationship and Herzl was the first Jewish Zionist.
If not for large swaths of the Jewish diaspora embracing the ideas of
the Christian Zionist, it is hard to imagine the movement lasting into
the 20th century. Even today, secular Jews despise Evangelical
Christians, in part, because of their support for Zionism. There are
other reasons, but the unbridled support of Israel and the restoration
is one element.

Even so, the creation of the Jewish state in the middle of the last
century was the product of Christian Zionism. Its existence has nurtured
and supported Christian Zionism, especially in America. In fact, much of
the spiritual fervor that would flow into Christian identity politics is
channeled into Zionism. In the cultural climate of the West, this is one
of the few safe ways for white people to cheer for their own side. You
can probably argue that Zionism relies on a form of white identity
politics.

Christian Zionism and Zionism would not exist without the strange form
of empire first invented by the British then perfected by Americans. The
British were the first ocean empire. The Greeks dominated the
Mediterranean, of course, but that is not the same as dominating oceans.
At the minimum, the British Empire was the first modern ocean empire.
Today, America controls the world because she controls the seas, which
means she controls the flow of goods globally.

It is hard to argue against Zionism as the most influential idea of the
20th century and now the 21st century. The creation of Israel by the
British in 1948 has focused the attention of the West on the Middle East
ever since. The long Cold War was entangled with Zionism which gave
birth to neoconservatism. The last thirty years has kept the American
empire obsessed with the fate of Israel. It is not unreasonable to say
that American foreign policy is controlled by the Israelis.

Step back and you can argue that Christian Zionism is the result of two
main forces unleashed in the West. One is the democratization of
Christianity. It is impossible to imagine Zionism flourishing within the
Catholic Church. The other is egalitarianism, the very Protestant idea
of equality. Without hierarchy, theology was turned over to the
entrepreneur, always looking for a novel way to sell Scripture. That is
how you get ideas like Restorationism or Mormonism.

Returning to where we started, if one was looking to compile a list of
great historical figures, you would have to include William Hechler on
that list. Even though his name is unfamiliar to the modern ear, his
influence is immense. If not for his tireless promotion of Theodor
Herzl, it is possible that Zionism was never born. Imagine what the
world would be like if Israel remained a concept, rather than a physical
reality. The last century would not be possible.
