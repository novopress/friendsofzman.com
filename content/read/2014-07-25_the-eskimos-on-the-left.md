Franz Boas is credited with originating the idea that the Eskimos have
an unusually large number of words for snow. The implication is that
they have an usually keen understanding of snow, due to being surrounded
by it most of the year. The accuracy of the claim is tangled up in a
much larger debate about language, culture and now, genetics and race.
In dissident circles, the

enjoying a bit of a renaissance for the same reason

An example is in <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/383667/thesaurus-synonyms-obstructionist-include-right-winger-rightist-tory-andrew-johnson"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this post</a> on National
Review.

*Apparently only conservatives and others on the right can be
obstructionists, according to Roget’s Thesaurus.*

*A search for synonyms of “obstructionist” on Thesaurus.com, which cites
Roget’s, reveals that the source considers several words related to
conservative and right-leaning political stances to fit the definition
of a “person who is cautious, moderate; an opponent of change.” Under
antonyms, it lists left-leaning words.*

*Included in the list of obstructionist synonyms are “right-winger,”
“right,” and “rightist” and ”Tory,”

*Other synonyms listed for obscrutionst are “traditionalist,”
“conserver,” “conventionalist,” “unprogressive,” and “redneck.”*

Here’s a screenshot of it.

Progressives have a long list of words for “bad.” Terms like “extreme”
and “right-wing” are lefty epithets clearly intended to mean “bad.” This
is whi it has become a gag on the right to call yourself an “extreme
right-wing extremist right-winger.” Another way to look at it is these
are all words that mean “outsider” to the hive-minded members of the
progressive cult.

<a
href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/21/merriam-webster-editor-apologizes-for-bigotry-association-to-conservatism-sort-of/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Howler has another
example</a>, this one from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

*In July,
we [learned](http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/13/heres-the-shocking-way-google-uses-bigotry-in-a-sentence/)
that a Google search of the word “bigotry” turned up a definition that
equated the word to “right-wing.” The sample sentence from the Oxford
Dictionary set off a small firestorm of anger by conservatives, who
don’t consider themselves bigoted and don’t think it should be part of
any dictionary definition of the word.*

*Well, it seems Merriam-Webster also thinks conservatives are bigots.*

*A review of Webster’s synonyms and antonyms section of the word reveals
the following:*

*In other words, liberals and progressives are the opposite of bigoted,
but anyone related to “conservatism” is.*

If you are a member of a cult, a hive or a tribe, knowing the boundaries
is all consuming. It is, after all, the boundaries that define you. It’s
why Jews, for example, look at Christians as a monolithic block. From
their perspective, they are just the the rival team. The atheists and
non-believers are mixed up in the undifferentiated other in way that
seem strange to Christians, who draw different boundaries.

For Progressives, we see the same siege mentality we see with Jews, the
former being irrational while the latter is rational. That’s an
important distinction. For the Left, all that matters is whether you are
inside the walls of the cult or outside the walls. The former is “one of
us” while the latter is the hostile undifferentiated other, for which
they have an endless supply of labels.

Note too that Progressive theology is greatly shaped by Judaism. It has
long been noted that <a
href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574402591116901498"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jews are wildly over
represented</a> on the Left. It is reasonable to assume that a lot Jews
getting together to create a political movement will end up leaving a
lasting impression on the resulting product. It’s why neo-conservatism
sounds like a weird combination of *tzedakah* and libertarianism.
