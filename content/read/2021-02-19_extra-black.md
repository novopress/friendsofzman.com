We are more than halfway through Black History Month and I realized I
had done nothing to celebrate the season. This week we remedy that with
a whole show on blackness and its traveling partner whiteness. That is
one of the things that gets missed in the rapidly evolving ethos of Jim
Snow America. The concept of whiteness can only exist in the presence of
non-whiteness, especially blackness. Without the juxtaposition with
non-whiteness, whiteness is no longer discernable.

This is not entirely by accident. Blackness, as has been discussed here
many times, is a negative identity. Black identity depends entirely on
the relationship between blacks and whites, real and imagined.
Everything about being black in America revolves around the black
relationship with whites. Remove whites from the equation and blackness
has no meaning. If whites pack up and leave, blacks will have to follow
them, as whites are their reason to exist now.

This is what the anti-whites are up to with whiteness. They are seeking
to make white identity a negative identity, dependent upon nonwhites.
The infamous anti-white tract, White Fragility, is about defining
whiteness in a negative light in objective terms, but also as something
wholly dependent on nonwhites. The pogrom against white parents and
their children in the New York City schools is another example. To be
white is all about the relationship with nonwhites.

Unlike blackness, whiteness can have no positive connotations.
Everything about being white is bad, according to our genocidal rulers.
Most important to white people, the only escape from the dark cloud of
whiteness is to remove all whiteness from society, which is simply a
call for genocide. Since all whites are guilty at birth, the only
logical solution to the whiteness problems is to kill whitey. Since many
of the people preaching this are white, it makes anti-whiteness
something like a suicide cult.

That is the missing piece to the puzzle. Nonwhites participate in these
antiwhite pogroms for personal gain and racial vengeance. The thing is
though, they would get nowhere in their efforts without whites at the
top of society supporting it. In fact, the driving force behind
anti-whiteness are white elites. They are not under a spell or being
tricked by a historically crafty. Anti-whiteness is the logical endpoint
for white people driven by self-loathing. It is the ultimate form of
self-abnegation.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
