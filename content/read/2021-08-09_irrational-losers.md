**Note:** The weekly
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/a-revolting-system/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. The topic this week
is something I hope to dive into on the podcast this week. The
revolution from above will be a new favorite phrase. There is also the
Sunday podcast up behind the

One of the distinguishing features of conservatism is the habit of
attacking its own side during conflicts with the Left. In fact, these
self-criticism sessions are usually triggered by left-wing criticism of
the Right or in anticipation of such criticism. Somewhere in the middle
of the fight, usually when things are looking up for the good guys,
conservatives will attack their own team over some small issue. The
claim is that the people in error are undermining the fight against the
left with their bad ideas.

A recent example is Heather MacDonald taking to the
[pages](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/covid-hysteria-contagious-among-conservatives/)
of a center-left platform to criticize vaccine skeptics as
knuckle-dragging primitives. You see, there are people opposed to the
Left who do not hold the same opinions as Heather MacDonald with regards
to the vaccines, so those people must be corrected. Sure, things are
going badly for the Left on the Covid issue but removing that fly from a
friend’s face with a hatchet is too important to wait until after the
fight.

There is no question that many people opposed to the strip-mining of
what is left of our liberties over the Covid issue are wrong about a lot
of things. Some think the vaccine changes your DNA. Some think the
vaccines are entirely fake, part of some plot to control society. If you
look hard enough, you can probably find people who think the vaccines
are an alien technology developed at Area 51. Covid is a ruse to
experiment on the public with this new extraterrestrial technology.

America is a big country, so you can find just about every crazy idea
imaginable if you look long enough. Why does Mx. MacDonald think these
people are worthy of a public tongue lashing? The stated reason is those
vaccine skeptics are acting as irrationally as the people they oppose.
Some of them think vaccines in general may not be all that safe and are
refusing this vaccine. Imagine that? People in the middle of a heated
partisan fight putting aside reason to score points against the enemy?

Presumably, Mx. MacDonald thinks these people are harming the cause in
some way, so they must be silenced. The claim appears to be reason. You
see, by tolerating the unreasonable on her side, it would harm her
claims to being the most reasonable person in the room. Therefore,
reason compels her to root around the ranks of the people opposed to the
Covid madness, looking for the unreasonable. Tone police the
unreasonable and then reason will triumph!

Of course, the question is, unreasonable to *whom?* Politics is always a
partisan business, so the central questions are *who?* and *whom?* Only
unreasonable people think politics can be a right answer business. In
most cases, there are many possible right answers, as right is
determined by preference. In a democracy, right is determined by
convincing the people wielding power behind the scenes that the mobs
will be sated with one approach or another. All politics is partisan.

Mx. MacDonald thinks these knuckle-dragging anti-vaxxers are making her
look bad to someone, so who is it? That is the key to understanding
conservative perfidy and failure over the last half century. What
matters most to them is the people in the managerial class and their
place in it. It is very important to someone like Mx. MacDonald to never
be associated with someone like Alex Jones, who thinks vaccines are
making frogs gay and lowering the sperm count of American males.

What reason tells us is that defeating the forces of darkness that have
launched the revolution from above is the only concern. If that means
siding with people who line their clothes with aluminum foil, so be it.
Nothing can come before the destruction of radicalisms in all its forms.
This is what reason demands. Otherwise, if the radicals get their way,
these people fetishizing their rationality will be keeping the rest of
us company in the reeducation camps.

Politics is an ugly business under ideal conditions, because people
inevitably assume that the other side of the fight is filled with bad
people. After all, they have the wrong opinions and refuse to change
them. That means things are said that are not true and not very nice
about the other side, but that’s just the nature of it. This is
something the people who never stop talking about their rationality
should know by now. Reasonable people understand the reality of the
human condition.

In the case of the Covid war, there are people making wild claims about
the vaccine, mostly to get attention for themselves. That is an argument
against social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These
platforms made it easy for stupid people to get on-line and have an
opinion. This drew in the sorts of people who look to exploit the mob
for their own benefit. This is also the argument against democracy, as
laid out in Federalist Papers 10, but here we are anyway.

The thing is, Alex Jones claiming the vaccine will alter your DNA is no
nuttier than much of what is in the mass media. In fact, a ridiculous
claim is far less harmful than the plausible, but inaccurate claim. Few
people will think the vaccine will turn you into Big Foot, but most
people will believe we need to make kids wear masks. Far more people
have been harmed by official lies than by goofballs on the internet.
Again, this is something the “rational conservatives” should understand.

None of this is to say that there can never be criticism of allies or
even a break with people who harm the cause. This has always been the
problem with outsider politics, which tends to get overrun with weirdos.
The issue is timing and intent. Privately chastising an ally for
screwing up is reasonable. Dismissing wackos who are harming the cause
is prudent. These are exceptions to partisanship that are required in
politics, but conservative have made them their purpose.

This is why conservatives always lose. The main principle of the
conservative is to conserve their reputation at all costs. No cause is
ever so dear as to lead them to spend a penny of their reputation on it.
Put another way, for the conservative, there is never anything worth
fighting for, so they are always willing to cede the battle to the other
side, no matter the cost. The Left sends thugs carrying bats and knives,
while the Right sends out dandies dressed like interior decorators.

The test in these matters is this. Is the world better or worse with a
small group of people who think vaccines alter your DNA? The obvious
answer is the world is not affected in the least by people with crackpot
ideas. Is the word made better or worse by allowing the evil of
progressivism triumph? The answer is obvious. People fetishizing their
rationality should be able to grasp this. Instead, for generations they
have come to the opposite conclusion and lost every fight.
