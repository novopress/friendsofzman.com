Summer is upon us, at least here in the United States, where Memorial
Day weekend is the unofficial start of the summer. Like a lot of you,
I’m looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend, so I decided to keep the
show light this week. I tried to stick to topics that were not too
serious. An important part of being in dissident politics is maintaining
a healthy sense of humor. Otherwise, you just make yourself miserable
and everyone around you miserable. If we’re doomed, at least we can
enjoy the ride.

That was something Milo Yiannopoulos mentioned toward the end of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHpvI8oGsuQ"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this interview</a> with Jordan
Peterson. He specifically said it was the intellectual dark web types
that lacked a sense of humor, but it applies to everyone on the other
side of the great divide. Left-wing Progressives are vinegar drinking
scolds, while so-called conservatives are too frightened to notice
anything. Humor starts with noticing. A big part of what happens on this
side of the great divide is noticing the ridiculousness of the age.

Milo appears to be ready for a comeback, which is probably not a
terrible thing, assuming he learned from his mistakes. In that interview
he does appear a bit chastened, but that could just be part of the act.
When he is not talking about his imaginary self and sticks to the topic,
he is quite effective. The trouble is he can’t stop talking about
himself and his “self” is always some character he created to hide his
real self from view. This affliction never ends well for performers.

Not having paid much attention to Jordan Peterson, I found his act a bit
amusing. I’m old enough to remember when being a psychologist was a
glamour job. Television shows often featured that as a profession. Then
real science started to crowd out psychology and it stopped being cool.
Watching Peterson, I was having flashbacks to being a kid watching TV
and wondering why anyone thought you could talk someone out of being
insane. The psychologist is the witch doctor of this age.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
