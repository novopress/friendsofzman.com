Toiling in the fields yesterday, it occurred to me that this weekend may
be the last time I get to hang out with the great John Derbyshire. The
only public events he does these days are VDare events and this may be
the final one of those due to the lawfare they have suffered through for
the last few years. John is also nearing the time when retirement is on
the agenda.

Oddly, Derb does not get much credit for being the first right-wing
podcaster way back in the before times. When he was at National Review,
he started doing his show and it was a novelty at the time. After a
while, many others got into the game, often copying the style used by
Derb. The “review of and comment upon the news” podcast format remains a
staple of the podcast ecosystem.

You can also credit Derb for coining the term “dissident right” back
around the same time he launched his podcast. The concept was largely in
response to the nutty neocon-evangelical conservatism of the Bushies.
Unlike Gottfried’s “alternative right”, the dissident right started from
empirical truths about the human condition. Dissident right has outlived
alternative right, at least for now.

We spend a lot of time thinking about what went wrong and who is
responsible for what went wrong, but it is good to think about what went
right too. One thing that prevents the dispossessed from falling into
despair is the network of dissident audio content that reminds us that
we are not alone. The show this week is a tribute, in the tribute band
sort of way, to the guy who kicked off the dissident podcast space.
