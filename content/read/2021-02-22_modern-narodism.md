The political reactionary is an essential component of left-wing
mythology, going back to the French Revolution. In fact, most
reactionaries are an invention of Left, so they always have an enemy. It
is why they tend to go on murder sprees once they gain control of the
institutions. The hunt for counter revolutionaries and running dog
reactionaries provides fuel for permanent revolution. Once the
revolution runs out of enemies, the revolution loses energy and
collapses in on itself.

Even though the term reactionary has been abused by the Left, used as a
slur against critics and opponents, it does not mean there are no
reactionaries. The Thermidorian Reaction was a real thing. The
Restoration of the French monarchy was, in part, a reactionary
development. The restoration of the monarchy after the death of Cromwell
could be classified as a reactionary event. After all, Charles II did
order the body of Cromwell to be disinterred and displayed in chains.

While the Left owns the term, political reaction is not just a
right-wing phenomenon nor is it strictly political. It can be argued
that socialism and communism are reactions to the Industrial Revolution.
After all, it was the Marxist who popularized the term. It was an 19th
century pejorative for the current state of the world at the time.
Various forms of socialism were a reaction to the sudden growth of a new
class, who gained their wealth and power through the acquisition of
industrial capital.

Narodism, which was a socialist movement in pre-revolutionary Russia,
was a reaction to both the rise of capital and tsarism. The Narodniks,
as they were called at the time, were a form of agrarian socialism
rooted in the idea that the wealth of Russia was in the peasantry and
small craftsman in the countryside. Initially, they were a reaction to
the size and scale of the tsarist system of rule. They soon evolved into
a reaction to the growing power of capital, just like other socialists
of the age.

The interesting thing about the Narodniks is they were more than just a
political or economic movement. They were a cultural movement as well.
Faced with the sheer size of the tsarist system and the rapid cultural
changes promised by the growth of industry, their response was to go
back to the cultural roots of the people. The term Narodism comes from
the word “narod”, a word equivalent to *volk,* which is a term familiar
to most on the dissident right.

This is something relevant to this age. The technological revolution has
allowed the managerial state to grow into something inconceivably
massive. We live in an age in which there is little privacy. The eyes of
the system are everywhere, even in our homes and in our private
conversations. There is no way to escape the unblinking eye of the
surveillance state. One force behind the current unrest is the growing
sense that all of us are subject to the unwanted gaze of the managerial
state.

Another aspect is the rise of the new class. Like the sudden appearance
of the capital class in the industrial revolution, we suddenly have a
new powerful class that gained its power and wealth through the capture
of information. This new class did not get rich by building a better
mouse trap. They got rich capturing an information bottleneck or a
monopoly of some information service. Michael Bloomberg literally got
rich from a monopoly on information to the financial service sector.

Another parallel to the Narodniks we are seeing is the “back to the
people” approach by the various tribes on the dissident right. The
Narodniks adopted the traditional clothing of the rural people and
worked hard to portray themselves as the vanguard of the authentic
Russian people. We see something like that on the dissident right. There
is a desire to return to a more authentic way of living, rooted in local
community. Like the Narodniks, the dissident right is more cultural than
political.

The thing is though, the argument in favor of the Narodniks being
reactionary falls apart when you look at their overall goals. They may
have wanted to “return to the people” in a cultural and spiritual sense,
but they did not want to return to a past system. Their program was a
departure from the past and present. A proper way to describe what they
imagined was something like a return to a point in the past and a
do-over back to this point, but with a different set of choices.

This is something that kicks around the dissident right. There is an
understanding that there is no going back. Even if you could restore
things back to some point in the past when things were better, the roots
of the present lie in that past. Liberal democracy is the fruit of
American history. A do-over would most likely lead us right back to
where we are now. In this regard, modern dissidents are more realistic
than the Narodniks in that there is no idealized past or population at
the center.

In this regard, civic nationalism is closer to modern reaction. They
have created an idealized and largely fictional past. It was a series of
innovation by their enemy that sent the country off course. They believe
that if we just return to “our constitutional principles” everything
will magically get back on the righteous path. Not only do they want to
rip the past seventy years from the history books, but they would also
like to remove all of the history that makes their imagined past
plausible.

One last note on the Narodniks relative to this age. For the most part,
the movement was a failure in that it failed to achieve any of its
goals, other than the assassination of the Tsar in 1881. Their effort to
educate and train the peasantry into a revolutionary force was a
failure. The Narodniks were mostly urban intellectuals who had no
understanding of the peasants. The assassination of the Tsar lost them
whatever support they had among the people.

What they did, however, is lay the groundwork for what came next. Their
idea of building an alternative base of power outside the system was
adopted by 20th century revolutionary movements. Their tactics also
informed others. Their organizational style and use of small group
tactics were also a forerunner. Their ideas on generating debate outside
what was allowed was an important contribution. They understood that the
people needed to be reconditioned before they could challenge the
system.

This is the final parallel to modern dissidents. Much of what goes on in
dissident politics is a debate about challenging the prevailing
orthodoxy. While we do not have peasants in the traditional sense, we do
have them in a spiritual sense. Rewiring how they think of themselves
and the system that created them, the “converting normie” thing, is an
important part of dissident politics. Like the Narodniks, this must
happen in small groups using non-traditional tactics to work around the
system.

This is why the Narodniks and modern dissidents would fall outside the
traditional definition of reactionary. The initial energy is a reaction
to the changes in the culture brought about by rapid innovation, but
there is no desire to return to the past. Instead, these movements are
pre-reactionary and proto-revolutionary, a transition phase in the
response to the current age. Dissident politics is a rejection of the
modern and what created it, with a vague understanding of what comes
next.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
