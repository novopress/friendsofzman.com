**Note:** This coming Thursday I will be on with the great Ed Dutton to
explain to him that intelligence is a social construct used to defend
white supremacy. The livestream is on the

replay on

posted here.

If you were a typical European in the 17th century, you would not have
been brimming with optimism. Life was tough for most people in that age
because the margin for error was so small. If you made a wrong step
behind the plow, you could break a leg and before long some guy is
sawing off your leg to stop gangrene. Knock over a candle on the way to
the latrine and your hut could burn down. Disaster was always lurking as
even small things could quickly turn deadly.

If you were educated, material life was usually better, but being
educated in an age of general ignorance is a special sort of curse. If
you were an educated man in the 17th century, you knew about the Thirty
Years War, so you were not all that optimistic about the intellectual
future of mankind. Parts of Europe were reduced to cannibalism in an
effort to hang onto antiquated modes of thought and order. Few people
saw them as antiquated, which meant grinding war was normal.

Despite this, the West was on the cusp and the Enlightenment. Most
people date the dawn of the period of Western intellectual flowering
that is still with us today to around the start of the 18th century.
Galileo was a man of the 17th century and Nicolaus Copernicus was a man
of the 16th century. James Harrington published The Commonwealth of
Oceana in 1656. As with any era in human history, pinpointing an exact
starting point is mostly out of convenience, not accuracy.

The point here is that for most people alive in the 17th century, these
intellectual stirrings were unknown. Even educated people were limited
by the circumstances of the age as the dissemination of information was
by foot. The printing press had revolutionized the production of books,
but books were still expensive. Of course, most of the best and
brightest were Thomist, so the new ideas from science would have looked
like a threat to the natural order.

Of course, the political outlook was grim. The Peace of Westphalia had
settled the Thirty Years War, but the underlying issues remained. The
division of the world into Protestant and Catholic suggested eternal
conflict. The English Civil War suggested that religious conflict within
the Protestant side was inevitable. The great unity of faith maintained
by the Catholic Church was forever broken. A reasonable, educated man
could easily foresee a dark future for mankind.

It is a good reminder that we are not very good at judging the times in
which we are living or seeing around the next bend. The cynical in the
17th century had no idea that the 18th century would be an unprecedented
intellectual flowering. It was not all kittens and puppies, for sure,
but in the rubble of war and upheaval were the seeds of a great leap
forward intellectually and materially. No one living at the time knew
that the birth of modern Europe was just over the next hill.

We could be in a similar period. Like the 17th century, this age looks
like it is headed to endless conflict and barbarism. The old order is
falling to pieces and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">random lunatics</a> pop up with new religions. Just as
17th century man struggled to come to terms with what was happening,
people in this age struggle to make sense of it all. Ours is an age of
pointless chaos, often created by the people in charge, who should be
the most aggressive defenders of the old order.

Like the 17th century, what lies at the root of the chaos is a
collection of new ideas and new questions about the world. Genetics is
promising to give us new insights into the nature of man. More
important, it is threatening the old ideas about equality and the power
to shape society. Extreme egalitarianism and the blank slate lie at the
heart of the liberal democratic order. Questioning those concepts
questions the legitimacy of the current political order in the West.
Revolutionary stuff.

Like the printing press, the information age is threatening the flow of
information in unpredictable ways. Much of the current crisis lies in
the realization by the ruling elites that the people no longer take
their word for anything. The natural authority that comes from the
monopoly on information has been shattered. Lots of gentlemen scholars
and part-time intellectuals are now challenging the definitions of those
terms by spending their free time reading forbidden material on-line.

The 17th century was a revolutionary time, even though the people living
in it did not realize they were at the cusp of a revolution. The
expression about bankruptcy being slow and then all of a sudden applies
to revolutions as well. Angry mobs in the streets are lagging indicators
of revolution. Long before the masses raise the black flag and declare
war on their rulers, clever men privately declared war on the ideas that
gave the rulers their legitimacy. This is what we see today.

Like the people in 17th century, we now find ourselves in a time when
the old order is desperately trying to adapt to new information. It is
easy to forget that revolutionary thinkers like Locke and Hobbes were
trying to adapt the old models of thought to the new information of
their age. In other words, even the defense of order can be a
revolutionary act that expedites challenges to the status quo. We see
this today as people try to make science prove the blank slate.

There is always the possibility that we get at the macro level the
equivalent of the peasant knocking over a lantern on the way to the
toilet. The hysterical response to the plague and suicidal impulses of
the new religion are ominous signs. The flicker of this new
enlightenment could easily be extinguished by madman with super weapons
destroying civilization to save democracy. History, however, tells us
that this is not the way to bet. Instead, we are on the cusp of a new
enlightenment.
