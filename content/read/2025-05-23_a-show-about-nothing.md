This weekend is the official launch of summer in America. It does not
feel like the first weekend of summer, but that is probably due to the
weather. It has been cool and rainy here for most of spring. Even so, it
is the start of the summer season. That means the A-list fabricators
will be taking off, leaving the media mendacity to the second string for
the next few months. The quality of lies will be low.

It will be interesting to see if the Trump admin maintains the pace. The
last four months has been a whirlwind. This week we got the South Africa
stuff, which is one of those things that no one thought possible six
months ago. The Overton window is moving so quickly it is hard to keep
up with it. Now that official Washington is heading off for the summer,
it will be interesting to see if the admin takes a break

The other thing to watch for this summer is if the crazies get brought
out of storage to riot somewhere. If you scan Bluesky, they are
depressed. The money dried up and then the jobs dried up. Now they are
left to trade scare stories to one another in the weird echo chamber
that is Bluesky. If it is an Orange Man Summer, the fever swamp could be
on suicide watch by August.

Normally there would not be a show this week, as the Friday before a
holiday weekend is a good time for a break. I had some time to kill, so
I threw something together that was light and not too taxing. It is a
good time to relax and not think about the madness of this age, so the
show is easy listening. I hope everyone has a wonderful Memorial Day
weekend and thank you for reading and listening.
