I thought I would take a break from the money game this week to address
an issue that comes up in the email from time to time. That issue is my
ideology. Whenever I comment upon ideology, almost always in a negative
way, I get comments suggesting I should explain my ideology, rather than
just criticize others. Certain nationalists take issue with being called
ideologues for some reason.

The trouble with this is I am not an ideologue, but I thought that might
make for a good show, so that was the plan this week. Then as I was
recording it, I started having issues with my voice, like I am getting a
cold. That threw me off my game and the show wandered around a bit. I
would have scrapped it and started over, but I was not sure if the pipes
would make it, so I stuck with the first pass.

Realism and pragmatism are much abused terms in American politics. The
people we call the right often claim to be on the side of realism, but
that is not so. They are just a slower version of those they claim to
oppose. The people we call the left used to love the term pragmatism,
despite being fanatics. There is a good chance they dust off that
language in time for the next election.

Realism and pragmatism are not the opposite of ideology. Ideology does
not have an opposite unless you consider the absence of ideology as the
opposite. No society is devoid of a moral framework, which either turns
up in the dominant religion of the people or as a set of customs and
traditions. Ideology is an attempt to replace both religion and
tradition with a new moral framework.

The realist understands that ideology is a shabby replacement for
religion and tradition, no matter how muted the goals. Pragmatism
demands that any political program operate within the limits of the
organic moral order of the people. The realist sees things as they are
and wonders why, while ideologues dream of things that can never be and
demands we explain why not. He never accepts the answer.

That is the show this week. The first half is the problem with ideology,
but specifically the American ideology. I even talk about the L. Ron
Hubbard of the American ideology, Leo Strauss a bit. One of these days I
will do a show on Strauss, but I do not find him as interesting as his
followers find him. The rest of the show is why I think I naturally
reject ideology. Not a great show, but you get what you pay for.
