Was Jesus rational? If you are a modern Christian, this is a question
that probably sounds intentionally offensive or unintentionally
ignorant. It suggests the person asking the question thinks Jesus was
insane. Calling Jesus a crazy person therefore could sound deliberately
provocative. On the other hand, someone asking the question could simply
be ignorant. Only someone unfamiliar with Scripture or Christian
theology could suggest that God’s only son was a lunatic.

This is not a question that would have offended early Christians,
however, because they had a different relationship with faith and
reason. The gods of the ancient world were not the defenders of logic
and reason. Often, the gods were the greatest offenders of logic and
reason, using tricks and magic to bring down the hero, even though the
hero was acting rationally. After all, the tragic hero is often the man
who does the rational things but is brought low despite his reason.

The ancients did not look at reason like modern man. They had to solve
problems like all humans, but they did not worship reason like a god. In
fact, reason was often viewed as a hinderance to understanding the gods.
Understanding the gods and their relationship to man started with the
understanding that the gods operated outside of the rationality of
mankind. They had their rules, man had his rules, and the story of man
was the interplay between these two worlds.

Of course, there was that sense that the fate of men and the individual
man was controlled by things beyond human comprehension. It was not just
the capricious gods who tripped up men, but that sense that there was
something else going on to determine the outcome of life, something that
was well outside the domain of man, a thing called fate. Just as the
tragic hero was undone by fate, the hero was the man who recognized and
submitted to his fate.

For most of human history, the key to making any sense of life was in
accepting the mystery of the natural world and man’s place in it. That
acceptance never meant understanding it, much less conquering it. The
natural world was not a thing to be conquered or even challenged. It was
a thing to be accepted. Therefore, for the early Christians, the
irrationality of Jesus and his life would have made far more sense to
them than the far more rational version of this age.

The phrase, “Athens and Jerusalem”, which turns up in certain parts of
American conservatism has its roots in this question about the
rationality of Jesus. The second century Christian writer Tertullian
famously asked, “what has Athens to do with Jerusalem” in response to
those trying to make sense of faith. The absurdities within the story of
Jesus are what gives power to faith, because the truly faithful believe
the message despite the absurdities.

As an aside, “Athens and Jerusalem” was <a
href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/leo-strauss/jerusalem-and-athens-some-introductory-reflections/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">reintroduced</a> to us by Strauss, who
used it for a series of lectures and essays. No one knows what he meant
by it as the main project of his students is to make themselves and
their mentor as incomprehensible as possible on the assumption that
“Straussian” is code for incoherent. Others have picked up the phrase as
a way of weaving their ancestors into your family tree, thus making
Western civilization the fruit of the Greeks and the Jews.

It is debatable as to whether Strauss clipped this phase from Tertullian
in order to open the gates to ideas outside of Christianity. In the
hands of lesser minds, it has led to idiotic concepts like
“Judeo-Christian.” Tertullian would have happily lit the fire underneath
the heretics promoting such an idea. Like the other Christian writers of
his age, he was hostile to the Jews and wrote polemics against them. For
their part, the Jews have <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/christian-in-israel/comment/targeted-by-tertullian-321512"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">never forgiven</a> him for it.

That aside, there is little doubt that Christianity, as it spread
throughout Europe, became a vehicle to introduce Greek thought to
Europe. Not only did the Church preserve and reproduce ancient works,
including the Greeks, it began to absorb the rationality that Tertullian
would have found difficult in the organization of the Church and its
relationship with the secular authorities that evolved in the Middle
Ages. The irrationality of faith planted the seeds of the rational
rejection of faith.

Therein lies the problem for the modern Christian. He has grown up in a
world that worships reason to the exclusion of mystery. The point of
human thought is to locate every mystery and strip from it all of its
irrationality, so that it is reduced to a mechanism explained by
mathematics. Reason is the hunter who poses with his kill for a picture
he can use on his internet profile, because the beauty he sees in the
image is him posing next to the kill, not the bit of nature he
harvested.

The Christian who bristles at the “absurdity” the question posed at the
beginning is a Christian forced to explain faith by the rules of reason.
It is a hopeless project, which is why the churches have emptied out
across the West. If the churches are to fill up again or new churches
are to be founded, the modern Christian must confront the fact that the
god of this age is rationality. That god must be overcome in order to be
restored to his proper place alongside the mystery of life.
