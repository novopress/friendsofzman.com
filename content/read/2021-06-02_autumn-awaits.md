One of the most fascinating things about any revolution is the mistakes
made by all sides leading up to the revolution. The errors of the people
in charge tend to be the most obvious, as the winners focus on them as
justification. “The king did this, so we had no choice but to do that”
is the formula. Objective analysis usually reveals that the motives of
the ruler and the revolutionaries were far less coherent. In retrospect,
revolutions tend to look like a series of massive blunders.

The reason, of course, is that both sides of the fight tend to see the
other side as a black box. They only see the actions of the other side,
without understanding the motives or reasoning. With limited evidence,
they fashion explanations that tend to be self-serving and petty. The
aristocracy in France could have done a lot of things to head off
disaster, but instead they made one error after another. From the
outside, what was driven by ignorance appeared to be driven by malice.

There is a cascading effect in revolutions. The initial conditions that
lead to general unhappiness soon give way to anger over specific events.
One group gets angry over something, and they no longer see the ruler as
reasonable. Then another event triggers different people and before long
every event adds to the avalanche of unrest. In between, there seems to
be some calming, but in reality, it is just the energy building up for
another burst of anger and frustration at the next event.

We may be in one of those periods of calm. The dropping of the Covid
nonsense and the start of summer has people thinking of things other
than politics, despite the signs that this summer will be ugly in many
ways. Soaring prices for food and fuel are always bad omens, bit so far
people seem to be ignoring them. Similarly, the building crime wave is
not getting much attention. Antiwhite violence is already a problem, but
white people seem to be looking past it for now.

Even if the revolution takes a holiday this summer, there are a couple
of big storm clouds on the horizon. Both are Supreme Court cases. The
first one is an abortion case, *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization.* This will take up the question of the constitutionality
of a 2018 Mississippi state law that bans abortions after the first 15
weeks of pregnancy. People who claim to know about these things believe
the court could overturn or sharply limit *Roe v. Wade*.

The other case is a gun case. The court, in *NY State Rifle & Pistol
Assoc. v. Corlett*, will review a New York law that requires individuals
to get a license to carry a concealed gun outside the home. In *District
of Columbia v. Heller* the court ruled that the Second Amendment
provides an individual right to keep a handgun at home for self-defense
but did not address the carry issue. Many think the courts will rule
that carrying a firearm is equally protected by the Second Amendment.

If one were to identify two key beliefs of American civic nationalism,
one would be faith in the courts to enforce the Constitution, if we get
the right judges in place. The other is faith in the Second Amendment as
the ultimate backstop. The whole purpose to voting for so-called
conservatives is to eventually get a court that will strike down many of
the left-wing programs, like abortion. Along the same lines, that same
court will affirm the Second Amendment, thus ensuring people will never
fear their government.

There is a good bet that the court rules against the civic nationalist
position on both of these issues in the fall. The abortion case is the
most likely shock to the system, as this was the reason to support
Trump. He stacked the court with his people and now they are supposed to
deliver. The Christian conservatives ignored Trump’s rather obvious
personal failings because he promised to deliver judges. He did his part
and now the judges have to live up to their end of the bargain.

History says they will find a way to fink on the people. In theory, it
is a 6-3 court, but John Roberts has miraculously transformed into Ruth
Bader Ginsberg, so it is really a 5-4 court again. Gorsuch is the most
likely to find a reason to vote with the far-left. He has already found
a way to fink on his side. In *Bostock v. Clayton County*, Gorsuch wrote
the <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">majority opinion</a> granting men in
dresses special rights. It is not hard to image him flipping to the
far-left on this abortion case as well.

The gun case is a bit different, as the court could find some technical
problem with prior rulings and send it back for rehearing. It is also
not the radical change that the abortion case presents. Extending
*Heller* to include carrying a firearm outside the home will have no
impact on most of the country. Still, given the nature of Washington, it
is not hard to imagine a similar dynamic as the abortion case. This time
it would be Barrett siding with the far-left, sighting some nonsense
about black victimization.

The regime has already begun to let the court know that they better rule
the correct way, or their will be consequences. Senator Blumenthal from
Connecticut is the first out of the gate <a
href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/01/jonathan-turley-richard-blumenthal-threaten-supreme-court/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">threatening</a> the judges. It will not
be long before he is joined by other prominent Democrats, as well as the
media. Then you have the extortion rackets run by the FBI and other
players. The odds of the court ruling in favor of the civic nationalist
position are very low, but their expectations are very high.

This is shaping up to be one of those unforced regime mistakes that seem
to characterize every revolution. The abortion case in particular is the
one that could radicalize a lot of civic nationalists. Christian
conservatives are already on the edge, given the overtly anti-Christian
pogroms run by the ruling class. If the court finks on them in the fall,
it could be the last straw. They will conclude that there is no path
forward in conventional politics and begin to organize outside of the
system.

Predicting the future is always a mugs game, but history says that the
regime does not miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The
combination of paranoia and partisan hatred keeps leading them to the
wrong decision. The wise move would be to give the people a win in the
courts on these issues, but wisdom requires wise men, and the ruling
class is desperately short of them. Instead, the regime will be
dispensing truckloads of red pills to civic nationalists when the court
returns in the fall.
