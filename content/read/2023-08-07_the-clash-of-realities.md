------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a scenario in which there are two people talking. Person A says,
“I am very thirsty” and Person B responds, “There is a store around the
corner.” Now imagine a member of the secret police reading these lines
in a transcript without any other information about the people. Stripped
of all context, these sentences do not mean anything, and they are not
obviously connected to one another. They could easily be viewed as
random sentences or perhaps coded messages.

Of course, both Person A and Person B would understand the exchange
because the receiver of the first message had a lot of other
information. Maybe he knew that Person A had been exercising or that it
was a hot day. That is why he mentioned that there was a store around
the corner. Of course, Person A understood the response because he knew
that Person B understood what he meant. These sentences made sense to
both parties because of shared knowledge.

As an aside, secret messages work the same way. The messages are
designed to make sense only within a specific context. The sender
assumes the receiver will have the key that provides the context. Often,
the key is the context that makes the messages intelligible. To someone
without the key, the message is meaningless gibberish. In more
sophisticated codes, the receiver needs the key as well as the larger
context of the message.

Getting back to the example, that exchange is something called the
cooperative principle, a concept from linguistics. The parties in a
casual conversation rely upon a commonly held set of assumptions. In
most situations, the listeners and speakers act cooperatively to
facilitate communication. They mutually accept one another to be
understood in a particular way. There is an assumed base of shared
information upon which their exchange rests.

This describes the cooperate principle of communication. The four maxims
of this principle are quantity, quality, relation, and manner. Quantity
is the amount of information communicated to the other parties. The
quality of that information is the truthfulness of what is being
communicated. Relevance is the relationship of the information to the
topic or situation. Manner is the clarity of communication.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Grice’s maxims</a> explain how people efficiently
communicate to one another.

This structure for how people communicate is vitally important in a
society in which the people are expected to participate in the governing
of society. In a monarchy, horizontal relationships are subordinate to
the vertical social structures. One does not have to understand the king
in order to understand the relationship. The customs and social
structures provide most of what the king would ever need to communicate
to the people and what the people need to communicate to one another.

In other words, in an aristocratic system, the context so dominates the
daily life of the people that verbal communication is reduced to the
pragmatic. There is no need to discuss, much less debate abstract
concepts that require lots of additional information in order to make
sense to the participants. In a democracy, those clear social structures
are gone and what must replace them is a large common understanding.
Everyone has to operate from the same set of truths and assumptions.

This gets to why America is in such an agitated state, despite the
relative peace and prosperity of the age. The people in charge seem like
they are not just speaking a different language but doing so from a
different reality. That is because for the most part, they are using a
different language and they do operate in a different world from the
bulk of the people. The managerial class is defined by the managerial
elite and therefore operates by a different cooperative principle.

Take the word “democracy” which is used all the time by the regime. To
normal people, this means majority rule. In a democracy, the government
does what the majority of the people want, with some exceptions. Normal
people accept that some things like slavery are not up for debate. Even
if the majority wants to bring back slavery, it is an immoral practice,
so it is not permitted. Otherwise, normal people assume democracy is the
will of the people expressed in the laws.

To the managerial elite, democracy means the process by which the
majority or an assumed majority is convinced to support elite opinion.
This is why they are inspired to redouble their efforts whenever they
lose at the ballot box. Democracy requires them to work harder to get
their desired result. Expediency may require them to go around this
process using the courts or administrative fiat. The assumption is that
enough people already agree so it is close enough to justify action.

This one word shows how the elite and the commoners do not share the
same basis of understanding when it comes to politics. The elites see
democracy as the process of working toward their desired end. The people
assume it is the process by which elites discover the common will. These
are two entirely different and incompatible views of the democratic
process. Inevitably this leads to a large number of words and concepts
lacking a shared understanding.

More critically, the managerial elite deliberately flouts the principle
of commonality to trick the people into supporting the opposite of what
they desire. Normal people are used to flouting the principle of
commonality, as it is a central part of comedy, as in sarcasm or satire.
The managerial elite, however, violates the principle in order to trick
the common people, but also to signal intent to the rest of the elite.
It is why every new social fad comes with new insider jargon.

The regularized flouting of the principle of commonality in political
discourse is not entirely due to deceit, even though it is often a happy
accident. The managerial elite in particular, but the managerial class
in general, lives in a different shared reality than the people over
whom they rule. More important, the managerial class is increasingly
aware of the class difference. Much of what defines the ruling class is
the shared knowledge of the difference between them and the rest.

This is why political discourse is increasingly frustrating, but also
pointless. The gap between how the media, for example, talks about the
Trump indictments and how normal people talk about it is too large to
cross. The shared reality of the media imagines Trump leading an armed
rebellion against the system. The shared reality of the normal people is
of a man being tormented by the ruling elite. There is no commonality
here, so the communication is cognitively meaningless.

What this suggests is that the clash between the rulers and the ruled is
much more than a clash of interests. It is not simply about one side
wanting different ends than the other side or wanting more from the
result than the other side. Those sorts of conflicts rest on a set of
commonly accepted principles. This clash is due to the managerial class
living in a different contextual reality from the people. The current
conflict is not a clash of interests, but a clash of incompatible
realities.
