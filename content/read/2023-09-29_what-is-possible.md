It is fair to say that political philosophy, as we currently think it,
is the search for the ideal or best form of government. Even now, at the
end of history, when all of the best people are sure we have figure out
that “our democracy” is the ideal form of government, there are heretics
thinking about what could be better. It is hard to image what could be
better than “our democracy” but they are imagining it.

Of course, even the best people must concede that there must be
something better as otherwise there could be no progress. The only way
we stop progress is by reaching the end of time which is the perfection
human society. Once we reach that point, no one will imagine there can
be anything better, so there is no longer a need for political science,
political philosophy or even politics.

While we are progressing toward something, it very clearly is not the
perfection of mankind and human society. Instead we are ruled by
lunatics and simpletons hellbent on smashing what is left of Western
society. The more likely answer to what comes next is chaos and then
some effort to impose order. Therefore the question of political science
will be what sort of order is possible.

What form of government is possible with the demographics we have and
will have in the not too distant future? Will it be possible to have a
general answer to that question for all regions of North America. Lilly
white Vermont will have very different answers than highly diverse
Georgia. Mexifornia cannot have the same answers as New England or
states in the black belt.

One answer is that there is no system that can provide order, at least
with the ingredients that we have in terms of people, history, geography
and so on, so those will have to change. This is the recipe for civil
war. The result of that process will then frame what is possible with
what remains. The political questions then become, what is possible and
what must happen to have tolerable options.
