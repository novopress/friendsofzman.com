Every cult has defense mechanism. It is the nature of all organic things
to have some way to protect themselves from assault by predators and
competitors. Religions are organic things, even the ones cooked up by
bored science fiction writers. They quickly evolve into something that
has a nature different from the sum of its parts. Secrets, rituals and
practices that define who is in and who is out of the group are an
essential defense mechanism.

Because Progressives lack consecrated buildings in which to meet and
spread the good word, they have developed an elaborate way to signal to
one another their membership in the cult. These change over time as the
Cult of Modern Liberalism is occasionalist. In the 80’s, male adherents
wore linen collars and had floppy JFK hairdos. Today they have 90’s
dance club beards and wear fake glasses.

The preferred defense mechanism of the Cult of Modern Liberalism is the
shifting of focus from it to some conjured bogeyman. Defining that
bogeyman, therefore, is an important part of the daily life of the true
believer. For the lesser lights, the “what to do about Grendel” becomes
their reason to exist. The bogeyman becomes the all-consuming issue.

As to the post in question, it’s a good example of a common feature with
moonbats. They have a lot of words for “other” that they liberally
employ as epithets. The word “racist” has magical qualities because it
can be applied to anyone they don’t like at the moment. This quiz is
basically just a list of things this poor deranged women thinks are bad
at the moment.

The other thing that you see here and with all moonbats is the use of
insider language to suggest they hold a special place in the cult. Ms.
Grattan used “WoC” not because it is explanatory, but to indicate she is
inside while you are outside. No doubt other moonbat women in her coven
congratulated her for the use of “WoC” in her post. This whole effort,
after all, was just a public act of piety. Getting the pat on the head
is the point.

The thing about wackos like Grattan is she invests a lot of her time
blocking people on social media and shouting down people who hold
opinions she does not like. Her test is not about testing your degree of
racism. It is about closing off any discussion of the topic. It’s
settled and unless you agree it is settled, you’re a bad person.

The strangest thing about people like Grattan is she is a colossal
hypocrite. She rails about racism, but lives in an all-white
neighborhood. When she was arrested for stalking her boyfriend, it was
in one of the richest and best guarded and most white parts of Chicago.
If she wanted to be down with the cause, she could move to any of the
city’s ghettos, but that’s not going to happen.
