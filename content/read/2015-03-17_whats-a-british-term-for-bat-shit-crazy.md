*A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of sending a racist tweet
aimed at Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck.*

*The post was made after Welbeck netted the winning goal during an FA
Cup quarter-final clash against his former club Manchester United on 9
March.*

*Manchester-born Welbeck joined the Gunners for £16m last summer.*

*The 15-year-old boy, from the Salisbury area, was arrested on suspicion
of racial abuse and released on bail until 13 April, Wiltshire Police
said.*

I’m not a a free speech absolutist. I think people make a fetish over
so-called free speech in order to avoid discussing freedom of
association. I argue that freedom of association solves the modern
problems of speech. In this case, the people who found the speech of the
teenager offensive should have the right to ignore it. Problem solved.

Given the hysterical nature of anti-racism, it is no surprise that it
leads to the policing of thought and speech. Anti-racism has been called
a theodicy by some on the DR, but that is not quite right. The
proponents are not trying to reconcile their conception of the
supernatural with reality. They are trying to reconcile Rousseau-ism
with reality. We need a new word.

That said, the religious become more fanatical when faced with
dis-confirmation or an existential threat. Islam has lurched into lunacy
in the face of the cultural encroachment of the West. Anti-racists have
a tough time because humans are biologically racist. We are hard wired
to cling to our kin and then those who resemble our kin.

The communications revolution has accelerated the decent into madness
because it brings the anti-racist in contact with a tidal wave of
reality. Rather than reconsider, the fanatic sees dis-confirmation as
proof they must re-double their efforts. If that means rounding up
children for the crime of hurting the feelings of a sports star, so be
it.
