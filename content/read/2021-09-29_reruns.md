Long before the cock crows I am out and on the road to a secret meeting,
so I am unable to post as usual. Instead, here is the paywall podcast
that I do on Sunday and post up on SubscribeStar. Those supporting the
cause will have no doubt listened and memorized it, but for the vast
majority who are not kicking in the value of a cup of coffee, here is a
portion of what you are missing.

What I’m trying to do with the paywall content is settle into a routine
where twice a week there is a written post and on Sunday a podcast. That
way, people kicking in five bucks or more per month can feel like they
are getting their money’s worth. For now, the paywall stuff is lighter
stuff. At least once a week is a movie review or commentary about
popular culture. The Sunday show is all news stuff.
