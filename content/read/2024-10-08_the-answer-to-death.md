One of the first awakenings people have on the road out of the liberal
mental order is the realization that libertarianism is nonsense. It is
why you find so many former libertarians in the dissident space. Many of
them started to see conservatism as a pointless trap, so they went
searching for another answer and landed on libertarianism, only to
discover that it was just a ridiculous version of conservatism. This
sent them off on the journey that led them over the great divide.

While libertarianism has collapsed, conservatives continue to struggle
with why their cause has slowly been marginalized, despite billions in
funding. On the one hand, they have no answer for the post-liberalism
that has swept the ruling elites. They struggle to even understand that
there is a ruling elite divorced from the ballot box. On the other hand,
they cannot bring themselves to join the populist reaction to the
post-liberalism that is executing a revolution from the top.

Other than chanting about their principles, these people have had no
answer for why they oppose the populists. Part of the conservative
delusion is to assume that you are part of a temporarily out of work
alternative elite. Once radicalism has run its course and everyone has
returned to their senses, you will once against be a part of the
cultural if not the political elite. Therefore, joining with those icky
prols in the populist movement means abandoning the dream of
restoration.

From Burke to the present day, this has been the personalized conceit of
what passes for conservatism in the Anglosphere. On the one hand, the
conservative is compelled to oppose radicalism in the name of culture
and tradition. On the other hand, he must defend the system, even as it
absorbs the values and principles of radicalism, because he imagines
himself one day in the leadership of the system. The ratchet effect
exists because conservatism exists.

At the most basic level, politics in the West has been driven by the
internal political dynamic of the United States. That dynamic is a dance
between those who operate on the assumption that the ends justify the
means and opposed by those who argue that the means justifies the ends.
The reason this has been a lopsided struggle in favor of the former is
they have a wider range of action. To win, they just have to learn what
the opponent will not do and then do that.

A good illustration of this is the Biden administration’s war on the
court system in the person of Jack Smith. The courts knock down his
spurious legal arguments, but he keeps coming back with new versions of
the same arguments, always with the purpose of jailing enemies of the
regime. Thousands continue to sit in jail after the Supreme Court shot
down the legal claim against them, because as far as Jack Smith and his
lieutenants are concerned, any means necessary is justified.

It is the one thing reactionaries understood. The antidote to people
like Jack Smith is not obsessive rule following but a radicalism far
more violent and deliberate than that practiced by Smith. You do not dig
up the corpse of Cromwell and put his skull on display as a deterrent.
You do so in order to get comfortable with what must be done to the next
lunatic that slips thorough he defenses. In order to defend the law, one
must go outside the law to destroy those who live outside the law.

Another way of thinking about it is the classic Western, *The Man Who
Shot Liberty Valance*, starring John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Lee
Marvin. In the film, set on the frontier, Stewart represents law and the
order. Marvin is the frontier, the forces arrayed against the law. This
is the central conflict of the story, which is settled when Stewart
finally agrees to confront Marvin. Wayne, the man with a foot in both
camps kills Marvin, but lets people think it was Stewart.

This is why conservatism is about to be run out of town. Like Stewart in
the film, it has always refused to accept that the law is not the answer
to the radicalism that seeks to destroy the very idea of law. Anyone or
anything that rose up to face the radicals was met by the conservatives
as a greater threat than the radicals. Imagine Jimmy Stewart having John
Wayne arrested before the big fight. Conservatives imagine themselves as
the defense of order, when in reality they are its chief opponent.

All is not yet lost for conservatives. Billions in financial support
have allowed them to survive their audience leaving them. While the
older generation is happy to sit around playing make believe until the
sweet relief of death, the younger generation is looking around
wondering if conservatism is worth saving. You see it in this
interesting <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/the-death-of-conservatism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">essay</a> by someone calling himself
Henry George. It is of the same tone you saw with libertarians a decade
ago before they had their awakening.

All of those cultural sentiments captured in words by conservative
writers over the years will only live on if the people moved by them are
willing to fight. They can either be pleasing thoughts as you slip into
the darkness of death, or they can be an inspiration to be far more
ruthless and radical than the radicals who promise to condemn your
culture and people to the dustbin of history. Some young conservatives
seem to be creeping up to this realization.

In the end, the sentimentality that is conservatism is a luxury item. It
can be indulged in times when there are no great threats to law and
order. That law and order, however, must be ruthlessly enforced by those
who cannot and will not allow their virtues to be turned into vices by
the enemies of law and order. If conservatism is to survive it must
transition from a comforting death into an inspiration for a violent
revolt against radicalism and the societal death that leads from it.
