Imagine one of your friends tells you that the governor of your state
was caught on video robbing a liquor store. Not only that, his brother
pistol-whipped the clerk during the commission of the crime. Most
likely, you would want proof. Your friend then sends you a link to a
Twitter thread on the subject. Knowing the volume of nonsense on
Twitter, you then go to mainstream news sites looking for something on
this incredible story, but everywhere you look you find nothing but
silence.

This would present a dilemma. On the one hand, you trust your friend and
the story does seem legitimate. Upon further inquiry you find some
stories tucked away here and there that confirm the tweet. Independent
news sites are howling about the crime and the refusal of the mainstream
media to notice it. The dilemma is not about believing the story is true
but about trusting your own judgement. If all of the serious people are
ignoring this story, why should you be outraged by it?

If this sounds familiar, it should. This is daily life in America.
Events that should warrant national coverage go unmentioned, while
trivial nonsense gets wall-to-wall coverage from all of the regime media
organs. Compounding it is the fact that the stuff getting covered comes
with truckloads of official lies and narratives designed to trick the
audience into viewing the facts presented in a way that leads to an
inaccurate understanding of the event in question.

We are in one of those moments today. Hunter Biden, the crackhead son of
Joe Biden, is due in court to plead guilty to some minor crimes. Not
happy with a sweetheart deal that is an affront to the idea of the rule
of law, one of his lawyers called the court yesterday, pretending to be
a lawyer for the Republicans, who had filed a brief with the court
contesting the sweetheart deal. This fake lawyer successfully convinced
the court clerk to withdraw the Republican filing.

This is not a small thing. The massive corruption involved in this plea
deal should warrant Watergate level coverage. Instead, regime media and
the volunteer army of online toadies pretend it is normal. Putting that
aside, no one would know about this outlandish effort to mislead the
court if not for
<a href="https://twitter.com/mirandadevine/status/1683990095949451264"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> on Twitter. The Drudge Report
has no mention of it. Memorandum, the news aggregator popular with media
content creators, has no mention of this event.

In fairness, there is a CNN <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/politics/hunter-biden-house-republicans-amicus-brief/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on it, but you have to dig
around to find it. The three primary media organs of the regime are
silent. There is no mention of it in the New York Times, the Washington
Post, or the Wall Street Journal. Putting aside the Nigerian levels of
corruption in this case, the absurdity of this stunt warrants attention.
Calling a court clerk the day before an appearance and pretending to be
a lawyer for another party in order to trick the court is Hollywood
comedy stuff.

As an aside, think about the sort of people who look at an event like
this and conclude it is not worth mentioning. It is a good reminder that
partisanship is not primarily about rooting for your side, but a hatred
of the enemy. The regime’s media organs actively participate in these
coverups because they hate the people they imagine are on the other side
of the hive walls. They are not covering for the Bidens because they
love these people, but because they hate you.

Putting that aside, what compounds the media silence on this story is
the outrageousness of it. The law firm involved is not a fly-by-night
operation that represents drug cases. Jessica Bagels, the lawyer who
pulled the caper, is Director of Litigation Services at Latham- Watkins.
This is what they used to call a “white shoe” law firm that represents
power players in politics and finance. These are the sorts of people
Hollywood uses in conspiracy thrillers like *The Firm*.

Of course, this casual acceptance of corruption speaks to the general
rot that has become the defining feature of the ruling class. It is not
that these people are breaking the rules for personal gain. It is that
they no longer have any respect for the spirit of the law that is
supposed to animate our society. These lawyers think nothing of tricking
a court clerk because they have no respect for her or the system. In
fact, these lawyers hold the legal system in contempt.

The only reason anyone knows about this latest Hunter Biden caper is
that there are still people in America who respect the spirit of the
law. They are outraged enough about this case to follow it and post what
they learn online. There are still millions of Americans who feel the
same sense of outrage, so they follow these people on places like
Twitter. Despite the best efforts by regime media, this information
still makes it into circulation and people are rightly angry about it.

This returns us to that dilemma at the start. The choice between
trusting yourself or the weight of official media rests on a more
important conflict. The people who think it proper to trick the court
operate from the belief that any means necessary is acceptable in order
to achieve their goals. The ends justify the means. The other side of
the dilemma are the people who reject this. They think the means justify
the ends and that we must always respect the process.

Therein lies the problem. The process no longer has the means to control
these corrupt forces in the system. The only solution is to abandon the
rules and use whatever means are required in order to remove the rot
from the system. What this example shows is that the people who think
the end justifies the means will always defeat the means justify the end
unless the latter makes an exception and embraces the ethos of the
former in order to restore order. That is the great dilemma of this age.
