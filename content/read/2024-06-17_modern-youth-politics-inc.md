travel and a series of daily travelogues about my time in Motown for
AFPAC, which was much more interesting than I expected. Subscribe

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbolism is one of the aspects of all politics, regardless of political
system, which tends to get missed by political people. This is
especially true of those we call the right, who are often deep in the
weeds of ideology or theory. They are like experts on paint who are more
concerned with the type of paint used by the great artist than the
actual painting he created and its larger meaning. You see this with the
reaction to the Nick Fuentes movement that just had its big party this
past weekend.

Since he started to gain a following, critics have struggled to find a
good way to attack him, as they often get tangled up in the symbolism.
He became a national figure during the 2016 MAGA movement, but shot to
the top with the 2020 election, where he toured the country holding
rallies in the “stop the steal” days. He would gather up young fans and
give speeches via bullhorn outside of state capitols. It was reminiscent
of the radical protests of the 1960’s and 1970’s.

That was the point, more than the actual content of the protests. It is
a form of guerilla marketing in which the counter to the well-financed
and carefully choregraphed messaging from the regime is the apparently
organic rejection of that message and the people behind the messaging.
In other words, the point was not what they were saying at these events.
The whole point of the event was to tell the world they exist, despite
the mass propaganda from the regime.

This has always had another function for Fuentes. It tells the
disaffected youth that there is a place they can go to be with other
likeminded people. They see these things happening on their preferred
platforms. They get talked up in the online spaces these young people
frequent and most importantly, they get criticized by the sorts of
people who make good foils for Fuentes. Like all good political animals,
Fuentes tends to attract the sorts of critics he needs to make his
points.

It is important to note that it has been a long time since someone has
come along with the skill of Fuentes in terms of generating excitement.
There is an electricity around his events that you never see at other
political events. He understands his audience because in reality,
Fuentes is his audience. He is trying to create the sort of excitement
he and they learned about in history class. He is building a youth
movement that mirrors what he thinks it was like in the Reagan or
Kennedy years.

This is why the marketing of Nick Fuentes and American First looks like
it is put together by profession marketing people. He and his entourage
arrive at their impromptu rallies wearing the American First gear, which
you can buy at the AF store and the crowd always has the same look at
feel. He is always surrounded by guys holding up their mobile device who
are surrounded by young men in blue blazers chanting the familiar chants
that have become a defining feature of this thing.

While it looks like great marketing, it is genuinely organic. Much has
been said about the fact that this generation is the first to be
socialized online, but they are also the first generation to be
saturated in and socialized by marketing. To old people, the thoroughly
commercialized culture of today feels alien and weird. To the young
people raised in it, it feels normal. It is simply a habit of mind. The
people you see at a Fuentes rally are just falling into the role that
fits them best.

In a way, it is as if life has become a video game. They play the
character that they feel comfortable playing. Instead of being the
barbarian character in the online game, they are the guy holding the
cell phone up next to Nick. The archers fall into the role of standing
in the back yelling the familiar slogans at Nick. Of course, there are
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeroy_Jenkins" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Leroy Jenkins</a> characters at these things. That would
be the black guy dressed as
<a href="https://x.com/Wild_West_Art/status/1802129166395171172"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Playa Maga</a> or the has-been grifters
like <a href="https://x.com/nwarikoo/status/1802316468979138582"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Duke</a>.

This is what trips up his “right-wing” critics. They see the assorted
kooks and weirdos that turn up at these events and then fashion an
argument against Fuentes and his followers that often reduces to petty
jealousy. Fuentes is doing what many of them said was impossible, mostly
because they lacked the skill and courage to try and do the things that
Fuentes is doing in terms of public demonstration. Calling Fuentes a
grifter is a way to feel good about losing.

When you talk to the people at a Fuentes event, and in Detroit they were
everywhere Saturday evening, they will tell you that people like Sneako
are not really part of the movement but something like the court jester.
They lack the sophistication to explain it, but they sense that the
point of these colorful characters is to decorate the public face of the
movement as something like an inside joke. The critics do not get it,
which is why they are not in it.

Therein lies the genuine problem for this thing. It is like everything
else in the modern mass media age in that it is just a thing you do
until the next thing comes along. It is why Fuentes has had to keep
shifting the focus and changing the characters in what is more like a
long running reality television show than a political movement. Every
season you get a new character and some new issues. It is not that it is
a grift or he is not serious, but rather this is what this generation
thinks is serious.

Another way to think of it is the films from twenty years ago where the
walls between virtual reality and reality break down and you have a
character from the digital world enter the real world or vice versa.
This is what is happening for a generation raised on mass media, mass
marketing within the context of virtual reality where the worst thing
that can happen to you is your character dies. The politics of this
generation are the politics of the internet, not the meat space.

Politics as professional wrestling is fun for the twenty-somethings who
are naturally drawn to it, but in time they will have to have real
lives. You see this transition in some of the older young people who are
now working and on their own. Standing outside a Nick rally yelling
those slogans feels foolish to them. That is the most likely way this
thing unfolds over the next few years. The youthful excitement and
superficiality will give way to more mature and serious politics.

This raises the question of the expiry date for Nick Fuentes. All pop
stars who court the youth audience run into the same problem. There
comes a point where their act goes from opportunistic to weird. They get
too old for their market. Fuentes looks like he is a teenager, so he has
time, but at some point, he will have to follow his older audience into
a more mature form of politics. The question that remains unasked and
unanswered is whether he will lead them or follow them.
