Way back when the Covid panic began, smart people pointed out that
shutting down an economy was going to have unforeseen consequences. A
modern economy is an incomprehensibly complex organism. Even turning off
some parts of it for a short time will change the organism, resulting in
downstream changes. It is why people who work with complex things are
very careful about the changes they make. They accept that there is much
about the system that they cannot known in advance.

Of course, the people in charge are sure they have it all figured out,
so they just blundered ahead with their lock downs and new rules.
Shutting down most of the restaurant industry and closing the schools.
for example, radically altered the demand side of the food market.
Suddenly, goods for the restaurant business had no demand, while demand
for home products shot through the roof. This should have given them
pause, but they kept blundering ahead with their schemes.

Anyone who has been in a grocery store of late knows that food prices
are jumping like it is the 1970’s again. There are also weird shortages.
Something like mayonnaise will disappear from the shelves for a week and
then come back, but then plastic bags become scarce. The same phenomenon
is happening with other things like building supplies and petroleum
products. The official statistics are complete nonsense, so we have no
idea how much food has jumped. It is enough that people are talking
about inflation in private conversations for the first time in decades.

The usual suspects, of course, are spilling into the streets to chant
about fiat currency, hyperinflation, and the rest of their stuff. It is
as if the Great Pumpkin has finally risen out of the pumpkin patch. They
have been waiting their whole lives for the Weimar moment foretold in
the prophesies. Because these people are always wrong it is good to
remember they are wrong now. The problem now is actually much worse than
too much money chasing too few goods. It is systemic.

For starters, governments around the world have been taking
sledgehammers to the global supply chain. These supply chains evolved
over a long period of time to solve the problems of getting goods to the
market. In response to Covid, government willy-nilly started turning
things on and off without much thought. The system can respond to short
term emergencies like natural disasters, but it was never equipped to
respond to random outages imposed by people who have never had a job.

Then you have the stimulus plans. Having idled large swaths of the
economy for periods, the same people frantically turning things on and
off started pumping money into the retail side. At first this new money
was absorbed in the system. Personal debt fell in 2020 as people got
conservative in the face of the crisis. They also began to change their
lives in response to the lockdowns. Going to the movies and out to eat
is a habit, not a necessity. Lots of habits changed in 2020.

Labor markets have been radically changed by Covid and the efforts from
the rulers to make a big show of dealing with it. Entry level jobs are
now hard to fill, because unemployment still pays very well. If you are
a restaurant opening for the first time in a year, finding help is
difficult. It is not a shortage of labor as much as a shortage of people
ready to go back to work. Labor shortages, however, they are created,
result in a spike in labor costs, which appear at the cash register.

Finally, we have monetary policy. Central bank policy has evolved over
the last thirty years based on certain assumptions. Government policy,
for example, has been predictable going back to the 1990’s. While there
have been the usual problems, the global economy has settled into some
predictable patterns. All of a sudden, none of this is true, so monetary
policy has to adjust. Adjusting to erratic government behavior and
unpredictable consequences in the economy is practically impossible.

The upshot to all of this is we are seeing real inflation for the first
time in generations, but we have a variety of causes this time. In the
1970’s, it was too much money chasing too few goods. Pulling money out
of the economy was painful, but it worked. This time, we have too much
money in some areas, but we have broken supply chains and labor markets
contributing to the problem. The Fed cannot do anything about shortages
of aluminum cans or chicken farm with too few chickens.

To make matters worse, pulling money out of the system is probably not
possible, given decades of ultra-low borrowing rates. The world has
become so accustomed to low interest rates, it has become an axiom, like
the changing of the seasons or the laws of thermodynamics. Any
significant change in the money supply to combat retail inflation would
send the financial markets into a tailspin. Housing would collapse if
mortgage rates returned to anything resembling normal.

None of this means there is no answer. Often, the right answer is to do
nothing and let things run their course. That was the right answer with
Covid. As with Covid, the rulers cannot accept that answer, so they will
thrash around some more. The people animating the corpse of Joe Biden
are promising to smash things up some more for the greater good. After
all, what matters to them is that we know the people in the mansions and
castles really care about us, while they live like royalty.

The result of all this is we are heading into a cruel summer. The bill
for the Covid response is coming due. How a society responds to crisis
is the result of the social trust in that society. America is a low
trust society now. Further, the people who will be counted on to dig out
of the mess created by the rulers are now treated like second class
citizens by those rulers. The fix to the 60’s and 70’s was to first
repair the loss of faith in the system. It is hard to imagine that
happening this time.
