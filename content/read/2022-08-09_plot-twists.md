The French and Russian revolutions are probably the two most important
events in contemporary Western history. They have been studied from
every angle, but they continue to be studied by scholars. One reason for
the enduring interest is these events still cast a shadow over the
present. The constructs that arose from the French Revolution are still
with us. The great divide between East and West as a result of the
Bolshevik Revolution still haunts the world.

Another reason for keeping these two great revolutions in the front of
the mind is they are examples of how a ruling elite can bring about its
own demise. The violent end of the regime was made inevitable by regime
actions. The French king could have plotted a different course, but he
made every mistake available to him. The Tsar was in a much more
difficult position, but he had plenty of warnings about what was coming
and he could have prepared accordingly.

These two revolutions are as much about ruling elite error as the social
and political movements we associate with them. If the French king had
been a bit more prudent it is possible the revolution would not have
happened at all. If there were betting odds on such things, regicide
would have been the longest of long shots on the board prior to the
start of unrest. Most of the people pushing for change prior to Lenin
seizing power were hoping the Tsar would help with the process.

The compelling feature of these events is that the major players seemed
blind to that which should have been obvious. The forces of change and
the defenders of the status quo operated like two black boxes. Neither
side could see inside the other, so they were left to guess about the
motivations behind the observed actions. Inevitably, they assigned the
worst motives to the other side. Killing the sovereign, thereby killing
the system he represented, was easy when he was seen as evil.

We seem to be seeing the same dynamic form up in present day America as
the ruling class operates by motives that baffle those outside. The raid
on former president Trump by the FBI is the latest event without an
obvious explanation. A feature proudly celebrated by the American
political class for a long time is that Americans do not criminalize
politics like other countries. The losers of elections are not jailed
and former officer holders are not persecuted.

For two years the political class has been waging a war against the
former president and his supporters for reasons that continue to baffle.
There must be a reason as there is a reason for everything, but no
logical reasons make sense. Again, we look at our political class and
see a black box at the center of their actions. It is what motivates
them but what is going on inside is a mystery. As a result, we are left
to speculate as to their motivations and that always leads to dark
motives.

Like the ruling elites in the two great revolutions, this ruling elite
seems to be obsessed with finding the worst option. The right answer in
the aftermath of the 2020 election was for Washington to be reminded of
Jefferson’s <a
href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-12-02-0348"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">timeless question</a>. “And what country
can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to
time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?” The right
response was “to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them.”

Instead, we have pogroms. This raid on Trump’s home not only raises
questions about the motives of the administration, but it colors the
January 6 events. An organized war by the deep state against reformers
is a narrative that explains both the persecution of the protestors and
the attacks on the former president. Even for those highly skeptical of
the “deep state” narrative will start to come around. It also helps
explain side events like the attacks on Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes.

In those prior revolutions, a logic took over that naturally led to the
conclusion that the system was the problem. It was not just the polices
that emanated from the system, but the system itself that was the
problem. In Russia and France, the man at the top was the
personification of the system. A point was reached where anything the
king said or did was viewed through this logic. The trust between the
people and their sovereign was irrevocably broken and the end became
inevitable.

One strange difference between the current age and those revolutionary
ages is the roles are reversed. In 18th century France, it was the
people at the top defending the old order and the people challenging it.
The same was true in Russia. In America, the people at the top see
themselves as the revolutionaries and the people view themselves as the
defenders of the old order. A big part of this crisis is the ruling
class mocking the history and tradition of the people.

What makes it even more bizarre is that if the ruling class is
successful in discrediting the old system, the people will no longer
have restraint. It is the lingering trust in the system, the desire to
vote harder, that prevents January 6th from spreading to every state
capital in the country. These efforts by the ruling class to burn it all
down can only lead to one end for them. The FBI raiding Trump’s house
convinced a lot of people that the system is now too far gone to save
with an election.

It is a good example of how history can be a guide, but the parallels
are never perfect, so we are left to feel our way through things. Lenin
knew his history, which is why he quickly had the Tsar and his family
murdered. He knew where his revolution should end so he moved quickly to
the closing scenes. On the other hand, despite their study of history,
none of the Bolsheviks saw Stalin and his terror coming. Even when you
know the script, it is sometimes hard to accept the plot.

Perhaps that is what is happening in the black box at the center of the
Cloud People society that seems to control their actions. Perhaps inside
it they are feverishly hoping to write a new ending to an old story.
Their actions, however, are the main plot device of that old story. The
harder they work to create a new narrative, the more their actions seem
to confirm the oldest of narratives. The great plot twist they think
they are fashioning is that there is no plot twist to their story.
