Greg Johnson and Mark Collett had a <a
href="https://odysee.com/@joeldavis:0/Mark-Collett-vs.-Greg-Johnson---the-Ukraine-debate:1?r=3z9tryPnWbnHCsX7miaF2gHZsdDgpVfN"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">debate</a> about the war in Ukraine, with
each man taking a quite different view of the war. It was a reasonable
and polite exchange, so if you like these things, it is worth a listen.
I must admit I struggle to follow the logic of Greg’s argument, as it
leads him to defend the people who would throw him in a cage if they had
the chance, but perhaps the fault lies with me.

Regardless, the debate itself is a good jumping off point to talk about
other issues related to the larger struggle. Like Covid, the war in
Ukraine is a bit of a litmus test on this side of the great divide.
Where you stand on the issue says a lot about where you stand on many
other issues. Like Covid, it is becoming one of those reference points
for other differences in the dissident sphere.

That said, much of the debate about the war, and you see in the Collett
– Johnson debate, is trapped in the 20th century. In fact, the war
exists because the Global American Empire is a product of the 20th
century and the beneficiaries of the empire cannot let go of the past.
As a result, people often find themselves trying to jam the present into
those old models of politics.

The fact is, the 20th century is over and it is long past time for the
West to close the books on it. Further, the liberal era is over. We live
in post-liberal societies and it is time to face up to that reality.
More important, the political modes of thought from the past no longer
apply to this age because we no longer have the same human capital as
those past modes of thought require. We need to think different.
