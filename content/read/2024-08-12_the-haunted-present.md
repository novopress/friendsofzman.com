------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the dawn of the information age, it was assumed that everyone having
the sum of human knowledge at their fingertips would unleash human
potential in ways that had never been imagined. Instead of vast swaths
of information being cloistered in the books of specialists, it would be
available to everyone. The democratization of information would not only
raise all of humanity but unleash the potential of people who would
otherwise be denied access to the information.

A couple generations into it and this has clearly not been the case.
Creative output, for example, has grounded to a halt. New movies and
television shows are, at best, technically superior, but creatively
inferior, remakes of past works. The traditional arts, like painting and
sculpture, have been made ridiculous in an attempt to find novelty
rather than genuine cultural expression. The creative side of Western
culture has reached a nadir as technology has reached its zenith.

The public space, of course, has become so narrow that comparisons to
the Soviet era are becoming trite. In the UK, men are being sent to
dungeons for the crime of mentioning that foreigners are murdering
British school children. In the United States, the secret police is
everywhere looking for dissidents to harass. The great democratization
of information and the public square has led to a dark age of
authoritarian violence and suppression.

Alexander Duggan once said that the end of the Cold War was a
catastrophe for the world, by which everyone assumed he meant the
Russian world. That was certainly true, as the Russian world had evolved
to depend on the Cold War as both a justification for the Soviet system
but also the framework in which people lived. Once the Cold War ended,
the moral framework collapsed along with the political system, and the
result was a generation of chaos.

Something similar may be happening with the flood of data that has
washed over the Western world via the internet. We now live in a world
where it is plain to see that every creative thing one can imagine has
been done and most likely done better than anything that could be done
today. Why paint portraits when the greatest portrait painters who ever
lived, have already lived? Why sculpt when a machine with unlimited
information can produce better results?

No one thinks too much about how the technological revolution must
change the way we organize ourselves, because we are awash in the
history of the twentieth century where all of the political ideologies
were resolved, and liberal democracy was declared the winner. The end of
history has left us with nothing but history. The information age has
not just made the past accessible, but it has also tuned the past into a
great flood that washes over every aspect of the modern age.

The curse of information is most evident in the public square where it
is easy to see, or at least it seems that way, that every idea worth
discussing has been raised, debated, and judged in the past? More
important, every idea that is viewed as dangerous can be compared to
something from that past that has been condemned. The reason that
everyone with questions is called Hitler and even the slightest push
back is fascism is that the information age makes such comparison
simple.

Why would a young political activist spend time thinking critically
about the world as it is when he can more easily look up ideas from the
past and then repackage them for the present age? The reason our
politics feels like a technically superior reboot of prior politics is
that all of the participants are rooting around in the past for
inspiration, rather than thinking of something new. Instead of standing
on the shoulders of the past, everyone now trembles in its shadow.

The promise of the internet was that it would unlock the doors to the
future, but instead it has walled them off by opening every door to the
past. It is simply too easy to find what you need from the stock of
existing knowledge than to take a step back and think about what you are
seeing. The information age has turned the intellectual space into an
endless museum in which we are all trapped, forced into playing roles
from the past, regardless of their applicability to the present.

This may explain the woke business. The reason people are creating these
bizarre and logically impossible roles for themselves, things like
transgenderism, for example, is as a way to escape the conformity of the
present. On the one hand we live in a world where you are told to be an
authentic individual, but the information age shows that every human
character has already existed. The solution is to break free from reason
itself in order to create new roles to play.

Another piece of this is the American civic religion of progressivism,
which treats the past like an angry mob chasing after the righteous. The
information age has turned the past into a deadly fog that has descended
onto society. The only solution to this is to destroy reality itself
since the past is what shapes present reality. The war on biology,
reason, truth, and empiricism is a war on the fabric of reality that
defines the present and that which makes the past possible, our minds.

In the final analysis, the information age, especially the internet, may
turn out to be a terrible curse, rather than a liberating force. For
most of human history, the past was of little use, other than the
lessons of the past. These were contained in stories and songs, rather
than in detailed accounts of the events and participants. The point of
the past, in this context, was to inspire, rather than constrain. Our
detailed knowledge of the past, in contrast, is a psychological prison.

Ironically, this is not new either. James Joyce wrote about how the
Irish were prisoners of their own struggle. The fictional South created
by William Faulkner was also haunted by the past. The solution in both
cases was the abnegation of that present reality in order to close the
door to what created it. The Ireland of Joyce no longer exists, and the
South of Faulkner exists only as a bogeyman for the progressive. The
solution to the past haunting the present was to abandon it entirely.
