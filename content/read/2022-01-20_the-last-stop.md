Way back in the 1980’s, it was popular for members of the conservative
movement to claim that the Left had run out of ideas. It was true to the
extent that the Left had run out of policy ideas, having used them up in
the preceding four decades. Conservatives were brimming with ideas on
how to fix those policies. The big talk of rolling them back was really
just a politically astute way of making reform look radical. The Right
was always about fixing what the Left had broken.

The truth is though, those old progressive ideas from the early part of
the century had run their course, but a new set of ideas were
percolating in the academy. What we think of today as cultural Marxism
and “wokeness” was coming together in the flophouses and brothels of
left-wing politics. After the Cold War ended, these ideas started to
take over the Left until we reached the present crisis. This crisis,
however, seems to be the end of the line for radical thinking.

You see it with the obsession with Trump. Stable minded people with an
agenda, even a nutty agenda, would have erased their old foe from the
history books after dispatching him in the 2020 election. Instead, they
cannot stop thinking about him and the army of imaginary bogeymen they
think he leads. The Democrats have now hatched a <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/589858-democrats-see-good-chance-of-garland-prosecuting-trump"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">plot</a> to charge him with sedition so
he cannot run for office in 2024. In reality, it is just a way to keep
him alive as an adversary.

To normal people, this looks like madness. The truth is, Trump is old
news and by the time 2024 rolls around he will probably not be a lock to
win the nomination. This Ann Coulter
[column](https://www.takimag.com/article/the-message-in-the-polls-trumps-done/)
is a good indication that many of the people who supported Trump in 2016
are ready for someone new. Coulter’s judgement on these things is not
always the best, she was a fan of Mitt Romney, but she speaks for
Populist Inc. They are ready to move on and the Democrats would be wise
to let them.

That said, Trump is a master marketer and he could very well retool his
act as a revenge tour in 2024. Given the state of things right now and
the chaos that looms on the horizon, the public could be ready to burn
it all down. The GOP will surely win both house this fall then set about
finking on their voters. The next presidential election could be a
battle to win over factions in a purple-faced rage at the politicians.
In that environment, Trump could look like the sober choice.

Still, the Left won the revolution and should be busy enjoying the
fruits of victory but instead they long to return to the battle. The
reason is the ideology that fueled the revolution is turning out to be
nothing but clever words with no truth content. There is no end of
history, no promised land of equality. Rather than being a strength,
diversity has turned out to be a clever marketing scheme by corporate
communists who live like white nationalist while lecturing everyone
about race.

What the Left has quickly become is a glaring example of negative
identity. They are not for anything that exists. Instead, they are a
laundry list of things they oppose, with the claim that these things
stand in the way of paradise. The fact that many of the things they rage
against do not, in fact, exist, makes the agony all the more severe. It
turns out that bellowing about white supremacy, something that does not
exist, is not as fulfilling as screaming in the face of someone wearing
a red hat.

In the movie *Conspiracy* about the 1942 [Wannsee
Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference), one of
the actors tells another a story about a man who hated his father and
loved his mother. When his mother died, he did not weep at her grave.
When his father died, he was inconsolable, crying like a baby. The
lesson of the story was that the man had defined his life by his hatred
of his father. When his father was gone, he lost that which gave meaning
and purpose to his life. That was why he was crying.

The American Left and their political party are now that man weeping at
the grave of Donald Trump’s presidential career. This is, in part, why
they cannot let go of the Covid madness, despite their party’s efforts.
The mask is a reminder of better times when they had a reason to get up
every morning. It is why their party is putting on the insurrection show
for them. It is a bit of nostalgia for better times. It is why they hope
to reanimate the Trump movement with an indictment.

That is the trouble with negative identity. A political movement
organized around it can only end in sorrow. If it wins, it loses the
reason to exist. If it fails, it runs the risk of retribution from the
people it assaulted and it runs the risk of internal dissention over not
having defeated the enemy. Negative identity becomes a self-made Alamo,
a desperate last stand by people afraid of the future. It is why these
movements attract so many weirdos and degenerates.

Unlike in the 1980’s, the sputtering of the prevailing radicalism is
unlikely to give way to a new radicalism, at least not from the Left.
Cultural Marxism was a reaction to the failing of economic Marxism.
There is no next step in the underlying theory of history that animated
both ideologies. This really is the end of the road for the theoretical
framework that gave birth to Utopian radicalism. What comes next will
probably be outside the old model of Left and Right.
