It has been an interesting week for yours truly. Starting off with the
trip into the Imperial Capital then the fallout from my reporting on it.
Lots of new eyes on the site as a result, which is always welcome, but
not all eyes are good eyes. I’ve gotten a lot of interesting e-mail from
these new readers. Then there were the links to social media posts about
the VDare piece on the conference. This is one of those weeks where I
was glad I was not on Twitter. That’s not a distraction I need in my
life.

The funny thing to me about this week is I went into it thinking no one
but me and a few others, maybe, would care about this thing. I was not
all that excited about it, because I thought it was going to be three
days with people trapped in the past. There was certainly some of that,
but there were also a lot of people now on the river’s edge, looking
across to our side of the great divide. That was quite an eye-opener for
me and the big white pill of the week. It’s not always bad news.

That said, I am looking forward to things returning to normal. I have a
million unfinished projects right now, which brings me stress, Getting
back to the normal routine means slowly knocking things off the list. My
dream, for decades now, is to wake up one day, look at the to-do list
and see everything crossed off. Of course, that will mean I am dead and
finally ascended to the next plane of existence, so maybe I should be
happy that the list of open items is longer than it seems I will ever
finish.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
