The days are getting short, and the year is getting short, so it is a
good time to clear out the backlog of ideas on the idea list. I keep a
running list of possible show topics that tends to get out of hand over
time. This time of the year is when I try to impose some order on things
and get ready for the next year. This week is actually a few show ideas
combined into one two-hour show.

Another motivation was to address the whole “what do we do about normie”
topic from a couple of different angles. This is a popular topic on this
side of the great divide, especially around an election. It seems that
some people cannot accept the reality of their condition, no matter how
many times they get bonked on the head. How can you reach someone who
seems to be immune from observable reality?

The problem with the “what do we do about normie” problem is people
start with democratic assumptions. That is, the point of politics is to
get fifty percent plus one of the people to agree. That does not make a
lot of sense for a political movement that rejects the claims of
democracy. Dissident politics is never going to be about winning over
the majority of the public. It is about ending that nightmare.

Of course, dealing with the sorts of people who still read National
Review or listen to Ben Shapiro is frustrating. Every normal man is
tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin
strangling civic nationalists. One reason for addressing these people is
to learn how to do it without becoming homicidal. A good salesman knows
the difference between a prospect and a contact.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

**Promotions:** The good folks at

readers of this site. You just click on the

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
