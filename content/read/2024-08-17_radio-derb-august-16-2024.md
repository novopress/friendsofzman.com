For those wondering about the transcript, it is located on Derb’s <a
href="https://www.johnderbyshire.com/Miscellaneous/Radio/VWokvFz3/transcript.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">site</a>. I could probably post it here,
but I will have to check with Derb. He may want to have people come to
his site for the written version. There are free transcription services
I could use to put the transcript in the Rumble and Odysee version. I
have not used them, but it might be a fun thing to play around with at
some point.

Some have asked if this is the start of hosting the work of others and
the answer to that is maybe, possibly, we shall see. The new version of
this site that creeps toward reality will have the ability to create
spaces for others to post their work. A dissident collective like the
Daily Kos model could be a good idea or could be a terrible idea, so I
am thinking it through very slowly.
