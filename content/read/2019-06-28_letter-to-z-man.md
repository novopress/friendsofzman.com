Catching up on some correspondence this week. I think these types of
shows are going to be a regular feature going forward. They are fun to
do, as I get to talk about some topics I would probably not address
otherwise. I’ve also gotten a good response, so people seem to like the
format. The Ask Me Anything events Reddit does always get big numbers,
so the concept must have broad appeal. I know I enjoy reading through
those things whenever it is someone I follow or find interesting.

It’s also a good way for me to clean up the inbox. I read everything,
but responding in a timely fashion has been a problem. I’m a busy guy
these days. Then there is the P. O. Box, which gets a fair number of
letters. I’ve learned something on that score. Reading an actual letter
is much more enjoyable than reading e-mail. There is something to the
tactile experience of opening the letter and reading from paper. It’s
like the difference between reading an eBook and reading an actual book.

I also suspect the medium changes how the person doing the writing
experiences the exchange as well. Dashing off a quick e-mail and hitting
send is almost a mindless exercise most of the time. Typing up a letter,
or especially writing one by hand, takes thought and care. It’s slower
and more deliberative. It reminds me of when I’ve written formal letters
in my business life. I write it out by hand, then type it up and have
someone read it. Only when it is right does it get sent.

Reading through a stack of letters, I can’t help but think we would be
better off going back to that mode of communication in our personal
lives. Today, the physical mail is for impersonal stuff like letters
from the government. Our dealings with our corporate overlords are
another reason for physical mail. With our friends and family, we rely
on texts or social media posting. It seems like we have this backward.
The corporate overlord should be hitting us up on-line and our family
should get the letters.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
