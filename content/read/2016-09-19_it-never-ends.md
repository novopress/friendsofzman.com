target="_blank">The Interwebs brings news</a> that Hillary Clinton’s
“eraser” may have been on Reddit asking for advise about altering
classified documents.

> A collaborative investigation showed a reddit user with the username
> stonetear requested help in relation to retaining and purging email

> The requests match neatly with publicly known dates related to

What’s astonishing to me is the fact Team Cankles hired the dumbest IT
people they could find. How can you have a job in IT and not know that
anything posted on the Internet is forever. There is no deleting stuff.
Similarly, they appear to have not fully understood how e-mail works.

> Hello all- I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need
> to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived
> email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST
> file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to
> anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email
> address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send
> out.  
> I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell, or
> exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a
> batch processing program of some sort.  
> Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or
> suggestions on how this might be accomplished?

There’s nothing wrong with going on-line for help, but if I’m hiring
someone to be my super secret e-mail eraser, I want someone that
*answers* these questions, not the guy that *asks* them.

There’s little doubt at this point that members of Team Clinton should
have been charged with obstruction of justice, in addition to violation
of federal law with regards to classified information. If we had
anything resembling the rule of law, most of Team Clinton would be in
Federal prison working on deals where they roll on the old bag. Instead,
there’s a very real chance she ends up in the White House.
