target="_blank">In a speech delivered Wednesday</a>, that was supposed
to be the pièce de résistance for one of the dumbest men to take up
space in the political class, John Forbes Kerry declared himself an
anti-Semite. He was not that polite about either. If he had simply said,
“I hate Jews” that would be better than what he actually said.
Specifically he said, “Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, but it
cannot be both.” In other words, he hates the very concept of Judaism,
not just a particular manifestation of it.

The implication, the only way to interpret it, is that he thinks Judaism
is incompatible with liberal democracy. There’s never been a time when
he has hinted at the same argument with regards to Islam. He has not
even said this about Christianity. That would be laughably stupid, but
Lurch is a laughably stupid man. No, he specifically singled out Judaism
for this argument. Judaism is incompatible with democracy. Presumably,
he would argue that Jews can either be Jewish or citizens of a
democracy, but not both.

Sensible people have pointed out for years that Islam is incompatible
with modern liberal democracy. The reason we say this is Muslims
regularly say that Islam is incompatible with Western liberalism.
Logically, Imams and Muslim scholars are good authorities on these
issues so taking them at their word is a good idea. The fact that
everywhere Muslims get to vote they go for theocracy confirms these
claims. Muslims are not fond of democracy and they really hate modern
liberal democracy.

Israel is a Jewish state and a liberal democracy. Christians and Muslims
are free to do their thing, as long as they abide by the laws of Israel,
which are written by the Israeli parliament. In theory, Israelis could
vote to fling open their borders and let the Muslims pour into the
country. They can vote for all sorts of things, because it is a
democracy, but they choose to be a Jewish state that preserves itself as
the homeland of world Jewry. As a sovereign people, that is their right
and consistent with western liberal democracy.

John Kerry disagrees. He does not thinks Jews have a place in a liberal
democracy, even one of their own. The modern Progressive sees national
and ethnic identity as obstacles to the glorious future. It’s why they
embrace open borders and multiculturalism. They truly believe that
obliterating ethnic and national identity is the key to the lock. Jews
are the most stubborn of ethnic groups because they combine race and
religion into a single, immutable identity. That simply cannot work in
the glorious future.

It was always just a matter of time before American progressives got
around to Jew-hating. Once you go down the road of multiculturalism, you
eventually end up trying to erase anything resembling cultural
identity. Now that you-know-who is far enough in the past, no longer in
the rear view mirror for most people, taking on the tree stump of ethnic
identity was inevitable. For 2,000 years, Jews have kept their thing
going in the West, despite every conceivable attempt to erase them. Now
it is the Left’s shot at them.
