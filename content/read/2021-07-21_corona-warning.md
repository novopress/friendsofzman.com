It is becoming increasingly clear that most of what the ruling class has
been telling us about the corona virus is false. The virus is real, and
people have died from it, but everything else we have been told has not
been 100% true. The origin of the virus is the most obvious example.
Trump called it the “China Virus”, so the managerial elite denied that
was the case. They made claims about it possibly originating somewhere
else and just showing up in force in China. That was a lie.

Of course, the big lie to this point is that the measures the government
imposed were rooted in science. Mask wearing was about preventing the
sick from spreading the virus to the rest of us. Alternatively, it was
about keeping healthy people from inhaling the virus as it buzzed around
in the air. The social distancing stuff was also supposed to be science!
None of the measures turned out to be rooted in anything more than
superstition and a desire to abuse the population.

The reason that most people went along with these measures initially was
that the official word about the virus was that it was Black Death. It
is easy to forget, but the regime circulated images of bodies in the
streets over in Wuhan. They used similar images when the virus hit
Italy. Then they used images from horror movies claiming they were from
overrun hospitals. They sold the virus as a potential extinction event,
so even the most cynical prepared for the worst.

Corona has become the very definition of the big lie. The warnings about
the virus were “lies so colossal that no one would believe that someone
could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.” One should
take a minute to appreciate the amazing bit of irony in all of this.
Hitler is credited with coining the term to describe the people he saw
as his natural enemy. Today, the people relying on the big lie to
sustain themselves are making themselves mad looking for Hitler.

Putting all of that aside, we may be arriving at a point where those
previous big lies start to shrink down in size and look reasonable. The
number of people testing positive for the corona virus, despite being
fully vaccinated, is becoming an issue. In the UK, they are reporting
that between 40% and 60% of patients hospitalized with corona have been
fully vaccinated. There is some confusion about the number as they
originally reported the higher figure, but then the media made them
change it.

We are seeing something similar happening in Israel. They have been one
of the most aggressive countries on the vaccination front. They started
early and were the most effective at getting people into the program. As
a result, they are one of the most vaccinated countries in the world.
They are currently reporting that over 60% of their severe cases are
people who have been fully vaccinated. Moderna executives may want to
hire food testers and people to start their cars.

In the United States, it is unlikely that these sorts of numbers will be
reported as the government and media are simply too dishonest. We do
have other ways of seeing if the pattern is the same here. Sports teams,
for example, are the most vaccinated populations and they are seeing
people come down with corona, despite having been fully vaccinated. They
are young and strong, so the cases are mild. Nancy Pelosi’s staff just
reported corona infections, despite being fully vaxxed.

Largely ignored by the media thus far is the fact that the vaccine
makers think booster shots in the fall may be required. It is hard to
know if this is just another lie to keep the money flowing or it is an
admission that the vaccine is not as advertised. It could also be a way
to sell another panic in the fall, when the normal flu returns. We have
reached the point where the only thing we can trust is that whatever we
are being told is a lie, but the motivation for the lie is a mystery.

There are a few things going on here. One is that the fanatical testing
that should never have been put into place is turning up many false
positives. This sort of testing is supposed to err on the side of the
false positive. It is not supposed to be used on the population as a
whole. It is supposed to be used when there is a serious medical
condition that requires treatment. A vaccinated ball player with a runny
nose should not be tested for the corona virus or anything else.

The bigger issue, however, is that the vaccines are not as claimed. Past
experience with vaccines for corona viruses has shown that these
approaches were not highly effective, and they were short lived. Even
natural immunity fades with time, but with these vaccines it seems to
fade quickly. That is fine if you want to create artificial herd
immunity to eliminate the virus from a herd of cattle, but it is not so
useful for human population in large diverse societies not fully
vaccinated.

What may be happening is the vaccines are highly effective in the short
term, but the immunity fades during the first year. This may be the
reason for the booster shot stuff that will arrive in the fall. It could
also be that the vaccine is narrowly effective for the initial variant,
but not for subsequent variants. Given the lack of testing before the
roll out, we can only guess. There is also the possibility that the
vaccine is a trillion dollar boondoggle that has very little utility at
all.

When public trust collapses, the truth no longer has meaning. What
carries the day is the most compelling narrative. This should have been
the lesson of Hitler, who came to power because he provided the most
compelling narrative. Repeated and unnecessary lying by the managerial
class regarding Covid means that the facts are quickly losing their
value. Instead, it will be the best narrative that carries the day. No
amount of censoring will prevent that from happening.

It is fairly clear that we are well past the public health concern with
Covid. The treatments for those with severe cases are now highly
effective. Most of the population has natural immunity. The variants
appear to be less severe than the first wave of the virus, which is not
uncommon in pandemics. In other words, we are at the point where we can
live with Covid, just as we live with the flu. The question now is
whether we can live with the people who have spent two years lying about
it.
