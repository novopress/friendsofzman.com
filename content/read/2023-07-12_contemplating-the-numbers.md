A genuinely novel feature of the modern age is numbers, as in statistics
about all sorts of things regarding daily life. Every day some new set
of numbers is announced and people who allegedly know about the subject
will comment upon them. The government is about to release a fresh batch
of inflation data and the volunteer army of economists will talk about
them for the next week. The modern age is a game of numbers about
everything including the numbers.

This was not always so. For most of human history people could only tell
if there was food inflation by noticing that food was more expensive.
The king did not send someone out to read the latest inflation figures.
The main reason is the king did not know those figures and had no reason
to know. That is the other thing about numbers. They only mean something
to us in context. The official inflation rate matters only when you
understand the concept behind those numbers.

Months after Bud Lite decided to associate their brand with child
molesters, people are still tracking the numbers associated with the
brand. They have lost X million in market value and X percent of market
share. Bud Lite is no longer the most popular cheap beer and has lost X
percent of sales year-over-year. To the people in the culture war, these
numbers have meaning. It says that lots of people agree with them on the
moral question at the center of those numbers.

Moral arithmetic is everywhere. Nick Fuentes went on a ghetto internet
program the other day and his fans cannot stop talking about the
numbers. They say that over one hundred thousand people got to see him
use the N-word in front of a group of black people who look like they
work at a strip club. What he said and did and where he did it is not
what matters. It is how many people saw it that matters. The underlying
logic is the bigger the number, the better the result.

The entertainment business is all about numbers. An artistically
grotesque film that sells millions of tickets is better than a great
film that only appeals to a niche audience or people with refined
tastes. The reason is we do not have a moral metric to use to rate the
artistic quality of films. We have ranking lists, but they often rely on
the numbers related to popularity. The first Star Wars movies got high
ratings from critics because they made a lot of money, despite being
mediocre content.

One reason popular politics looks like a carnival is that we can measure
popularity through polling and voting. If fifty percent plus one think
candidate X is best, then he is the best, even if he is a brain damaged
hobo. This is why political actors degrade themselves for attention. The
math of politics says that X percentage of people who notice you will
agree with you, so the goal is to always increase the number of people
who take notice of you. That is the math of the circus.

Roger Scruton once described conservatism as the understanding that
there are things too important to be subjected to the marketplace. This
is essentially a rejection of the math of democracy. Just because one
idea has a bigger number next to it than the other idea does not mean it
is true or qualitatively better. Having a brain damaged hobo in the
senate is not normatively better than having a Turkish carny in the
senate, no matter what the numbers tell us.

This is the problem with conservatism. Who decides that something is too
important to be subject to the numbers? There are only two choices.
Either a supernatural force like God decides or the people through time
and experience decide what is no longer subject to the numbers. The
former requires a strong religious foundation for society and the latter
is just democracy in slow motion. It turns out that Sir John Filmer was
right, and John Locke was wrong.

Of course, we value the numbers of life in this age because we trust
that the numbers are not just a reflection of some normative truth but
that they are accurate. Low inflation is a good thing so when the
government comes out with numbers that say it is at or near the target
of two percent, the experts cheer the rulers. This only makes sense if
you think the government numbers are correct. The math of this age rests
on people trusting the numbers of this age.

Is inflation really near three percent now? Did Joe Biden really get
more votes than any human in the history of elections? Do most Americans
back Ukraine? Was last Thursday the hottest day in the history of the
planet? Despite the lack of evidence to support most of the numbers,
most people seem to trust them. At the same time, most people do not
trust the people issuing the numbers. For most of human history people
would know to never trust anything from untrustworthy people.

That is the other novel thing about this age. Christianity has faded for
most people as a foundation for moral claims. Something has to fill the
void, so we have been flooded with new numbers to function as the
authority. This explains why people trust the numbers while distrusting
the people issuing the numbers. People are believing machines so when
they stop believing in God, they will find something else. In this age
people have come to trust the numbers as a last resort.

In a way though, this is the metric of the liberal society. It works
when people can trust the people in official positions. They can trust
those people because they trust the institutions to police the people in
the institutions. Even in times when the office holders are distrusted,
the people can still trust the numbers because they are viewed as the
product of the institutions. As long as people still trust the numbers,
the rulers are safe, despite the fact they do nothing but lie to us.
