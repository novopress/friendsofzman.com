This being Good Friday, I thought a show about Christianity and the
dissident right would be a good topic. I was torn on how I wanted to do
it, so it did not come out as well as I hoped. I had a few ideas on how
to approach the subject, but I could not settle on one, so I ended up
coming at it from a few different angles. In retrospect, I should have
mulled it over a bit longer to get my thoughts in order. On the other
hand, it means I can revisit the topic at some point in the future.

One of the odd things about dissident politics is that our side of the
great divide has different tribes that probably would not find common
cause if not for having been driven off the public stage. Thirty years
ago, the “secular right” was not all that fond of the religious right.
They even setup a [site](http://secularright.org/) for themselves as a
refuge from those Bible-wielding conservatives. It looks like they ran
out of steam a couple of years ago, which is fitting given the
circumstances of the moment.

It seems like there is an opportunity for the two main wings of the
dissident right to find common cause again. If you look at the main
players in the new free speech movement, for example, they tend to be
men of faith. The American First crowd is very proudly Christian, even
though they do not get into the details of what that means. On the other
hand, the authority of the secular wing is rooted in biological reality.
The quantifiable differences in people are the starting point for many
dissidents.

In the before times, the secular wing always chaffed at the rhetoric of
Christian conservatives, mostly out of ignorance. People drawn to
secular politics tend not to be comfortable with the topics in religion.
Today, Christians tend to be uncomfortable with the langue of most
dissidents. Talk of evolution is alienating to them, because they have
been conditioned to view it as an enemy of their faith. Our side of the
great divide is an uneasy alliance of people who do not entirely trust
one another.

That is the main point of the show this week. Secular people need to get
more comfortable talking about religion, but dissident Christians need
to reexamine their hostility to certain dissident topics. The fact is a
large majority of white people consider themselves Christians. On the
other hand, a large majority of dissidents long for a return to
tradition. There is no reason why religion should not be an integral
part of dissident politics, even if many dissidents are not religious.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
