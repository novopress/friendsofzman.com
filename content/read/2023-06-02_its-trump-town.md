Like many on this side of the great divide, I am not looking forward to
the Republican primary, especially the war between Trump and DeSantis.
There is a chance that it fizzles before it gets going, as DeSantis is
way back in the polls. Ron DeSantis is more of a concept at this point.
He is an alternative to Trump, but not the rejection of Trump, so people
are free to imagine him as they please.

His first big hurdle will be his lack of personality. Those people who
like him because he is Trumpism without Trump will be surprised to learn
that the concept made flesh looks and sounds a lot like Michael Dukakis.
It is entirely possible that once those voters get a look at him on the
stump, they lose interest. This is what happened to Scott Walker in the
2016 primary. His first impression was his last impression.

Given the longshot odds for any Republican in the current year, I wonder
if the action does not end up on the other side of the race. Biden has
been stuck at 40% in the approval polls for a long time. Most Democrat
primary voters, according to polls, would prefer another option. His
declining health is one part, but he was never genuinely popular in his
own party. He is the result of shenanigans.

At this point, Robert Kennedy is at 15% in the polls. Without anyone
knowing anything about him, that is a good starting spot. There is a
substantial antiwar vote on the Democrat side that has to be unhappy
with what they are seeing. All of those Bernie Bros are still there in
the shadows. The regime is trying to close off the Kennedy run before it
gets momentum, but that may not be possible.

Joe Biden falling over on stage the other day brought back memories of
Jimmy Carter facing another Kennedy in the 1980 primary. Carter won
mostly because people still remembered that Ted Kennedy killed Mary Jo
Kopechne by leaving her to drown in the backseat of his Oldsmobile. For
his part, Carter was one mishap after another throughout the process,
constantly reminding people that he was a loser.

We may be seeing this with Biden. It was not just that he toppled over
on the stage, but that he could not get up without help. He looked like
the old people they use in those commercials for
[LifeCall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I've_fallen,_and_I_can't_get_up!).
We will see more of these incidents, as Biden is a frail old man
struggling to get through each day. It is possible that this summer,
Robert Kennedy catches fire as a way for Democratic voters to voice
their unrest.

You also have to wonder if Gavin Newsome is not having second thoughts.
He was sniffing around last year looking for support to run a primary
challenge. Maybe the oligarchs who actually run things will take a look
at him as a way to drain support from Kennedy, but also as an
alternative to Biden. The next month or two could turn out to be the
more interesting story to watch in this election.
