*<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;">Employees
with degrees in fields like English, general studies, and graphic design
are among the most likely to report feeling “underemployed” at their
current jobs. This is according to a

*Liberal arts majors (I’m one of them!) are used to being the
punchline in jokes about un- and underemployment. But more unexpectedly,
majorities of graduates with more “practical” degrees in fields like
business administration also said their jobs didn’t put their education,
training or experience to work as much as they should.*

What is left out is the fact there are maybe 1,000 business majors for
every one physics major, maybe more. According to <a
href="http://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/undergrad/bachdegrees-p-10.pdf"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this paper</a>, physics majors
are 0.36% of all undergrad degrees. Frankly, that seems high, but they
include minors in the total. The point being that the typical business
major is wasting his time and money getting a degree in business. Unless
he is also getting a degree in accounting, he is learning nothing of
value in college.

The sad truth is we turned college into a quasi-IQ test. If you get into
Harvard, it means you have a top-5% IQ or your parents are loaded. Young
people at state colleges are paying $50K to get a piece of paper that
tells future employers they can sit still, follow directions and have
basic literacy and numeracy. The private school degree adds the claim of
an above average IQ. It also costs $100K for the diploma.

We really would be better off letting employers administer IQ tests
again. Blacks would not like it, but employers will still need to have
vibrancy. Passing a literacy test freely offered by an employer beats
paying a college $50K for it. It certainly beats having a trillion
dollar student debt bubble that is about to burst.
