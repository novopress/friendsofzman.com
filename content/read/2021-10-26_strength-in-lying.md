Legend has it that the Persian King Xerxes was confident in his ability
to crush the Greeks because he saw them as dishonest men. They lied to
one another in their marketplace and in their debates over politics and
law. From the perspective of the Persians, a people who allegedly viewed
lying as the worst crime possible, this defect would undermine their
efforts to resist the Persians. Men who cannot trust one another cannot
defend one another when under attack.

We know Xerxes was wrong, if he indeed thought these things. Much of our
history of the time comes from Herodotus, who was not afraid to gild the
lily when rerecording the history of the Greeks and her enemies. It is a
useful insight, however, as the market-based society is, when you think
about it, a system where the rewards go to those who are best at
deceiving their fellow citizens. More accurately, status comes from
deceiving people into thinking you are being honest with them.

The marketplace for goods and services is where sellers misrepresent
their goods in order to maximize profit. Sellers exaggerate key features
and do not disclose possible defects to potential buyers. On the other
hand, the buyer will misrepresent his interests and make claims about
finding a better deal from another seller. Both sides haggle trying to
take advantage of the other. The dynamic of the marketplace is a game of
liar’s poker where cleverness and deceit are rewarded.

Democratic politics is just taking the marketplace idea and applying it
to the governance of the society. The sellers are the people with ideas
for how to solve problems in society and the buyers are the majority who
vote on it. The game is to convince the mob there is a problem and that
you have the solution. Being right about the problem or the solution is
unimportant. What gets rewarded is convincing fifty percent plus one to
go along with your scheme, which makes you the winner.

The recent trial balloon launched by the inner party regarding a wealth
tax is a good example of how the lying game works. The idea being
floated is that billionaires will be subjected to a new tax that applies
to their unrealized capital gains. They will pay a tax based on the
potential profit from the sale of certain assets. Presumably, this will
apply only to equities, the market value of which can be determined by
the current trading price at the time the tax is assessed.

Right away, you see that everything about this is a lie. For starters,
how does one determine if you are a billionaire? It is easy when it
comes to oligarchs like Jeff Bezos, but further down the list it gets
less clear. Calculating net worth is not as straight forward at this
level as most assume. Of course, avoiding the tax will spawn an industry
to help the rich hide their assets from this tax. Since that exists in
other areas, this tax is a boon to the financial schemers who currently
serve the rich.

Then you have the impracticality of the idea. When would the tax be
levied, and would it be levied on the same asset every year? If you buy
a stock in 2021 and it goes up ten percent, you get taxed on the ten
percent. If it goes up again in 2022, do you pay a tax on it again or
just the increase in 2022? What happens when you pay the tax on
unrealized gains that disappear the day after you paid the tax? What
about assets held in family trusts? Do they get taxed as well?

The point here is that this is a nutty idea simply on the grounds that
it is a wildly complicated solution to a problem that is simple to
address. If you really want the rich to pay more tax, you tax them at a
higher rate. Treating all income equally is the most straightforward and
honest solution. Those gains and losses from investment activity are
just another line in the income section of the tax return. Imputed
income like stock options is just another entry on the W2.

Of course, this will never become law. It is just a sop to the mouth
breathers on the far left who operate on massive corporate platforms
while pretending to be anti-capitalists and socialists. It also allows
the
[zombies](https://twitter.com/robbystarbuck/status/1452476052362735621)
in Conservative Inc. to come out from under their beds and do their
libertarian dance. They get to put on the thin tie, throw on the Flock
of Seagulls cassette and carry on like it is 1985. It is party night at
the museum where everyone gets to pretend the outside world does not
exist.

Everything about this drama is a lie, because it is just a drama. It is
a story being told to arouse the passions of the crowd so they stop
thinking about things that should matter to them, like the fact that
gasoline prices have doubled, or their government lied about the Covid
pandemic for two years. This is the nature of democratic politics. The
winners are just the best liars. The losers never lose anything. They
just have to come up with better lies so they can get another crack at
the lying game.

A culture built around rewarding the most devious and dishonest is going
to get more of the devious and dishonest. Assuming Herodotus was right
about Xerxes, it was an important insight about the nature of democracy.
The marketplace society is inevitably a society full of liars. On the
other hand, the factious Greeks, and their penchant for lying, did beat
the Persians. They did not just defend their lands, they dominated the
Persians on land and sea, despite the numerical disadvantages.

It may be that a hidden strength of the marketplace is that because no
one can trust anyone and there is no neutral arbiter to enforce
honestly, everyone has to be on their game all the time. Therefore, it
boils off those who are less clever and less able to live by their own
wits. The cost to the collective strength that comes from the lack of
trust is less than the benefit that comes from stronger individual
members. Deracinated clever liars are better than united trusting
morons.

That may be why democracy is such a violent form of government. The
Greeks were always fighting with one another and then with the Persians.
America is a hyper-violent empire that is always looking to wage war.
Perhaps the hidden cost of that hidden strength of the market it is
needs an enemy to bind the parts together. The reason liberal democracy
looks a lot like fascism is the only way to bind the sticks together is
with enemies, real and imagined.
