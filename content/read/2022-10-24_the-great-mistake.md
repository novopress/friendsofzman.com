**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/cancel-cultures-first-victim/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up and this week I
decided to change gears and write about a past hero of the cause. Sunday
Thoughts was on break while I was away at a secret handshake meeting,
but I have posted some travelogues. I will be posting some more detailed
information about the event this week so if you do not have a

Over the weekend news began to leak out about a series of calls between
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his counterparts in Turkey,
The United States, France and Great Britain. The purpose of these calls,
reportedly initiated by the Russians, was to <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/23/russias-defense-chief-warns-of-dirty-bomb-provocation.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">warn</a> of the possible Ukrainian use of
a radioactive bomb, a dirty, bomb, in the coming days or weeks. The
point of the bomb was to escalate the war in order to force NATO to
directly intervene in the conflict.

The Russians also reportedly said they had intelligence that the
Ukrainians were getting help on this project from the British. It is
largely assumed that it was the British that provided the intelligence
and logistics to smuggle the truck bomb onto the Kerch Bridge  two weeks
ago. It is also assumed that the British helped the assassin with the
murder of Alexander Dugin’s daughter. The British have been intimately
involved with the war since the very beginning.

Interestingly, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace denied the claims
but then quickly added that the Russians should not use this thing they
deny is happening as a pretext for escalating the war. The American
version of this bit of double-speak was almost identical, suggesting
some level of cooperation. Given that various Biden administration
officials have been claiming the Russians will use nukes on Ukraine,
this has the look of the kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

Another clue about what is really going on is the fact that former CIA
director General Petraeus has been sent on a public relations tour to
prepare the media for the entry of American troops into Ukraine. <a
href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/03/us-would-destroy-putins-forces-if-he-uses-nukes-petraeus/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> he is three weeks ago talking
about a hypothetical that no one considered plausible at the time. <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ukraine-news-russia-us-army-101st-airborne-nato-war-games-romania/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is a story about the 101st
Airborne training in Poland for the purpose of joining the fighting in
Ukraine. In other words, the narrative makers in the West have been hard
at work.

Interestingly, the Ukrainians were not ready for their usual story
telling and had to scramble in response to the Russian calls to the
West. Zelensky does not do anything without permission from his Western
advisors who are always in the room with him, so it would seem the
Russians caught everyone by surprise, not only with the calls but with
making sure they got into Western media. Zelensky then came out with the
claim that the Russians planned to nuke themselves as a false flag.

One cannot help but detect a pattern with the false flag business. The
Ukrainians claimed the Russians killed Dugin’s daughter as a false flag.
They claimed the bombing of the Nord Stream pipelines was a Russian
false flag. They made the same claim about the Kerch Bridge and the
shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plan, which is held by the
Russians. Someone in the Zelensky media team has a bizarre obsession
with this particular narrative structure.

Putting that aside, we have two competing stories. The Russians, who
have repeatedly ruled out using nuclear weapons, but have been warning
that this war could easily escalate to nuclear conflict, are saying that
the Ukrainians are planning to use a dirty bomb and blame it on Russia.
The West is saying they are totally innocent and it is the Russians who
are planning to use a dirty bomb on themselves and then use that as an
excuse to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

If you are inclined to believe what you hear from Washington and their
media organs, you will want to accept their version of this story. If
you are skeptical of the people who lie to you every day about the most
trivial matters, then you are probably thinking that the Russians are
telling the truth. It is impossible to know the truth at this point, but
one should always leave open the possibility of a third option. Both
sides could simply be psyoping one another on this issue.

Regardless of the truth, it reveals a serious problem for the West. They
have pushed all of their chips into the middle of the table, betting on
the prospects of a deeply corrupt country run by a narcissistic
sociopath. The one thing everyone can agree upon is Zelensky is just an
actor hired to play the role of president. This is the role of a
lifetime for him and he has thrown himself into completely. Much now
depends on the mood of an actor high on the attention of a global
audience.

Tucker Carlson touched on this last week when he highlighted the absurd
demands being made by Zelensky. This pint-sized potentate is calling
Western media demanding that he be supplied hundreds of billions in aid.
If an American mayor or governor made a tiny fraction of these demands
he would be pilloried. It has somehow become completely normal for this
nut to demand massive sacrifices from Western people in order to
perpetuate a war with Russia.

This is not without president. America’s unconditional commitment to
Israel has led to several disastrous wars against Islam. Officially, the
Afghan war cost $2.3 trillion and the total bill for the neocon wars is
$5.8 trillion. Not all of this can be laid at the feet of the Israelis,
or the Saudis, who also played a role in these wars, but it is the
danger that comes when large countries make open ended commitments to
defend small countries in their wars with other countries.

The Founders strongly opposed these sorts of foreign commitments.
Washington explained the danger of “entangling alliances” in his
<a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">farewell address</a>. John Quincy Adams
<a
href="https://speakola.com/political/john-quincy-adams-house-of-representatives-foreign-monsters-4th-july-1821"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">echoed</a> those same sentiments a
generation later. When a nation considers another nation a friend, it
inevitably takes on the friends and enemies of that nation, which
inevitably warps the decision making of the country, putting the
interests of foreigners ahead of the people.

It is important to remember that the last two European wars were due in
large part to great powers aligning with minor powers. It is fair to
argue that war with German was inevitable, but the British commitment to
the Poles certainly guaranteed it. Western commitments to Ukraine look a
lot like the same error. Nuclear war now hinges on the mood of an
emotionally unstable circus performer. The so called great powers are
now led around by a tiny corrupt backwater.

This will not end well.
