The habit of rewriting history to fit current narratives is generally
associated with the far-Left, but the so-called conservatives do their
share of it as well. The early history of Buckley conservatism, for
example, has been deliberately forgotten. More important, the people
associated with the alternatives to Buckley’s individualistic brand of
conservatism have been forgotten. The current narrative says the only
alternative to coercive collectivism was the lonely individualism of
Bill Buckley.

As a result, Russell Kirk gets little mention from modern conservatives.
He has been written out of the history of their movement, in the same
way Stalin would have former allies airbrushed out of photographs. He
was never purged from the movement, like the paleocons, but he has
largely been forgotten. No one in the National Review scene bothers to
reexamine the rivalry between Frank Meyer and Russell Kirk, as to do so
would raise uncomfortable questions about their cult leader, Bill
Buckley.

It is a funny thing about Buckley conservatism. The truly brilliant
people associated with the movement were eventually purged or abandoned.
Joe Sobran, Sam Francis and Pat Buchanan are examples of men purged from
the movement, because they dared challenge the cult of Bill Buckley.
Kirk, on the other hand, was forgotten, a bad reminder of what should
have been. There’s at least one good book on the people Buckley finked
on during his long career as leader of the conservative movement.

How relevant Russell Kirk is to our current age is debatable. In fact,
European conservatism in general may have little salience in the
demographic age. The defense of the Occident against the demographic
tsunami is not served by a steadfast refusal to consider innovation or a
rethinking of the current order. Not only has too much been lost for
conservatism to make sense, the challenges we face are entirely
different from anything imagined in the past by conservative thinkers.

Even so, Russell Kirk was a brilliant political observer and analyst. He
has a lot to tell us about what went wrong with the Right and the fight
against radicalism. Given that the people we associate with the Left
will keep trying to pull the roof down on Western civilization until
they are stopped, there is a lot to be learned from the failed efforts
by the Buckleyites in the last century. The old guys of traditionalism
can tell us much about what not to do when forming up an alternative.

The other value in going back and reading the old school conservatives
from the last century is that it shows how the old political spectrum
was mostly about keeping the interested parties on the Left and Right in
charge of the debate. Any challenge to Buckley on the Right was classed
as beyond the pale. Any challenge from the Left was classed as a
Bolshevism. The bad uncles of the 20th century become the two poles,
slowly narrowing the field until we arrived at neo-liberalism.

The old bipolar way of imagining the political universe may have had its
uses in various times and places, but it is not a universal. Russell
Kirk would have thought fascism just as reckless and immoral as
communism. That’s true of the paleocons, who were accused of being
fascists as they were hooted out of the movement. The way forward for
modern dissidents starts with abandoning the old bipolar political
spectrum as a relic of a bygone era. There is no Right and Left, just
the great divide.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
