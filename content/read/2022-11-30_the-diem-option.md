be thinking about sending a few bucks to a worthy cause. If you are an
HBD fan or a supporter of academic integrity, you should consider
kicking in a few bucks to the Bryan Pesta fundraiser that you can learn

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the autumn of 1963, the Kennedy administration was made aware of a
plot against the president of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem. There had
been growing unhappiness within the elite of South Vietnam over his
handling of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_crisis" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Buddhist crisis</a> and the Viet Cong insurgency.
Earlier in the year a plot had been hatched by junior officers, but it
had been suppressed. This new plot had the support of the generals.

Unhappy with Diem’s leadership, the Kennedy administration, upon
learning of the pending coup, sent a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_243" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">cable</a> to the American ambassador in Vietnam, Henry
Cabot Lodge, instructing him to inform Diem of their unhappiness with
him and to let the generals know that they would not intervene in a coup
attempt. This, in effect, gave Washington’s stamp of approval to the
plot.

On November 1, 1963, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_South_Vietnamese_coup"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">coup</a> was launched, led by General
Duong Van Minh, the senior general in the army and the main coup
plotter. Diem’s loyalists were quickly scooped up by the army and then
Diem and his brother were arrested. Instead of just deposing him, which
was the plan communicated to the American government, both were executed
in the back of an America armored personnel carrier.

The reason that this long forgotten bit of 20th century trivial still
matters is it led directly to what Americans refer to as the Vietnam
War. Instead of realizing that they had no idea what they were doing in
that part of the world, the Kennedy administration plunged the country
into a guerilla war in Asia. The result was a calamity for both the
military and the political class of the United States.

In one of life’s great ironies, the people who cut their political teeth
in the domestic revolts over the Vietnam War now find themselves in the
same situation. This time they are the people in charge and the client
state is Ukraine. Similar to 60 years ago, the American government has
to deal with an erratic and reckless leader who may not be long for this
world. That leader is Volodymyr Zelensky.

Contrary to all of the happy talk in Western media, the proxy war
against Russia is not going well for the West. On the battlefield, the
Russians are slowly grinding down the Ukrainian army, which has become a
blackhole for Western arms. Everyone is waiting for the winter offensive
that the Russians have been planning for months. This promises to put
the Ukrainian army in an even more difficult position.

The Russians are also systematically dismantling the infrastructure of
Ukraine with waves of missile and drone strikes. The Ukrainians have no
way to defend against these attacks and contrary to the predictions of
Western planners, the Russians are no where near running out of
missiles. If anything, it appears they have ramped up their production
of missiles and drones.

This promises to unleash a humanitarian disaster on the rest of Europe
as Ukrainians flee the collapse of their country. Current estimates say
that as many as eight million Ukrainians could make their way to Europe
this winter. Europe is teetering on the abyss economically because of
soaring energy and food costs, so waves of migrants from Ukraine could
not come at a worse time.

This is where the Zelensky – Diem comparison comes into play. Like Diem,
Zelensky is becoming a serious problem for Washington. They built him
into a folk hero who must be supported at all costs. The trouble is
Zelensky is a loose cannon who seems to be hell bent on escalating the
war. The most recent example is the Ukrainian missile that landed in
Poland. Zelensky still insists it was the Russians.

To make matters worse, Zelensky has surrounded himself with
ultranationalist and Bandera fanatics. Even if Washington could find a
way to have him agree to negotiations, the fanatics would probably kill
him. Zelensky understands this perfectly well, which is why he continues
with the overheated rhetoric. There is only one way out for him and that
is getting NATO directly involved in the war.

This is an impossibility for Washington. The military sees that the
foreign policy establishment badly miscalculated. There is zero appetite
for getting involved in a war for which NATO is clearly not prepared.
Compounding it is a growing Ukraine fatigue around the West, as the cost
of this debacle begins to bite. Not only is there no appetite for
escalation, but everyone is also growing tired of Zelensky and Ukraine.

This is where the Diem solution could become an attractive option. If
something unfortunate were to happen to Zelensky, then that would solve
a lot of problems for Washington and the collective West. They would be
free of this folk hero they created and maybe have a villain on whom
they could blame the defeat. Those nationalists around Zelensky would be
easy to characterize as the bad guys.

It may seem a bit farfetched given the way in which the collective West
has behaved over the last year, but they have no better options. Russian
public opinion has shifted steadily against negotiations. The pressure
on Putin to unleash the full fury of the Russian war machine on Ukraine
grows daily. The destruction of the Ukraine energy grid is just the
beginning of what lies ahead this winter.

This means the West has two options at this point. One is to find a way
to keep Ukraine going as a civil society, which will cost hundreds of
billions. This may not even be possible, given the complexity of the
problem. The other is to accept the inevitable collapse of Ukraine,
millions of refugees flooding into Europe and a total defeat of the
Ukrainian army. In other words, the West can bleed to death or commit
suicide.

That is why Zelensky will have to go and go soon. It offers a third way
out of this problem that allows everyone to save face. Washington can
blame the fanatics for his demise and the collapse of Ukraine. The
Europeans will be free to abandon the ruinous sanctions regime. Worst
case scenario Russia installs a new government. Best case scenario
Russia is stuck with a failed state and thousands of armed lunatics.

Whether or not there is anyone in Washington smart enough to understand
what is happening is hard to know. It may be left to the Europeans to
save Washington from itself or maybe the Ukrainians make the same error
as the Vietnamese. At some point someone with the power to make it
happen is going to figure out that the way out of this quagmire is to
get rid of Zelensky.
