We are eight days from the most important election ever, which is what
they say about every presidential election. This one could actually
turnout to be pivotal as part of the collection of presidential
elections that define the Trump era. The results next week, or the
following week if we get more shenanigans, will determine which way the
political process goes the next decade. Like him or hate him, Trump is
the most consequential political figure of this century so far.

The next week could be wild, if the past week is an indication. Trump is
scheduled to do a rally in New Mexico and in Virginia, two states no one
thought would be in play a month ago, but now may be up for grabs.
Harris is coming off one of the worst weeks in politics, but her
campaign keeps finding new ways to stumble, so this week could bring
fresh idiocy to the race. Over the weekend she was booed at an event in
Philadelphia, a thing that is becoming a thing for her.

The handicappers, even those who want Harris to win, are slowly lining
up behind the idea of a Trump victory. Everything seems to be breaking
his way right now, while everything is going wrong for Harris. Poll
after poll in key states move in Trump’s direction and now, we have
three new states in the toss-up column. New Hampshire, New Mexico and
Virginia are now in the gray zone. Whether Trump wins any of them is
still in doubt, but it is the movement that matters.

Of course, all of this is against the backdrop of 2020, where a tidal
wave of fraud made it the least trusted result since 1960. Even if you
reject the fraud claims, it was an election that featured many
never-before-seen anomalies. For example, Arizona, another swing state,
saw a 38% increase in voter turnout. In 2016, Trump won 1,252,401 votes
and in 2020 he got 1,661,686 but still lost. Overall, the 2020 election
saw the biggest spike in turnout ever and no one asks why.

We are already seeing signs of shenanigans aimed at adding enough new
ballots to the Harris pile to overcome the Trump increase. Authorities
in Lancaster County Pennsylvania unearthed a vote fraud <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14002851/pennsylvania-voter-registration-fraud-2024-election-lancaster-county.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">scheme</a>. Ballot harvesting is a form
of fraud in which runners are given pre-filled out ballots and walking
around money to then get signatures by registered voters in ghetto
areas. It starts with first getting a voter registered, whether the
voter exists or not.

What we saw in 2020 is not just about that election and the claims
surrounding it, but about understanding subsequent elections. Polling,
for example, depends on models of the electorate, which are created
using past election data. If the 2020 data is riddled with unexplained
and potentially unexplainable anomalies, how can a polling company build
a reliable model of the electorate? The answer is you cannot, and they
have no way to poll the fraud shops producing fake ballots either.

That means there are two angles to the polling. The one angle is
figuring the margin of fraud in each of these states, then adjusting the
polls accordingly. In Pennsylvania, Trump needs a two- or three-point
margin to cover the fraud. In Wisconsin, the margin of fraud is about
one point. The other angle is the polls themselves may have to be
adjusted to account for the fraud they are including in their models.
Trump consistently outperforms the polling. How much will he outperform
this time?

This is the high cost of official corruption. When it is people trying
to undermine the rules and the authorities working to stop them, the
general public can trust the results, even accepting some problems. When
it is the authorities subverting the rules for their own gain, then no
one can trust anything. This is because you have no basis of comparison,
as the base condition is assumed to be corrupt. We may never trust our
elections again due to the 2020 shenanigans.

All of that aside, you would want to be Donald Trump right now, as far
as the election, rather than Kamala Harris. An honest look at the polls,
adjusting for shenanigans, puts Trump at 262 electoral college votes and
Harris at 209. The states that are too close to call as of this writing
are WI, MI, PA, VA and NV. If New Hampshire and New Mexico are in play,
then it is worse for Harris. That means Trump needs one win to regain
the presidency, and Harris needs to run the table.

Then there is the energy. The Trump campaign is resembling the 2016
election with Trump barnstorming the country drawing massive crowds. He
was just in New York City doing an event at a sold-out Madison Square
Garden. Harris is forced to announce fake concerts to trick people into
showing up at her events. She got booed vigorously at that Houston event
as a result. The energy around the Harris campaign is all negative
energy, which is never a good thing.

There is a strong Howard Dean vibe to the Harris campaign. She has never
won a competitive race. She was handed the senate seat by the Democratic
Party machine in California because she was highly controllable. Of
course, she famously flamed out in the 2020 presidential primary. She
was handed the nomination this time when they pushed Biden over the
edge. Her entire existence as a political figure rests on a mass media
operation to conceal the reality of her support.

Of course, there is the other shenanigans. States like Michigan and
Pennsylvania rely on the party machine to “get out the vote” for the
Democrat. Both states have Democrat governors with eyes on the 2028
nomination. If Harris wins the election, then the political career of
Gretchen Whitmer and Josh Shapiro come to an end. They will be too old
and too forgotten in 2032. There are also forces in Washington who would
like to be rid of Harris and her people too.

That is why Trump is the bettering favorite right now. The betting
markets have Trump with a 62% chance of winning. All the things people
look at to determine the shape of the race favor Trump, other than the
shenanigans. This may be why the billionaire owners of the LA Times and
Washington Post told their editorial staff to cancel the Harris
endorsements. Maybe the oligarchs are sending a message to the political
class that they want to see Trump win.

The English-speaking world is sure the Chinese have a curse that says,
“May you live in interesting times.” The Chinese have no such curse, but
we assume they should, so we insist on it anyway. Regardless, we live in
an interesting time and the next two weeks, assuming more election
shenanigans, promises to be very interesting. In the fullness of time,
we may look back and say this was the most consequential election in
history or the last election in our history.
