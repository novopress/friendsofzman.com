------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have for a long time now
been wrestling with a problem that is truly novel. They find themselves
in an interest rate trap, which means they need to restore borrowing
rates to something close to the historic norm, but doing so puts the
global banking system at risk. The political class is just as hooked on
cheap money as the bankers, so their is no appetite for a Paul Volker
like approach to solving the money problem in the West.

For a long time, the problems were abstract. Everyone knew that near
zero interest rates would one day create big problems, but in the here
and now they made all of the important people happy. The reckless and
insane response to Covid by Western ruling classes moved the problem
into the domain of reality. Massive spending by government put enormous
amounts of cash into the hands of regular people, not just the bankers,
and those regular people started spending it.

Compounding this was the decline in global demand for dollars. Since the
1990’s, the Chinese economy was able to soak up extra dollars and euros.
Other parts of Asia could also be counted on to take dollars in the form
of investment. The massive liquidity in the banking system was, in
effect, sequestered from the retail economy of Western countries, so the
impact was low. That and the rest of the world was happy to hold euros,
dollars and bonds in those currencies.

Covid was an accelerant in many ways, but one very important way was in
regards to the Chinese economy. Central to the long term plans of China
is to boost domestic demand and reduce her dependence on exports to the
West. Lock downs and the subsequent decline in global commerce
accelerated the process. China came out of Covid with far less demand
for Western investment. Those extra dollars and euros are retuning to
their makers.

It is looking like the insane response by the collective West to the war
in the Ukraine is another accelerant to a process that was slowly
building steam. Cutting Russia off from the “rules based international
order” was a wake up call for the large, non-Western economies of the
world. China understood right away that the dollar was Washington’s
primary weapon in international affairs. The Saudis also came to see the
problem with depending upon Washington to abide by the rules.

More important, the Russian economy survived the assault by Washington
and she successfully defended the ruble. When Russia demanded payment in
rubles from Western nations and they went along with it, the world
changed. All of a sudden, the multipolar world with multiple competing
currencies came into focus. China, Russia, India and the OPEC countries
have now set off on a path where the dollar and euro no longer have a
special place in global trade.

The enormity of this politically and economically cannot be overstated.
This week the ruler of China is making a visit to Moscow. Generations of
American policy makers have worked to avoid this meeting, but the
current crop in charge of American foreign policy wrecked all of that
and now we have an alliance between Russia and China. The world’s
largest economy is now a strategic partner with the world’s biggest
nuclear power, in opposition to the Global American Empire.

The global realignment does not stop there. The Russians have been
brokering a peace between the Turks and the Syrians. The goal is to
squeeze out the Americans, who are in Syria stealing Syrian oil and gas.
China has brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which promises
to reorder the region. The oil producing hub of the world is suddenly in
the orbit of China and Russia. Economics follows politics, so it is not
hard to see what this does to the dollar and euro.

For the last year, the Fed and ECB have been facing a problem. There is
far too much money in the system and the demand for their money is in
decline globally, which means they have to remove money from the system.
They tried to ignore the problem by spinning yarns about inflation being
transitory, but rocket high food bills made that story impossible to
maintain. The politicians demanded the Fed “fix” the economy for them,
so the Fed started to raise rates.

That is what brings us back to the interest rate trap. The entire
Western banking system depends on exclusive access to cheap money. This
is their margin. They no longer provide much in the way of essential
services. Much of what the banking system does could be automated at
this point. The profits come from operating a casino in which the house
arbitrages the difference between what it pays for money and what the
suckers on the other side pay for money.

If all of a sudden the price the house pays for money closes with that
which the suckers are paying, then the casino goes bust. That is what we
are see now. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were just money
laundering schemes for plutocrats. Once interest rates went up just a
little, they were no longer viable. Credit Suisse was just bailed out by
the Swiss National Bank for the same reason. These banks could only
exist in the world of free money to the banks and their clients.

Over the weekend, the Fed with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England,
the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank
<a
href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-five-central-banks-announce-210200117.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> a global bailout of the
Western banking system. They are offering unlimited cash in exchange for
the illiquid assets on the bank’s books. The reason they did this is
they know that every bank in the West has the same problem as Credit
Suisse. That is their liabilities outweigh their assets so they are
effectively broke.

Of course, you cannot fight inflation while showering the system with
cash, which means the effort to rein in inflation has come to an end.
The Fed will try to limit the swapping of bad assets for cash by
substituting treasuries, but this sort of legerdemain is just so they
can continue the game of make believe. High inflation is now the new
normal in the West because it is impossible to raise rates. The West has
turned itself into Argentina through bad policy and worse politics.

For generations now people have warned about the long term cost of
living on borrowed money, but they were mostly wrong. Living on borrowed
money is self-correcting in that the lender eventually stops lending.
What the West faces is a problem where the lender cannot not stop
lending. The only way to sustain this now is for the people to be
impoverished through systemic inflation. Inflation is now the banker’s
friend, because it promises to keep the cheap money flowing.
