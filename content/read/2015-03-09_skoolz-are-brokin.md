I don’t have a lot of interest in the education. I think humans are born
with a degree of natural intelligence. We are also born with certain
broad personality traits. Both are inherited from our ancestors. The
witch’s brew of DNA is that makes us what we are is set in the womb and
there’s not a whole lot we (or anyone else) can do about it. With
regards to education, kids will learn what kids want to learn to the
level their abilities will allow. No system will change that.

Americans of the modern age reject the above as crime-think. Everyone is
sure that the right schools, the right teachers and the right methods
can make everyone above average, as George Bush put it. A lot of this is
bound up in anti-racism, which is almost a religion all its own these
days. By focusing on the schools and the methods, it allows everyone to
ignore the students walking through the schoolroom door. Disparities in
test scores become proof that everyone must redouble their efforts to
“fix” the schools.

Anyway, <a
href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/why-im-a-public-school-teacher-but-a-private-school-parent/386797/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this was in my twitter feed the other
day</a>. It is a long description of a private school by a public school
teacher who has decided the public schools are not for his kid. The tone
suggest the author is racked with guilt and searching for some reason
why the private schools are so much better than the public school. Well,
a reason that does not touch on the taboos that make frank discussion of
education impossible. As a public school teacher, the author is required
to promote all the whack-a-doodle ideas that define public education in
America, but he loves his kid so he is in a tough spot.

The comments are hilarious as you see all the lunacy on display, with
regards to education. <a
href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/standardized-tests-suck-fix-data-not-less/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This article</a> was also in my twitter
feed. It must be education week on twitter. The general thrust is that
we need more data to come up with the perfect solution to education.
This strikes me as another way to avoid the rushing reality of the
classroom.  We have mountains of data and everyone pretty much knows the
truth, but

is why education policy is a dog’s breakfast of crackpottery.

*The whole premise of this article is wrong. School should not be
about*  
*“content”, that which can be measured with tests. Rather, it should
be*  
*about inspiring curiosity, building empathy (which can be done with*  
*mixed age, race, ethnicity and ability classrooms) and encouraging*  
*exploration and collaboration. Those elements are the essence of
what*  
*determine the quality of a human being’s life. I’m sorry to deflate*  
*Wired’s fascination with everything technological, but unless we
begin*  
*to look at education from a developmental perspective, which takes
into*  
*account not just our brain, but our 5 senses, our need for movement,*  
*choice in what we learn and when we learn it, being able to make
genuine*  
*contributions to a learning community through purposeful work, we’ll*  
*continue to chase our tails. Any by the way, if you are curious
about*  
*what type of education offers engagement in all of these…go visit an*  
*authentic Montessori classroom today. To the dismay of many of the*  
*“data advocates” reading this article, you won’t find screens but
you*  
*will see very happy, engaged children concentrating at extremely
high*  
*levels for long periods of time.*

There’s simply no way to include crazy people in the discussion without
getting batshit crazy results, which is why our pubic schools are a
dumpster fire.
