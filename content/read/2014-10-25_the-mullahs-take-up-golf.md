The autocratic core of the prevailing religion is never more obvious
than the treatment of old people. The Left hates old people almost as
much as they hate whites. It’s why their idealized future is devoid of
old people. It is also why mandatory euthanasia was a must have in
ObamaCare. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s an example</a> where the war on
white men converges with the war on old white people.

*Ted Bishop was ousted Friday as president of the PGA of America over a
sexist tweet and Facebook post directed at Ian Poulter.*

*Bishop was irritated by remarks Poulter made in his book on the Ryder
Cup captaincy of Nick Faldo in 2008 and Tom Watson this year. He
referred to Poulter as “Lil Girl” on Twitter when stacking up Poulter’s
feats next to Faldo. In a Facebook post, he noted that Watson (with
eight majors) and Faldo (with six majors and the Ryder Cup record for
most points) were getting “bashed” by Poulter.*

*“Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess.
C’MON MAN!” he wrote.*

*The PGA of America board voted Friday to remove him, meaning Bishop
will not be invited to future PGA Championships and Ryder Cups, or any
other courtesies extended to past presidents. He is the first PGA
president to be ousted. Bishop had one month left on his two-year term.*

*Bishop, who has two daughters, apologized to Poulter and “anyone else I
might have offended” in a statement.*

*But the head pro from Indiana went down swinging.*

*Bishop said his fellow PGA officers asked him to resign Friday and he
refused, wanting instead to apologize in person to the board and let the
process run its course.*

*“The board heard me out and then voted to impeach me,” he said. “That
is the due process and I respect that, as painful as it might be.”*

*In removing Bishop as president, the PGA of America board said the
remarks were inconsistent with association’s policies.*

*“The PGA of America understands the enormous responsibility it has to
lead this great game and to enrich lives in our society through golf,”
PGA chief executive Pete Bevacqua said in a statement. “We must demand
of ourselves that we make golf both welcoming and inclusive to all who
want to experience it, and everyone at the PGA of America must lead by
example.”*

They could have let the old guy leave in a month, but that would be
humane. Instead, they had him officially excommunicated and publicly
humiliated. These idiots can talk about their great until they are blue
in the face, but this is all about the demand of the Left. That comes
before everything. If the Left decides players must be sodomized on the
9th hole, the PGA will mandate it at their next meeting.
