Categories are useful, which is why humans have been using labels for
people and things since the dawn of time. Using generalizations for
people, events and things is a handy way of communicating important
things efficiently. The political terms Left and Right have been with us
since the 18th century for that reason. They are broadly useful in
describing people and ideas. In the particular they are often confusing,
but when it comes to the big categories, they work.

In 18th and 19th century Europe, the Right was those on the side of the
old aristocratic order, while the Left represented some form of liberal
alternative. The Right defended the rights of the crown against the
demands of the crowd. The Left advocated the rights of the people
against the traditions of the crown. The Left was coming at politics
from an empirical perspective. They talked about rational government.
The Right were traditionalist, often rooting their position in religion.

In the 19th and 20th century, especially in America, the terms Right and
Left were redefined around economic concepts. The Left were socialists,
embracing Marxist arguments, to one degree or another, about economics
and history. The Right was the defender of markets and free enterprise.
Those old class concepts, king and peasant, inevitably were
incorporated. The Left was on the side of the working people, the new
peasants, while the Right was on the side of business.

The limits of this new economically based politics are obvious when
looking at the early 20th century, particularly the interwar years.
Fascism is considered to be right-wing, even though all of them embraced
socialism. They also championed the workers in their organizing and
rhetoric. Communism was much more popular with the upper classes than
the working classes. Look at 20th century communism and what you see is
academics and the scions of the upper classes.

Lost in all of this is the term liberalism. In the 19th century, liberal
meant rational government rooted in natural law. The Founders were
liberals. They sought to create a political order that reflected the
people and history of the new country. They were not basing their
arguments in religion or tradition. They were debating the most rational
form of government for a land populated as it was at the time. Into the
20th century, liberal was a fairly good stand in for reason.

Fast forward to the middle of the last century and the term liberal had
been conflated with the term progressive. They had become synonyms.
Progressivism was anything but liberal in the traditional sense of the
word. The progressives rooted their ideology in New England public
Protestantism and oogily-boogily borrowed from European intellectuals of
the Hegelian tradition. Regardless of it claims, Progressivism has
always been in opposition to empiricism.

This redefinition of the word liberal is just one example of the larger
assault on the common language. It has reached the point today where no
reasonable person accepts anything said by the upper classes at face
value. The reason is they no longer use the language as defined by the
dictionary. The most recent example is the phrase “the science has
changed” which has nothing to do with science. In fact, the only thing
we can know for sure from that statement is the science has not changed.

The assault on cognitive meaning in the language and the rise of
[emotional language](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/51/e2107848118) in
public discourse is part of a larger dynamic in American political
discourse that has come to redefine Left and Right. To be on the Left is
to embrace an ideology rooted in your emotions about the topic and the
people involved in the topic. To be on the Right is to engage rationally
with a topic. Liberalism has become an assault on reason, while
illiberalism is the defense of reality.

In his book *After Liberalism*, Paul Gottfried points out that what
masquerades as liberalism in America is post-liberal. Things like
pluralism and democracy are not part of the liberal tradition. 19th
century liberals understood that not all men were invested in society,
so not all men warranted the franchise. Similarly, they understood that
all ideas were not equal or deserving of equal consideration. By
extension, the people behind those ideas were not deserving of equal
consideration.

Gottfried does not address it in his book, but one could argue that
managerialism in America is a response to the collapse of reason in the
political order. The formation of the administrative state and the
concept of managerialism were the response to the collapse of the old
constitutional order in the 19th century. These are not based in reason,
but a practical necessity. The labyrinth of bureaucracy, private and
public, that control public life exist to provide stability.

What this means is that the terms Left and Right have to reconsidered to
fit the reality of the present age. The Left is illiberal, emotional and
irrational. It is the rejection of the human condition, not in a
spiritual sense, but in an empirical sense. It is not an accident that
the people most into life-extension technology and various forms of
virtual and hyper reality are on the Left. They seek to transcend human
biology by living on forever in a new world created for them on-line.

This is why the term right-wing is cognitively meaningless. Those
holding to the old economic definition are culturally and politically
irrelevant. They oppose a political force that no longer exists. The
traditionalists have a similar problem, because much of what can be
defined as American tradition has been defined by the Left. Since
Gettysburg, the Left has controlled the culture. So much so that things
like abortion have a greater claim to tradition than opposition to it.

The greatest trick of radicalism has been to slowly lay claim to
irrationality, things like tradition, emotion and spirituality,
incorporating them into their theories of history and human
organization. Their opposition has been left with sterile facts and
figures or claims to tradition that no longer have emotional energy. The
American Left is irrationality in the guise of science, emotion draped
in the garb of reason, illiberalism wearing the costume of liberal
governance.

Getting back to the terms Right and Left, the great crisis on the Right
is rooted in the fact that the Right does not exist. It does not exist
because it does not understand what it opposes or even if it opposes the
Left. Until people desiring an alternative to the prevailing orthodoxy
come to terms with the moral and linguistic reality of the prevailing
orthodoxy, there can be no cognitive opposition. You have to know what
you oppose, before you can explain why you oppose it.

As a practical matter, the West is now in a pre-Enlightenment period.
This is why our age looks so much like late feudalism with better stuff.
In 17th century France, there was no Right because there was no Left.
There were just the way things were. Today, there is no Left or Right
for the same reason. There is the prevailing orthodoxy with its
established hierarchy and a bunch of disaffected peasants. The
Right-Left dichotomy no longer exists practically or theoretically.
