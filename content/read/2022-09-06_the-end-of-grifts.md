Eric Hoffer famously said that what starts out in America as a mass
movement ends up as a racket, a cult, or a corporation. As we saw with
Covid, it can often be all of these things at the same time. When Hoffer
made this observation, mass media was still in the analog age, so things
moved slower. A movement would linger for while in the corporate stage
before devolving into a racket. In the digital age, these things can
happen simultaneously and instantaneously.

The reason for this is America is not an actual country, like France or
Sweden, but an open outdoor bazaar held together by a merchant class. As
Coolidge supposedly said, the business of America is business. That
means everything is treated as a business, even things that should never
be a business. It is the worship of the marketplace where everyone
assumes the right answer will magically arise from the transactions that
occur in the marketplace. The invisible hand is our god.

The trouble is, there are things that are true that people would like to
think are not true, so those market results will be at odds with
reality. There are things in every society that should never be exposed
to market forces. They are too important to let the fickle mobs in the
marketplace decide. In theory, this is supposed to be a bedrock
assumption of the American form of government. There are things like
natural rights that are beyond the reach of the political process.

The corrosive effect of marketism on the political process is clear in
the political industrial complex that has consumed the political system.
Billions are made every election cycle in politics. What should be a
straightforward process whereby the parties and candidates make their
case to the voters, is instead run by a massive political industry of
consultants, advisers, technicians and the media. All of these people
are in the process to make money from politics.

<a href="https://spectator.org/gop-ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> is a useful example in a legacy site called the
American Spectator. The post is an argument in favor of something called
rank choice voting. This a system that requires voters to list their
preferred candidates in order of preference. The first choices are then
counted up and you get the normal total. In some systems, if no
candidate gets fifty percent of the vote, then the second choices are
tallied up and added to the candidates total. In other systems, this is
automatic.

There are two rather obvious problems with this system. One is it adds a
layer of complexity to the voting system. A central tenet of all
democratic systems, even those that limit the role of voting, is that
voting is clear and open. In the rank choice voting systems, you can get
a minority candidate winning the election, despite most people voting
for some other option. Put another way, it is not clear to the users of
the system how their inputs will affect the outputs of the system.

Therein lies the other problem. This added complexity becomes a bonanza
for the army of grifters in the political system. Now that the social
media consultant racket has run its course, they get to jump on the
ranked choice voting scam. You can be sure that all of the pinheads with
“social media influencer’ in their bio are now thinking about removing
the Ukraine flag so they can make room for the letters RCV. This
“innovation” is quickly becoming both a racket and a business.

The proof of this assertion is the man behind that post. According to
his <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/people/eric-wilson" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">bio</a>, Eric Wilson is a digital-first political
strategist based in Washington, DC. He was a Technology and Democracy
Fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation,
located at the Harvard Kennedy School. In other words, his post at The
American Spectator is simply advertising for his services. Ranked choice
voting, according to Eric Wilson, is good for the people, because it is
profitable for him.

It cannot be emphasized enough just how terrible ranked choice voting is
for a country that is quickly losing trust in its systems. With normal
voting it takes some jurisdictions weeks to count the vote. The Alaska
election he holds up as a great example took weeks to sort out after the
election. Imagine that in a big corrupt state like California or New
York. It will take years to resolve an election. There are still court
cases going on over the 2020 presidential election.

Of course, this can only add to the sense that voting is rigged. Every
innovation, like mail in voting, early voting, ballot harvesting and
drop box voting has come with an observable increase in shenanigans. The
states at the center of the 2020 election scandal were states that
suddenly embraced innovated voting methods. Imagine a state like
Pennsylvania suddenly switching to ranked choice voting a week before
the election and you have the beginnings of armed revolt.

Of course, the promise of chaos is exactly why the consultant class want
yet another way to muddy the waters on election day. Chaos is good for
business. The fact that it is bad for the health of society is besides
the point. Those racks of donuts are not going to buy themselves, so
that means Eric Wilson needs steady work. If that work is bad for the
people, well, too bad for them. They should have figured out a way to
grift on the collapse of their country like Eric Wilson.

This is the problem with marketism. When everything must be exposed to
the marketplace, everything quickly becomes a racket. When the
governance of your country becomes a racket, you no longer have a
country. That is why the people at the top of the racket so fiercely
oppose anything that looks like community. It offers an alternative
morality to that of marketism. If people begin to put something ahead of
making a quick buck, the market could collapse.

That is where things are headed. Politics is a massive racket run by
conmen, grifters and sociopaths who care only about a quick buck. The
system staggers on because of the cultural inertia behind it, but
eventually, it must succumb. There are also ideologues that take
advantage of this to push their agenda. We see that with the neocons and
their efforts to blow up the world. With no one in power interested in
the wellbeing of the system, the system will eventually collapse.
