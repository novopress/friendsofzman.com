An old and mostly true observation about revolutions is that they end up
where they started with a new set of rulers doing pretty much the same
things as the rulers they deposed in the revolution. Stalin was the Tsar
decorated with the ideological trappings of the revolution. Napoleon was
a secular version of the Sun King. The people hiding behind razor wire
and armed men this weekend in the imperial capital are the
authoritarians they claimed to have deposed last election.

One reason, maybe, for this is that changing the culture that created
the old leaders is not as easy as the revolutionaries imagine. The
character of a people is the product of many generations. The unwritten
rules of society are simply second nature, habits of mind that no one
needs to consider. Changing a lifetime of habit is not easy with one
person but changing a population’s lifetime of habit is impossible. The
best the revolution can do is change the people at the top.

That is what we are seeing in America. The long march through the
institutions has not produced the glorious revolution, because altering
the character of the people is not simply a matter of blasting new
culture from the institutions. It turns out that the cultural Marxist
were wrong, and culture does not emanate from institutions. The
institutions are the product of the culture. Even adding lots of new
people fails because those people bring their culture with them.

That does not mean the cultural revolution is harmless. For example,
they have turned patriotism into a weapon. Our choice is flag waving,
which means supporting the destructive ends of Conservative Inc., or
flag burning, which means supporting the monstrous ends of Progressive
Inc. Of course, the point of patriotism, the preservation of our land
and people becomes increasingly impossible. What is natural and good
gets twisted into a weapon used against the patriotic.

Altruism is another virtue turned into a vice. Since white people are
not permitted to cheer for their own side, their natural altruism has
one outlet. White people are conditioned to link their happiness to the
happiness of nonwhites. A visitor from another planet would assume the
white people in this area of the planet worship the black people and
that George Floyd was some sort of prophet. Altruism has been warped
into what John Derbyshire calls ethno-masochism.

These are thorny topics, because most people correctly sense that loving
your country and caring about other people are good things. They are
good things, but they are channeled toward bad ends by our present
rulers. Battling this is one of the most important challenges in this
age, but it is easier said than done. These are two issues where there
are no simple answers. The best we can do is keep working the problem
until conditions are such that an answer materializes from the conflict.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
