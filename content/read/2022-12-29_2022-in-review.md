**Note:** For those looking for a direct response to Michael Anton’s
unprovoked attack on me can find it behind it behind the green door. I
posted it there as having a sub should have value beyond extra content.

The one sure way to look like a genius when making predictions is to say
the upcoming year will make the closing year look relatively calm. The
reason is that recency bias works in favor of such a prediction.
Everyone thinks now is crazier than the past, because they mostly forgot
about how they felt in the past. The other reason it works in this age
is things are getting increasingly weird.

That is one I can put in the win column. The theme to last year’s
predictions was that things would get crazier and that is objectively
true. While I did not specifically call Kanye West becoming America’s
leading white nationalist, the mere fact that it happened confirms that
we have reached a new level of crazy. We do not live in interesting
times. We live in an age of general lunacy.

This cuts both ways. In an age of lunacy, you feel free to make bold
improbable predictions about what comes next, because why not? My call
on Biden was crazy but having a dementia patient in the White House is
crazier still. Why not have a palace coup to remove him and the DMV
lady? That turned out to be all wrong as Biden and DMV lady seem to be
permanent fixtures now.

I got the international scene wrong as well, mostly because I did not go
anywhere near bold enough in my predictions. I always underestimate the
lunacy of the neocons, mostly because normal people never fully grasp
evil. It turns out to have been a wackier year internationally than I
thought was possible. In this regard, 2022 will be remembered as a
momentous year for the world.

I also got the midterms wrong, at least partially wrong. I thought I was
going out on a limb with that one, but it turned out to be too cautious.
I thought demographics and disgust would begin to catch up with the
Republicans, but not as quickly as it seems to be happening. Turnout
took a hit in 2022 compared to previous midterms and it was almost all
on the Republican side of things.

With regards to elections, 2022 may go down as the year when people
internalized the wholesale corruption in the system. Among normal people
it is now assumed that our elections are rigged. Some take it too far
and there are the grifters like Dinesh D’Souza trying to monetize the
cynicism, but most normal people now accept that our elections are no
longer on the level. That is not a small thing.

Probably the biggest miss for the year was my predictions for myself. I
did not escape Lagos and I did not finish my book. It was a year of big
changes and those changes threw a wrench in my plans. When you have a
tight schedule, change almost always means a deleterious disruption in
the work schedule. My early prediction for next year is that I will
remain behind on everything.

On the positive side of things, I did get the economics right. I hit the
Bitcoin and equities markets calls pretty much on the nose, so to speak.
I said Bitcoin would lose 50% of its value and it lost a bit more than
that over the year. I was a little aggressive on the stock market, but
that was due to de-dollarization globally. Those dollars have to go
somewhere so they went into stocks late in the year.

Probably the best call of the year was the continued decline of
Conservative Inc. and its media organs. This is something not getting a
ton of attention, but official conservatism is on its way to the dustbin
of history. When Claremont grandees are referencing dissident writers,
you know that behind the scenes there is a great deal of handwringing
about what is happening among the Dirt People.

The same can be said for the media as a whole. It is looking like Donald
Trump was to the media what the compact disc was for music. People
repurchased their music inventory on the new format, which masked the
real decline in the market. The same was true of Trump. People paid
attention to the media because he was at war with the media, but now
that he is gone, interest in mass media has collapsed.

Every year, the biggest misses in the prediction game are the things
that happened which no one imagined happening. No one saw Ukraine
becoming a global struggle to keep the American empire alive well past
its expiry date. Some predicted war in Ukraine and some even thought it
would carry on for a while, but no one saw the great proxy war for the
survival of the American empire as a result.

Similarly, no one saw the Twitter fiasco coming. Even now, no one is
noting the elite war on Elon Musk for his apostacy. They have been
attacking the value of his companies in an effort to punish him for his
Twitter takeover. Of course, no one thought that an advocate for child
molestation would turn out to be their chief censor. No one thought the
FBI was integrated into Twitter either.

That may be the biggest miss of 2022. Most American have now learned
that there is a secret police in America and they spend most of their
time spying on Americans and manipulating what they see and hear. When
establishment figures like Victor Davis Hanson are
[shocked](https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/25/what-will-the-fbi-not-do/)
by what has been revealed about the FBI, you know we have turned some
important corner in the life of the country.

In the end, it was a strange year. Maybe it will be viewed as a pivotal
year or simply part of a pivotal moment that started in 2015 when Trump
came down the escalator. The one thing we can be sure about is 2023 will
be even stranger than 2022. The trick is in imagining something that
seems impossible today, and then think about how it could become
normalized by this time next year.
