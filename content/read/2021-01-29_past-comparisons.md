Way back in the old days, politicians in trouble with their voters would
often be described as “tone deaf” by their less harsh critics. They were
in trouble because they no longer had the ability to hear how they
sounded to their voters. They would say things that were maybe
acceptable behind closed doors in Washington but should never be said in
public. Maybe they were prone to saying true things that were best left
unsaid or that confirmed things people suspected about the guy.

That is not an expression you hear these days. No one care about how one
sounds to the Dirt People, as that no longer matters. What really
matters is how you sound to the Cloud People, a lesson Donald Trump
learned. The media no longer talks about this either, as they are just
as self-absorbed as the rest of them. The result is our politics is now
constructed behind soundproof glass. On one side are the politics
actors, performing their routines to piped-in cheers from the crowd.

On the other side of the glass is the rest of us, watching an
increasingly bizarre political theater performed by increasingly
grotesque actors. One performance this week was the arrest of Douglass
Mackey, the pro-Trump on-line personality who played the role of Ricky
Vaughn on Twitter back in 2016. He was arrested and charged with the
crime of disrespecting the regime. The weirdos on the other side of the
glass now think it is a good idea to arrest people who hurt their
feelings.

The other show was the collusion between the Biden White House and some
hedge fund pirates to prevent retail investors from making money at
their expense. Instead of letting a few of these guys sink to teach the
rest a lesson, the regime swept in and forced the trading platforms to
manipulate the market so the bog players could get out from under their
bad bets. We literally saw the head of NASDAQ say that they had to
manipulate the market so big players could be protected.

This is what the old guys used to call tone deaf. Of course, in our new
woke society, “tone deaf” is probably the name of the new Secretary of
Housing. Putting that aside, for no reason other than spite the regime
convinced millions of people that they no longer have first amendment
rights, and the financial markets are every bit as crooked as their
elections. They are doing this at the same time they are babbling about
the need for unity after they rigged the last election.

It really is an amazing time to be alive. Most people reading this are
over forty, so you remember when it was radicals on the college campus
claiming that America was a lie and that a cabal of sinister players
really ran the country. The people saying this never ventured off the
college campus and were happy to live off the system, but they were sure
the system was a lie. Now, those people are in charge and not only were
they right about the system being a lie, it is normal people saying it
now.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
