I’m back in Lagos so this episode was recorded in my state of the art
studio, which is my bedroom and a $200 microphone. I got a lot of
feedback from friends about the podcast last week. They had plenty of
suggestions, but everyone says the sound quality is perfect the way it
is and I should not change a thing. It’s a good reminder that good
enough is usually good enough. It’s easy to lose sight of that, because
we always think we can be better. It’s human nature. Genius is knowing
when to stop.

Of course, friends are unlikely to criticize, but my friends are jerks
so they would never hesitate to tell me I suck. Their suggestions,
therefore, meant a lot. They tell me I have a good thing going and I
should make some effort to promote myself and monetize my act. They had
suggestions on both fronts. I’m not comfortable with either of those
things, but maybe I’m wrong about it. I thought this podcast would be a
fun gag, but I’d stink at it and get bored. I’m getting better and I’m
enjoying it. Still, I need to mull it over.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
