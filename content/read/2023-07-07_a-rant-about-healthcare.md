As I race toward decrepitude, my interaction with the healthcare system
will increase, thus raising my awareness of its many faults. At this
point, I am lucky to only have to see the doctor once a year for a
physical. I have had occasional injuries in the past, but none of those
required more than a single visit. Even so, the lunacy of the healthcare
system is obvious even at this stage of my life.

The thing about the system is that it works to the interest of everyone
except the patients, but we insist on calling it private healthcare.
There is nothing private about it as every aspect is controlled by
corporate interests, which both advance and direct government interests
in the system. If you want to understand fascist economics, spend some
time in the American healthcare system.

Something I did not mention in the show is that a sizable chunk of what
passes for healthcare is either unnecessary or not healthcare. The
legions of bureaucrats and functionaries that serve only the interest of
the system are a great example of Pournelle’s iron law of bureaucracy.
The system is an upside-down pyramid with the doctors and nurses at the
bottom.

It is hard to see how this system survives the great wave of baby boomer
retirement and the wave of demographic change. A highly complex system
operated by low-IQ people is doomed due to that mismatch, but throw in
the tens of millions of old people demanding services and collapse is
the only possible outcome. The Covid response was a glimpse of how bad
things will get in the next decade.
