Has the world gone mad? It certainly seems that way to some of us. Even
the most cynical never imagined the government shutting down the country
for fear of a virus, but it has suddenly become the new normal. The
cynical, if they thought of it at all, would have thought the opposite.
Instead of a great lock down, the response would have been for the
beautiful people to insulate themselves from harm, while abandoning the
rest of us to the plague. Instead, we have all gone mad together.

Not everyone has got the fever, that is this panic fever, not the one
caused by the Chinese coronavirus. Our world is now firmly divided into
two camps. There are those fully invested in the great panic over the
virus and there are those who look at the other camp, gobsmacked by what
appears to be a general madness. Those in panic look at the rest of us
the same way preppers look at normal people. They just assume the gods
will strike us down for doubting the virus

Of course, the people in the skeptic camp could be the ones suffering
from some form of madness that prevents them from seeing the threat. The
trouble is, the great plague is not exactly lighting up the scoreboard.
America has tested over 600,000 people suspected of having the virus.
Over 500,000 tested negative. Of the positives, 12,000 needed hospital
care. In a country of over 320 million people with 200,000 empty
hospital beds at any one time, that’s not much of a crisis.

Yet, despite the numbers, formerly sober-minded people continue to carry
on as if there are bodies in the streets. Steve Sailer, a man not known
for excitability, is calling this virus <a
href="https://www.unz.com/isteve/how-long-to-shut-down-lets-procrastinate-on-making-that-decision/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a great adversary</a> of the
human race. Greg Cochran has completely lost his marbles over this
thing. Geneticist and HBD enthusiast
<a href="https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/1243624237933289472"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Razib Khan</a> is in hiding,
convinced the end times are upon us. In fact, the whole HBD community is
a click away from fleeing to Antarctica to wait out the end of
civilization.

Of course, part of the panic, a symptom of that particular virus, is a
set of abracadabra phrases that have become so common they seem like
something from a secret society, understood only by the initiates. The
<a href="https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/1242535319569723392"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">duller sorts</a> chant about
“exponential growth” while others talk about “the hospitals being
overwhelmed.” That’s why we have to “flatten the curve” and “slow the
spread.” These incantations are to chase away doubt and reinforce the
belief that people are dying in the streets.

The dying in the streets bit is not much of an exaggeration. A popular
bit of folklore now among the panicked is some version of the anonymous
ER doctor or nurse relaying how they are overwhelmed and letting people
die in the hallways. This urban legend turned up in China, Washington,
Italy, New York and now
<a href="https://chicagoboyz.net/archives/62251.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Orleans</a>. Formerly
sensible people now pass these whoppers around on-line, never bothering
to think that maybe they are being fed a just-so story by people seeking
attention.

One emerging aspect to the madness is the moral dimension. The HBD crowd
seems to have been hardest hit. They spend a lot of time contemplating
nature and their fellow man’s refusal to respect it. Part of what is
driving them now is a sense that nature is going to finally exact some
revenge. In other words, this panic is part of a strange revenge
fantasy, where they are finally vindicated by biological reality. This
sudden sense of moral purpose has made them immune to reason.

Another aspect to this general panic, unrelated to the virus itself, is
a different type of revenge fantasy. Many people are cheering the
collapse of the economy and civil life on the mistaken belief that what
emerges from the rubble will have
<a href="https://twitter.com/ramzpaul/status/1243026350392446977"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">them</a> at the top of the
social hierarchy. This is a phenomenon shared across the political
spectrum. It seems to be most popular with young people unhappy with the
status quo and far too caught up in purge fantasies to be reached with
facts and reason.

Probably the most salient aspect to this panic is the role of women. As
has been noted too many times to count, the West is now a gynocracy. It
is not a matriarchy, as women have stopped bearing children and stopped
caring about children. Look around and you see childless women in
positions of authority all over the West. In fact, these are women who
reached their status by rejecting every aspect of womanhood. The West is
now a world run by middle-aged childless women.

Anyone who has been around women in a crisis has observed a strange
phenomenon among childless adult females. Some switch gets flipped in a
crisis where their protective instincts get misdirected at the adults in
the room. This part of their nature was never allowed to mature in the
raising of children, so it comes bursting forth in an incoherent desire
to help when their help is not needed. They become like mother ducks
loudly herding the brood to safety.

For a society run by such women, every crisis is met with demands that
everyone shelter in place. Notice how over the last few decades that
public officials no longer call for volunteers or tell people to pitch
in and work together. Such independent action violates the frightened
female’s sense of duty to her brood. Instead, mild weather events now
close the schools and force people to work from home. This virus scare
is every middle-aged women’s Hunger Games moment.

Mass panics are a known phenomenon. The general panic that took place in
France between July 22 and August 6 1789 is known as The Great Fear. It
was a period of rural unrest, driven by both a grain shortage and rumors
of an aristocrats’ “famine plot” to starve the peasants. The exact
reason for this panic is in dispute.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergotism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ergotism</a> is a favorite
reason for those with a certain sense of humor, but most historians
consider it one of the primary causes of the French Revolution.

At some point, the bloom comes off this lock-down rose once people start
to feel the real cost of listening to madmen. People will remember that
the same folks who swore Boris and Natasha had used their mind control
devise to install Trump in the White House are the many of the same
people peddling this panic. Necessity will force a lot of people to stop
going along with what they have suspected from the start is nothing more
than a mass panic. Soon, this all comes to an end.

Like the Great Fear, the Great Madness will leave a mark, or at least it
should leave a mark on our society. You never can be sure about these
things, as the West seems to be unusually immune to learning from these
events. Two centuries ago The Great Fear meant the end of the feudal
order and eventually a revolution. It was not the sole cause of the
revolution, maybe not the main cause. It was certainly an example of how
the old order was no longer able to maintain order.

It is too soon to know what this panic means for us. Perhaps it further
undermines the legitimacy of the system and the people that profit from
it. Perhaps it sets off social changes that slowly transform our society
in ways we have yet to imagine. Maybe the fever breaks and this event,
like the Russian hoax, gets forgotten. Given what most likely awaits on
the other side of the lock-down, it is hard to imagine this great
madness being forgotten. There’s always a price to be paid for following
madmen.
