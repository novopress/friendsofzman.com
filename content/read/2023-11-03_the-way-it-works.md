The selection of a complete nobody to be the Speaker of the House is a
good way to understand how things actually work in our system. Most
people still think their vote matters in terms of who occupies elected
office and how they go about their jobs, but the rise of Mike Johnson
shows that to be false. You voting has little bearing on the way the
pollical system functions.

Look at Johnson’s career and you see how the system selects for and
against types of people at the lowest levels of politics. If one day you
want to be in Congress, it means starting in politics at a young age and
subjecting yourself to a lengthy filtering process to make sure you are
going to fit and support the system. Our democracy selects for
conformity and strongly selects against curiosity.

This also explains why the political class has such a strong contempt
for the people the system is supposed to represent. As a practical
matter, only about ten percent of elected officials are subject to the
voters. The rest occupy safe seats that are controlled by the party.
That means your success as an office holder depends on making the party
and its underwriters happy. The voters are an annoying distraction.

Elected officials and the vast army of supporting players feel compelled
to play along with the charade of democracy, but at some level even the
dullest of the bunch understand it is all a pointless performance. It is
that conflict between the reality of politics and the need to pretend
otherwise that leads to frustration. If the voters would just agree with
everything, life would be so simple in Washington.

That is why a guy like Mike Johnson gets selected. So far, he has
demonstrated an ability to convince the rubes back home that the system
works. He also brings the multi-billion-dollar Christian Inc. operation
with him, which will make sure to bribe any potential detractors in the
caucus. That way the system can go back to doing what it is designed to
do, which is to serve the interests of the <a
