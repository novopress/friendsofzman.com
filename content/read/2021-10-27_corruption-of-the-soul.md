One way to measure the health of a society is to look at how the ruling
elite of that society protects the things that are important to the
society. Just as the management of a company cannot micromanage every
aspect of the firm, the ruling class cannot make sure every rule and
custom is strictly enforced. It has to focus its energy on the big items
that make the society possible. From there this attitude will flow down
to the lower levels who will enforce the smaller rules.

What the ruling elite of a society does by enforcing the big rules,
especially those that manage the affairs of the ruling class, is set the
tone. A disciplined ruling class reinforces the idea that the rules
matter, and they must be respected. This attitude becomes a habit of
mind for the people. On the other hand, a ruling class that has no
respect for its own rules helps foster a culture of cheating. If it is
okay for the bosses to cheat, then only a sucker follows the rules.

The easy example of this is the Roman Republic. When the families at the
top of the social order strictly abided by the rules that governed
patricians, the plebeians followed their lead in the minor things. The
republican virtue that was necessary for their society was a habit of
mind. Once the people at the top stopped enforcing their rules, the rest
of the culture followed. Caesar was simply the logical end point of a
process of decay that began long before he crossed the Rubicon.

In this age, things like the rule of law, the orderly transition of
power and the respect for rational inquiry are the big items of society.
Liberal democracies are supposed to be rule-based societies that seek to
progress by advances in knowledge. That is done by allowing people to
investigate the natural world looking for better solutions to the
problems of life. These investigations are to follow a set of rules and
ethics that reflect the general morality. Progress is orderly and open.

Recent events make plain that the rule of law has broken down across all
levels of American society. The rich always have advantages in the law,
but now they operate under a different set of rules entirely. America is
now ruled by a pirate class that is free to do what they like to the
people. Similarly, the orderly transition of power through the mechanism
of elections has become a farce. No one involved has any respect for the
rules of democracy and no one can trust the results.

Those seem like things that could be fixed once the geezers at the top
of the political system are replaced by a new class of people. There is
no guarantee, and the odds are not great, but it seems to most people
that there is some hope of fixing these problems through a renewal of
the liberal democratic spirit. On the other hand, the respect for
rational inquiry and debate appears to be hopelessly lost. We are
rapidly reaching a point where dissent is explicitly forbidden in
America.

That in itself could be lumped in with the other bits of the system that
need reform, but the corruption has gone beyond suppression. It is
becoming clear that the culture of mendacity that plagues the political
class has become the norm within the realms of science and medicine. A
culture of rule breaking at the top of society has fostered a culture of
dishonestly within the academic community. Even in the hard sciences the
willingness to cheat and lie has become quite common.

A good recent example is the Elizabeth Holmes <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">trial</a>. Everything about her career
and the company she created was a fraud. This was plainly obvious to
many, but they remained quiet as there is no reward for enforcing the
rules. Breaking the rules can make you very rich, so lots of people
break the rules. The fact that the state is struggling to put this woman
in a cage speaks to the legal corruption. The fact that she exists
speaks to the corruption in the academy.

She is not alone. The chief executive of biotech firm Athira Pharma was
<a
href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/21/athira-chief-executive-resigns-as-company-confirms-she-altered-research/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">forced out</a> of her position when she
admitted to faking her research. When she was a graduate student, she
falsified her findings in a number of studies. Those studies set her up
for funding to start the company. They were also used to obtain patents.
Despite the fact she is a fraud and her company a sham, she only had to
resign, and the company will continue on as if nothing important
happened.

The elephant in the room on this topic is Covid. The idea of science has
been so corrupted that it is now warping the language. Because the <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/health/pfizer-vaccine-waning-immunity/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">vaccines</a> do not actually work as
promised, the language is being changed to fit the crime. It used to be
that vaccines provided immunity from infection by a specific virus. Now
immunity means a sense of happiness that comes from compliance. You may
still die from Covid, or you could become <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/health/covid-vaccines-death-rates/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">immortal</a>. Who can tell anymore?

Science and its practical application have been the gift from the gods
that has allowed man to move beyond his primitive existence. In modern
societies it is the thing that is supposed to provide the limits on
excess and steadily improve daily life. It is fair to say that trust in
scientific and technological progress is the bedrock of modernity. It is
the thing that we all trust to keep society anchored to reality. It
should be the thing the ruling class protects at all costs, but that is
no longer true.

In a world where you cannot trust the important things, the little
things become nothing but a matter of opinion or convenience. If the
people at the top have no respect for the rule of law, then the people
at the bottom will have no reason to follow the law other than fear of
punishment. The culture will become one where evading the spirit of the
rules is the natural habit of mind. This corruption of the soul of
society will corrupt the soul of the people, as we are witnessing today.
