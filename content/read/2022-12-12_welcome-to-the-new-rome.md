It is a first person account of the events by a couple of good guys who
deserve your support. it would be a great Christmas gift.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you agree to play a game with someone and the first rule of the
game is that your opponent sets the rules of the game and he can change
the rules whenever he likes for any reason he likes. That would mean
that no matter your mastery of the rules, you must always lose the game
because your opponent will simply change the rules whenever necessary.
You would spend all of your time learning rules that keep changing to
put you at a disadvantage.

Similarly, imagine that you decide to build a house on another man’s
property, without getting a fixed agreement on your use rights. Since
the landowner could at any time tell you to remove your house or even
deny you access to it, the focus of your life must be making sure that
you are in good standing with the landowner. While technically the house
is yours, in reality he sets the rules for how you use it. Like the game
example above, your life is about complying with changing rules.

This is the situation for professional Christians. They have agreed to
allow their opponents to set the rules of the moral framework. Like the
guy building a house on another man’s land, they have built their church
on progressive land. The professional Christian must always get
permission to use his church. Or like the game example, he must spend
his time making sure the tenets of his faith comport with the changing
morality of the prevailing the moral framework.

You see it in this rather bizarre <a
href="https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2022/12/identity-politics-on-the-right"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> at *First Things*. There are two
main assertions made in the post. One is that racism, and the
mythological concept of white supremacy, are the worst things possible.
The other point is that it is the duty of Christians to purge those
accused of these sins from the ranks of the political Right. To make
this point, he piles on a guy named Thomas Achord, a headmaster of a
private classical Christian academy, who was accused of blasphemy by the
Left.

A feature of professional Christianity is to not only abandon a fellow
Christian attacked by the enemies of the faith, but to also rush to the
front of the line of bigots taking turns kicking the accused. <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/thomas-achord-confesses/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the execrable Rod Dreher
taking some self-righteous shots at Thomas Achord. Like David French,
Rod Dreher never misses an opportunity to promote his own virtue. He is
who Emerson had in mind when he said, “The more he spoke of his virtue,
the faster we counted the spoons.”

Note that Christian mercy never comes up when the Left starts howling
for the blood of a Christian accused of violating the progressive faith.
Professional Christians are like a pack of wild dogs. As soon as they
sense a member of the pack is weak, they pounce on the poor fellow,
tearing him to pieces. One cannot help but wonder if this behavior is
solely to please the Left. Many of them, like Dreher and French, seem to
take pleasure in these sadistic rituals.

Of course, the reason that professional Christians rush out these
condemnations whenever one of their own has violated progressive dogma
is to let the people holding the other end of the leash know they are a
good boy. For professional Christians, what matters is remaining in good
standing with the Left. These ritualized condemnations are a public act
of piety – progressive piety. It is an affirmation that Christian piety
must always rest on the moral foundations of the Left.

Another example of this sort vulgarity is this self-published
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQmKCl27IwM" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">video</a> from Anglican priest in Nova Scotia Canada. If
not for the collar, one would be forgiven for thinking Father Ed Trevors
is a weirdo from the grievance studies department. In the description of
this tantrum, he makes sure to post his pronouns. One thing missing from
his public act of piety is a reference to Scripture. Like all Anglican
priests, he is probably unfamiliar with the foundation text of his
church.

Putting aside the vulgarity of these displays, the premise of the
argument in that *First Things* article is anything but a Christian
argument. Jesus Christ had plenty of chances to state his opinions about
racism and white supremacy. He had nothing to say on the matter. His
disciples wrote and spoke about the full range of the human dilemma but
never bothered to mention anything about racism. Scripture is silent on
the issue of race and the moral claims around it.

The reason for this is that these are entirely novel concepts conjured
in the last century for purely political reasons. Even those on the
winning side of the American Civil War lacked the racism concept.
Lincoln famously said, “there is a physical difference between the white
and black races that will for ever forbid the two races from living
together on terms of social and political equality.” He repeated these
claims throughout the Civil War to audiences on his side.

Now, there are people who will cherry pick lines from Scripture claiming
that Jesus was very much opposed to racism. Never mind that the concept
did not exist in the age of Jesus and his language lacked words for the
concept. Even if one can make these leaps of logic, the reason for doing
so is to make Christian morality match progressive morality, in order to
please the people controlling public morality. Those who bothered to
read their Bible should be thinking of Matthew 6:24 right now.

In fairness, the professional Christian can argue that Christians must
live in this world and that means navigating around secular moral
claims. That is clearly not what we are seeing with these people.
Instead, their Christianity is just part of the sales pitch they use to
convince Christian people to embrace secular morality. Once you accept
this new class of sins as far worse than those in your theology, you
have subordinated your theology to those creating the new class of sins.

Arguably the most challenging thing is this age is to be a Christian.
Your enemies control the commanding heights of Western society. Your
friends are always looking for a way to profit from their alleged
defense of you. It is a good reminder that all moral frameworks must
stand alone. In the case of Christianity, it means the logic of the
faith must stand outside of and often opposed to the prevailing
orthodoxy. Christianity now finds itself where it started. Welcome to
the new Rome.
