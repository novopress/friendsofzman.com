Over the last decade the usual suspects have directed a great deal of
resources into anathematizing the term “Christian Nationalism.” One
reason is the long war against Christianity in general that dates to the
start of the last century. Since these people assume nationalism is a
bad word, whatever they can attach it to becomes bad as a result of the
linkage. This sort of linguistic guilt by association has been a popular
tactic with the usual suspects for a long time.

Another attack is from the establishment churches and affiliated
political operations, who worry that their people are getting wise to
the grift. Like conservatism in general, social conservatism has been a
massive failure. Since so-called Christian organizations have been at
the forefront of the culture war, the rank and file are now looking
around for an alternative way forward. The people who got rich off
losing the culture war see Christian nationalism as a threat to their
grift.

The idea behind Christian Nationalism is to provide an alternative moral
authority that is in direct contradiction of the one used by the ruling
class. No one talks about the moral authority of the ruling elite,
especially the ruling elite, but it is assumed that they have some
reason for promoting things like diversity and the sexual fads. Maybe it
all boils down to bourgeois spite or maybe they think the cause of
justice requires them to annihilate society, but whatever the authority,
Christian Nationalists reject it.

That is where things get complicated. Within the Christian Nationalist
subculture, you see Catholics and Protestants, which raises an obvious
issue. You also see many within this space migrating to Eastern
Orthodoxy. The reason for the latter is the people in the former are
disgusted by the direction of their churches. Of course, you also have
the churchless who rely only on their reading of Scripture. They tend to
be the most vocal in the public square about their political intensions.

Putting aside the theological differences that exist within this
subculture, the bigger question is how to square the Christian with the
nationalism. The one thing all of these people would agree upon is
Christ died for all mankind, so all men, regardless of race or
ethnicity, can accept Jesus Christ and thus become a Christian. If your
church is open to everyone, then it stands to reasons that your
community is open to everyone, which contradicts the logic of
nationalism.

This is where we bump into the elephant in the room. The big exception
to the open-door policy is non-Christians. This is where the usual
suspects come back into the story, as they claim Christianity is just a
fig leaf for the nationalism. When they hiss the word “nationalism” they
mean “fascism”, of course. In fairness to the usual suspects, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Identity"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Christian Identity Movement</a> was
exactly this approach. Many of the most vocal Christian Nationalists
today are hostile to Jews.

This is especially dangerous from the point of view of the usual
suspects because this line of reasoning applies to the very idea of
nations. If you want a nation, one with a single language, culture, and
people, then you are seeking an *exclusive* society, rather than an open
one. Just as a Christian society must be intolerant of non-Christians, a
nationalist society must be intolerant of minorities. Otherwise, you
open the foundations of society up to challenges from those minorities.

This brings us back to the eternal question. For Jews to maximize their
opportunities in a society, it must not be exclusive of them or their
activity. This is the Karl Popper – George Soros argument for the open
society. The moral foundation must not be exclusive in any way, which
eliminates both nationalism and Christianity from the moral foundation
of the open society. Obviously, this logic benefits all minorities, not
just Jews, but it also comes at the expense of the majority.

The logic of Christian nationalism puts them at odds with the bulk of
modern Christians who are no longer Christian in the theological sense.
Most are Judeo-Christian, a weird modern phenomenon that defines
Christianity in terms of Israel. It is not unusual for ads like
<a href="https://youtu.be/UDM1h-gdGUY?si=mOT7Td61sRz9kznF"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this one</a> to appear on platforms that
cater to modern Christians. Much of what modern Christians <a
href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/03/11/christians-united-for-israel-raises-2-5m-to-bring-ukrainian-jews-to-safety/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">do</a> is undisguisable from Zionism.
That presents and an obvious problem for the people promoting Christian
Nationalism.

That brings us back to the theological issue. The Christian Nationalists
have a problem in that they think they must operate within the tradition
of Christianity. That does not leave them a lot of room to operate. Even
those who think Scripture is the only source of truth are faced with the
fact that Scripture is a man-made thing. There are lots of lost and
excluded
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Books_of_the_Bible_and_the_Forgotten_Books_of_Eden)
of the Bible. Someone decided to exclude things from Scripture, maybe
even things lost to us entirely.

By accepting the framing of the past, they are limiting what they can do
as both Christian and nationalists. There is no getting around the fact
that the arc of Christianity has led to this point. The universalism is
one problem, but the inherent individualism is another big challenge. if
all men have an individual relationship with God and are judges as
individuals, there is not much room for collective virtue. The virtue of
the community will always came second to individual virtue.

What the Christian Nationalists face is a bigger task than reasserting
or defending the idea of a Christian nation. They first need to
revolutionize both terms. Their Christianity needs to break free of the
traditional framing in order to avoid being trapped in a mode of thought
that precludes nationalism. At the same time, they have to rethink the
idea of nationalism so that it comports with and promotes the compassion
that must lie at the heart of their new Christianity.

That sounds like an impossible task, especially given the makeup of the
Christian nationalist subculture. These are people with homes and
families, hardly the sort to overthrow the current order. On the other
hand, Christianity was a revolutionary movement from the start.
Nationalism, despite what the usual suspects claim, has also been a
revolutionary cause. In other words, the Christian Nationalists are
working with material that has always been dangerous to the status quo.

What makes it possible for them to think in these terms is the fact that
the old forms are no longer working. The old regime is in crisis because
the old systems and old moral claims are no longer working. The last
time a world bestriding empire fell into crisis it gave birth to a new
religious movement that eventually swept the world. Whether or not there
is a theologian or even a charismatic leader ready to accept the
challenge is unknown, but the ground is fertile for such a thing.
