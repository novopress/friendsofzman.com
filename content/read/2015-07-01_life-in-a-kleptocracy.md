It’s tempting to think the lawlessness we are seeing with our government
is a new development, but it has been a slow incremental process. Heck,
you can go back to the the 70’s and fine court ruling that were plucked
out of thin air. Roe is the most obvious example. The court held that if
the Founders had thought of it, they would have included abortion in the
Bill of Rights so we’ll just pretend they did.

Most of the lawlessness in America is a much more mundane thing like <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">the abuse of civil forfeiture laws</a>.

*In February 2014, Drug Enforcement Administration task force
officers at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport
<a href="http://ij.org/r/kentucky-forfeiture/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">seized $11,000 in cash from 24-year-old college student
Charles Clarke</a>. They didn’t find any guns, drugs or contraband on
him. But, according to <a
href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/06/affidavit.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">an affidavit</a> filled out by one of the
agents, the task force officers reasoned that the cash was the proceeds
of drug trafficking, because Clarke was traveling on a
recently-purchased one-way ticket, he was unable to provide
documentation for where the money came from, and his checked baggage had
an odor of marijuana. (He was a marijuana smoker.)*

*Clarke’s cash, which says he he spent five years saving up, was seized
under civil asset forfeiture, where cops are able to take cash and
property from people who are never convicted of — and in some cases,
never even charged with — a crime. The DEA
<a href="http://www.dea.gov/ops/af.shtml" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">maintains</a> that asset forfeiture is an important
crime-fighting tool: “By attacking the financial infrastructure of drug
trafficking organizations world-wide, DEA has disrupted and dismantled
major drug trafficking organizations and their supply chains, thereby
improving national security and increasing the quality of life for the
American public.”*

*But the practice has become contentious, in part because agencies are
generally allowed to keep a share of the cash and property they
seize. In cases like Clarke’s, where local and federal agents cooperate
on a seizure, federal agencies typically keep at least 20 percent of the
assets, while local cops <a
href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ri/legacy/2012/03/26/esguidelines.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">split the remainder among themselves</a>.
Critics argue that this creates a profit motive and leads to “<a
href="http://www.cato.org/events/policing-profit-abuse-civil-asset-forfeiture"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">policing for profit</a>.”*

There’s a term for this. It’s called piracy. In the age of sail, the
crown would unleash privateers on the shipping of another country. One
king’s pirates were another king’s entrepreneurs. Today, the privateers
get a W2 from the local government and rob the subjects of the crown.

This being 2015 America there’s a non-trivial chance this story is
entirely made up or they left out important facts. Sadly, we simply
cannot trust our news sites these days. Still, I know of too many
similar cases. The pattern is they target people they think are unlikely
to lawyer up and take them to federal court. If you’re a lawyer at a
white shoe firm you can travel through these jurisdictions carrying bags
of cash. The state always targets the weak.
