**Note:** Today at 1:00 PM EDT I will be on with Paul Ramsey. It is only
on <a href="https://rumble.com/c/RAMZPAUL" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Rumble</a> as I am a very bad man, so YouTube prohibits
me. Yesterday I did a chat with Mike Farris which will be posted
<a href="http://coffeeandamike.com/podcasts/" rel="noopener"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nathan Cofnas is a college faculty member at Cambridge University who
became a minor celebrity as a college student for engaging in a round of
<a href="https://nathancofnas.com/debate-with-kevin-macdonald/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">debates</a> with Kevin MacDonald about
MacDonald’s
<a href="http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/books.htm#Books" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">books</a> on Jews. His primary purpose was to gain
attention for himself, but his secondary purpose was to dismiss
MacDonald’s theory of group evolution strategy to explain Jewish
behavior. Cofnas has now returned to the subject with another
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-022-00352-x"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> disputing MacDonald’s theory.

His latest effort is neatly summarized in the abstract of the paper. “I
conclude that, contra the anti-Jewish narrative, Jews are not
particularly ethnocentric, Jewish intellectuals do not typically
advocate liberal multiculturalism for gentiles but not for Jews, Jews
did not orchestrate the rise of liberalism or blank-slatism in the West,
and anti-Semitism is not primarily a response to actual Jewish
wrongdoing.” It would take a heart of stone not to chuckle a bit at
that.

What you see from Cofnas in his latest effort is what we saw from the
very beginning, which is sophistry decorated with the trappings of the
academy. In fairness, most of what comes from the humanities and the
pseudo-sciences is sophistry decorated with the trappings of the
academy, but Cofnas avoids the insider language and abracadabra phrases
common in the modern academy. That makes the sophistry the star of the
show, rather than a supporting actor.

The biggest sin is his insistence that his premise is the default
hypothesis simply because it suits his argument. He claims that the most
logical explanation for Jewish overrepresentation in various fields is
intelligence and geography. Jews are smart and they tend to live in
urban areas. Therefore, they tend to be overrepresented in cognitive
fields because these fields tend to operate in urban areas where Jews
are overrepresented relative to the general population.

That is intellectual base stealing. He assert a premise without proof
and then he declares it the default hypothesis. That said, he is not
wrong in claiming that Jewish IQ is a key factor. Contra most of the
fans of MacDonald’s work, but not MacDonald himself, Jews are an IQ
outlier. While they are suffering from the same decline effecting all of
humanity, Jews remain at the top of the IQ pyramid, and this helps
explain their overrepresentation in cognitive fields.

The trouble is, and Cofnas understands this, it does not explain
everything. In purely cognitive fields in which no other factors play a
role, Jews should be twenty percent of the people in the field, despite
being two percent of the population. Twenty years ago the anonymous
academic posting under the name La Griffe du Lion
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/ashkenaz.htm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">modeled</a> this using chess championships in the former
Soviet Union. His model corresponds with the arguments from psychometry
regarding Ashkenazi intelligence.

The problem, however, is that Jews are wildly overrepresented in fields
that are not cognitively challenging, but culturally important. Unless
someone wants to argue that the mass media or pornography are
cognitively challenging fields, there is something else driving Jewish
overrepresentation in these fields. Geography helped a little in the
case of mass media fifty years ago, but not in this age. That and the
over representation is quite outlandish in some fields.

Within living memory, the answer was ethnocentrism. Into the 1980’s it
was common for Jews and non-Jews to quip that Jews stick together.
Jewish comedians had a field of humor around the question, “is it good
for the Jews?” It used to be understood that minority populations stick
together. In fact, this was part of the melting pot theory of
Americanism for half a century. Jewish ethnocentrism goes a long way
toward completing the picture on Jewish overrepresentation.

Cofnas rejects this out of hand, and it is not hard to see why. If he
concedes this point, then it opens the door a bit for MacDonald. When
you boil it down, MacDonald’s theory of group evolutionary strategy is
the claim that Jews evolved a model of reality that has allowed them to
thrive as a distinct minority, often in the midst of a host population
that is hostile to Jews. In order for this to occur, Jews would have had
to develop a high degree of ethnocentrism to resist assimilation.

The second order effects of this model of reality are things like
overrepresentation in activities disruptive to the majority. If who you
are is dependent upon your membership in a group and that group’s
identity depends upon an adversarial relationship with the surrounding
populations, members will gravitate to those things that benefit the
group and undermines the power of those other populations. Anyone who
has followed a sports team will recognize this impulse.

That is why Cofnas must reject ethnocentrism, even though it is
blazingly obvious to anyone paying attention. There is nothing unusual
about ethnic groups sticking together in America nor is there anything
immoral about it. Modern Wokism is just group identity applied to
artificially constructed identity groups. Cofnas, however, must
anathematize ethnocentrism, as it provides a building block for
MacDonald’s theory of group evolutionary strategy.

The weakness of the Cofnas argument does not automatically validate
MacDonald’s theory of group evolutionary strategy. The best argument
Cofnas makes in this long back and forth is that the theory lacks
empirical support. At best, MacDonald provides a useful model for Jewish
group behavior, but he offers nothing with regards to the biological
mechanism at work here. If Jews evolved to be this way, then how exactly
does that work from a genetic perspective?

That is the real problem with MacDonald’s theory. Evolutionary biology
is gene-centered, so something like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">group selection</a> gets little support. In other words,
MacDonald’s theory is at odds with current science. More importantly, it
is at odds with the current dogma within the human sciences. In this
regard, MacDonald has company, as those suggesting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-level selection</a> may help fill
in the gaps are facing the same headwinds as MacDonald.

Max Planck famously said, “Science advances one funeral at a time” and
that is what will most likely happen with regards to group behavior.
Observation tells us that groups have innate behaviors. Biology tells us
that if such a thing exists, it must be gene specific and subject to
selection pressure. The people controlling the flow of grant money to
the human sciences tell us that talking about group behavior is
dangerous and best avoided, so we wait for the next round of funerals.

That may be the biggest error in MacDonald’s work. He had to know he was
treading on dangerous ground with this topic. His use of the word
“strategy” to describe his theory may be technically accurate, but it
conjures the wrong ideas in the wrong heads, which is the real issue
here. The anti-Semites hear “strategy” and imagine men in secret,
plotting their demise, while the anti-anti-Semites hear the word
“strategy” and imagine the first set of men in secret, plotting their
demise.

Scientist such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sloan_Wilson"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Sloan Wilson</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Sober" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Elliott Sober</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">E. O. Wilson</a> have been able to research and discuss
this material by avoiding trigger words. If you are going to talk about
group behavior and you suspect certain groups with power would like to
avoid talking about group behavior, it is prudent to avoid the sort of
language they associate with threats to their group power. We like to
believe that the truth will set you free, but it is just as likely to
get you hurled into the void.

In the end, the participants in this debate are in the realm of
model-dependent reality, even though they do not realize it. The Cofnas
model of reality is useful to him personally, but also useful to his
supporters in the academy. It solves the sorts of problems they
encounter. The MacDonald model of reality is different, but not
contradictory to the Cofnas reality. In fact, there is overlap between
the two and that is where model independent reality lies.
