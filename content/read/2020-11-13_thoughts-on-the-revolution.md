Sometimes it is good to take a pause from the action to reflect upon
what has happened and how things have changed. Life is like being a bit
of flotsam on a river, carried to some unknown destination. We all know
that at some point we reach the big waterfall at the end, but the
journey along the way is not so clear. Unlike the flotsam, we can create
our own slow part of the river in order to rest and enjoy the view.

Ten years is not a long time in the life of a man. The older you get the
more you appreciate this reality. Ten years ago, Barak Obama was the
president and the ugly, brutish masses had just sent a message in the
midterm election. The misty-eyed drunkard, John Boehner, was about to
become Speaker of the House and the Tea Party movement was promising a
bourgeois revolution from the top.

That seems like a lifetime ago. I doubt anyone would have predicted that
we would be at this point, facing a world in which most of the country
thinks our elections are rigged and we are headed for civil war. There
were people way back then who thought we were headed for a civil war,
but they thought it was a bad thing. Today, you get the sense that most
people would welcome the final battle to settle things.

The French New Right theorist, Guillaume Fay, introduced the idea of an
interregnum, an undefined period between the old age of the West and the
new age. In this undefined and unsettled period, the West would lurch
from crisis to crisis. The old order would rally to address the crisis,
but not completely. Eventually, the natural order of man would prevail
and a new order would emerge.

That is what we are facing now. It is clear that there is no return to
the civic nationalist fantasy times of the 80’s and 90’s. Too much
damage has been done to the institutions for such a return to be
possible. That and the demographics would have to be fixed first and
that’s not happening without a rebellion. There’s also the fact that
people seem to be figuring this out and may no longer want to go back.

We live in the most interesting time any of us have seen. In the first
phase of the cultural revolution in the middle of the last century, the
institutions were strong enough to weather the assault. They were simply
repurposed by the Left. In this phase, the institutions are too weak.
Increasingly, the question on people’s minds will not be “how do we save
them?”, but “how to we replace them?”

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
