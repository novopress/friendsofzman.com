It is a new year and it is important to start with a clean slate, so
this is an unscheduled show to clear out the mail bag. That way I can
close out 2022 without any unfinished business and start the new year
without a hangover from the prior year. I also felt guilty about letting
the mail bag linger and not acknowledging the people who sent gifts to
me since the last time I did one of these shows.

The intro to the show is Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians. When I
was a kid he was on television ringing in the new year. His version of
“Auld Lang Syne” was the only version as far as anyone knew. Out of
curiosity I looked around to see if anyone had tried to do an updated
version of it. The results were not good. Allegedly this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aop6YF1Xqqg" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Mariah Carey version</a> is considered the best new
version. It is terrible.

There are some songs that should never be sung by anyone but the person
who made the song famous. The Sid Vicious version of “My Way” is amusing
and it has meaning in terms of music history, but it is terrible
otherwise. The only version worth hearing is the Sinatra version. A
modern singer performing the song is suggesting she belongs on the same
stage as Sinatra.

My guess is they have trashed up the New Year’s eve shows to the point
where only a degenerate can tolerate them. I have not stayed up to watch
any of them in decades, so I am left to guess. I think the last time I
made it to midnight on the big night was in the 1980’s, but I no longer
remember. My tradition is to be asleep before the clock strikes midnight
so I can get an early start on the year.

Happy New Year!
