**Notes:** The Monday Taki
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/biden-declares-war/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is up. This week is a late take
on the Biden speech from Hell that is getting the memory hole treatment.
Sunday Thoughts is on holiday, but there are new posts behind the green
door. <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog" rel="noopener"

There are a lot of ways people on this side of the great divide describe
the difference between one side and the other. The term “red pill”,
borrowed from the Matrix movies, is the most popular term, but it has
lost much of it meaning. People will talk about their awakening, but the
term “woke” is now owned by the crazies and therefore indicates mental
illness rather than political awareness. Another popular term is “based”
but like “red pill” it has been overused.

These terms generally focus on the race issue, which is more accurately
stated as the biology issue or biological realism. The main bridge over
the great divide is the acceptance of biological reality with regards to
sex, ethnicity and race. People on this side of the great divide accept
reality, with regards to the human condition, as it appears and reject
the various social constructs of the orthodoxy. This makes sense as it
is the most obvious and easiest to grasp.

There is another aspect to the phenomenon of waking up to the reality of
the world and choosing to live in the truth. That is the nature of
modern society. It takes a while, but people who make the journey to
this side of the divide eventually come to figure out that the biology
issue is the leaves of the tree. The root of the tree is the vast
managerial system that allows a tiny minority to wield power. We do not
live in a liberal democracy, but rather in a large imperial corporate
state.

A useful example to illustrate the point is this long
<a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/why-are-we-in-ukraine/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in the Claremont Review of Books
by Christopher Caldwell. As John Derbyshire has pointed out, Caldwell is
a skillful social critic who has a knack for making important insights
in such a way that the average reader can grasp them. He is a man who
lives within the system even though he is a critic of the system. Unlike
most mainstream pundits, he does not spend his days signaling against
the people on this side of the divide.

Therein lies the important bit. Despite his ability and willingness to
critically analyze the system in which he lives, he remains a man of the
system. He is on that side of the great divide, not this one. The tell
is the default position. Christopher Caldwell assumes his compatriots
are mostly working from good intentions and mostly trying to get things
right, even if most are highly partisan. Therefore, he can trust their
depiction of events in the Ukraine and build his analysis accordingly.

In the second paragraph, he states, “Since June, thousands of
computer-guided artillery rockets have been wreaking havoc behind
Russian lines.” People on this side of the great divide who have
bothered to follow the war will see this as material placed in the Post
and Times by military contractors. The so-called “wonder weapon”
narrative has been a running joke among those relying on more
trustworthy sources. Even the Ukrainians have started to mock this
claim.

Right after the wonder weapon narrative, is the narrative that claims
Russia is a gas station run by peasants. “With western European help,
Washington has used its control of the choke points of the global
marketplace to impoverish Russians, in hopes of punishing Russia.” The
sanctions regime has made the world poorer and the Russians have not
been spared, but it has been an inconvenience. The claims from the Post
and Times about the Russian economy are nonsense.

Noticeably lacking is the perspective of the Russians. The official
narrative says that the Russians are reactive cavemen with no ability to
think long term. That is what Caldwell assumes to be true, because his
friends in the system say it is true. The truth is Russia, China and
India are the long term planners. It is the West that wakes up every
morning, reacts to what is happening and then gets busy fabricating new
narratives so they can win the media war that day.

Because Christopher Caldwell is firmly rooted on the other side of the
great divide, his analysis is inevitably controlled by it. Like the
people from the movie living in the matrix, he is basing his
understanding of the world on a general falsehood. He rests his analysis
on a fabricated reality that serves the interests of the system but is
no more connected to reality than a science fiction movie. His analysis
is true as long as the rules of the system remain unchanged, which is
impossible.

Notice also how Caldwell just accepts that the reason Washington has
been meddling in Ukraine is they seek to promote democracy. Again, this
is a conveniently self-serving claim from the people running foreign
policy, but it has no basis in fact. The same people eagerly excluding
vast numbers of Americans from the political system are certainly not
spreading the hope and joy of democracy. Caldwell assumes the best from
his friends in the system, so he accepts their claims.

None of this is to suggest Caldwell is a bad person or that he is
stupid. It is that he lives in the false reality of official orthodoxy.
On that side of the great divide, these things are true because they are
necessary for the current narrative. On this side of the great divide,
these things are false because they are false. It is the motivation
behind these false narratives that is the starting point for dissident
analysis, which results in an entirely different view of the war and the
world.

That is what it means to be a dissident. The people who are constantly
droning on about reality being a social construct are living in a social
construct. Theirs is a world where things are true because the rules of
the narrative require them to be true, but once the narrative is no
longer operative, the rules change. It is how the people threatened
violence against those refusing the Covid vaccine can so easily shift to
blaming the whole fiasco on the people who criticized it.

Perhaps the better way to put it is that the last stop on the train that
carries people to this side of the great divide is the understanding
that the genuine crisis in the modern age is the contradiction between
reality and official orthodoxy. To return to the movie trope, freedom
only comes from destroying the matrix. There is no reform within it,
because there is no reality within it. The myth of the modern age is
that the modern age is in anyway attached to the reality of the human
condition.
