One of the unexpected consequences of the technological revolution is
the death of the popular music industry. The sale of physical content
has just about disappeared, outside of the vinyl subculture. Even if you
count downloads, the gross sales of music decline more than ten percent
per year. On a per capita basis, popular music revenues are a little
more than half of their peak fifty years ago. The biggest drop in sales
started with the introduction of the mp3.

Unlike the newspaper industry, which thought they could make money
giving their content away on the internet, the music industry always saw
technology as a threat to their business model. They famously fought the
introduction of cassettes because it would make it easier to record and
transport music. If you could copy that album and give the copy to a
friend, the music industry reasoned, there would be no reason for the
friend to buy the album.

The music industry went to extraordinary lengths to protect their
cartel, but they simply could not hold off the flood of technology. They
treated downloaders like the Israelis treat Palestinian civilians, but
it failed to deter people from downloading free copies of the song they
wanted. Eventually, the industry gave into reality and started selling
single copies of songs, but by that point, the horse had left the barn.
There are too many ways to get a copy of a song free of charge.

The hope was streaming services would stem the bleeding. Instead of
loading up on free music maybe people would pay five bucks a month to
have access to everything all the time from anywhere. That did seem to
work for a while, but then it just further cratered the music sales side
of the business. There is also the fact that the public does not listen
to as much pop music as in the past. Part of it is demographics, but
part of it is the collapse in the quality of content.

This is starting to damage the last area where money could be made in
the music business, which is the live show. For the first time in a
decade, excluding the Covid years, live shows are in <a
href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/concert-ticket-sales-decline-19562990.php"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">decline</a>. The popular <a
href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-cure-robert-smith-ticketmaster-scam-1235132969/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">excuse</a> is to blame the ticket sellers
and the secondary market for pricing people out of the events. The claim
is the ticket sellers are gouging the consumer with demand-based
pricing, which is like saying no one goes to a restaurant because it is
too crowded.

One reason for the decline of live shows is Covid. A weird thing
happened during Covid and that is people discovered that they could live
without things they suddenly could not have due to the panic.
Restaurants never fully recovered from Covid because people got used to
not going out to dinner. Something replaced it. Live events are another
thing people did not miss as much as expected. Pro sports have had to
work hard to regain their crowds and college sports never fully regained
them.

Another reason live music is struggling is the quality of the product.
As the industry relies more on technology to create listenable content,
the less able they are to stage compelling live shows. This is not a new
problem. In the golden age of pop music, they often used studio
musicians to record the songs. The “band” often could not play their own
music at all. This limited the “band” to doing studio shows where they
could lip-sync to the recorded music.

This changed in the 1960’s when bands could play their own music and
insisted on recording their own music. They also did live shows where
they could actually play their stuff and not sound like a bag of cats.
Technology has reversed this so that the performers are no longer able
to produce the songs live in any way that sounds like the recorded
material. Technology has made it easier to make music, but that has
resulted in fewer acts that can do live shows.

Here is where you see the damage done by hip-hop. This is content easy
to create in the studio, but it is hot garbage when performed live. In a
small venue, the tight spaces and use of drugs can result in a good time
for the audience, but in an arena it is often hilariously terrible. It
looks like that homeless guy who yells at passing cars got on the stage
and is yelling at the audience. Whatever the merits, there are none,
hip-hop does not make for a compelling live show.

Another issue for live music is young people are not being socialized in
the meat space, so live shows fall outside of their comfort zone. A
generation used to interacting with their peers through internet
platforms is not going to see the live show as an opportunity for
socializing and dating like the old days. They would rather hear the
music while cartoon characters perform the concert online. For a
generation that prefers the indoors, the outdoor music show may as well
not exist.

Of course, the music business was always a racket. The golden years of
pop was when the music companies ruled with an iron fist. They could
make you buy the album when you wanted just one or two songs. They
forced radio stations to play the songs they wanted played. Most
important, they we free to rob the music acts. Technology nibbled away
at the music cartel eventually freeing the consumers and the music
creators from the clutches of the music companies.

One result is there is probably more music available now than in the
golden age of popular music. Creators can make good stuff from their
bedroom and make it available to the world via the internet. The other
side of this is the days of the rock star are coming to a close. Taylor
Swift is probably the last mega star and her fame is mostly due to her
general weirdness. Her songs are popular because she is popular, not the
other way around. Her music is secondary to her act.

Otherwise, the golden era of popular music, especially rock music, will
be viewed as a strange artifact of the American empire. A generation
from now that music may sound as weird and alien to young people as
Chinese opera. They will not understand it, because the people and
culture that produced it are as alien to them as the people and culture
of China. The concept of the rock star will disappear with memories of
phone booths and quadrophonic sound.
