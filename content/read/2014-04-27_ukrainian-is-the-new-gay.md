A big part of radical politics is the public display of piety. Members
of the Left have a habit of displaying their piety in the same way women
display charms on a bracelet. They make a big deal of letting everyone
know they have a gay friend or a black friend. They don’t think of these
people as people, of course. They are props, charms to hang on their
bracelet that they rattle in public to signal to everyone they are a
pious person.

Way back in the Bush years, liberals all claimed to know a moderate
Muslim, who was like a suburban white guy, just a Muslim. It was
hilarious how these otherwise irreligious people suddenly turned into
Muslim scholars. They still hated Christians, but they were now experts
on the Koran. They just knew that Islam was great. Proof was their
imaginary Muslim friends and co-workers.

They never read the Koran and most likely had no Muslim acquaintances.
It was just a public act of piety. They needed that charm on their
bracelet. The funny part is they all repeated the same claims, as if
they were reading from a script. Since these people read the same narrow
set of website and watch the same news programs, it is no surprise they
make the same arguments, sing the same songs and read the same lines
from the catechism.

In the homosexual marriage debate, every liberal friends suddenly
sprouted homosexual friends. The fact that the supply of homosexuals was
far outstripped by the claims never came up. Unsurprisingly, there was
no talk about the Muslim friends who just a few years ago were allegedly
confirming all of the claims of the Left. The prominent charms on the
piety bracelet were all gay all day.

Now we are seeing Ukrainians turn up in conversation. On the one hand,
many leftists are Jewish and have family roots in this part of the world
leads to an obsession with Russia and the old Pale of Settlement. On the
other hand, the gentiles now need to feel like experts on this new
thing. More important, they need to personalize it, so all of a suddenly
their gay friend is out and their Ukrainian friend is in.
