**Media Note:** I was on the Counter-Currents livestream Sunday. <a
href="https://counter-currents.com/2020/10/counter-currents-radio-the-z-man/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here</a> is the recorded
version of it for your listening pleasure. I will be on the
<a href="https://dlive.tv/theralphretort" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Killstream</a> this Wednesday to celebrate the life and
times of Abraham Lincoln. The show starts somewhere around 9:00 PM
eastern and runs for a couple of hours. I’m now posting content to my
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog"

trying my hand at movie reviews.

The general consensus regarding the future of the American Empire is
that it is headed for demise like all empires. The rapidly declining
quality of the ruling elite in general and the political class in
particular is the biggest sign. Then there is the changing demographics,
which will reach a point where the human capital of the empire can no
longer support empire. Then there is the life cycle of all empires. This
one, while short lived, seems to be in the late phase of that cycle.

Most people focus on the question of when the empire will collapse, as
that provides the most thrilling scenarios. The truth is though, empires
collapse in slow motion, rather than in a bang. It is like a fall down a
long flight of stairs, in which the empire hits some long landings where
it seems to right itself for a period. Then it is another tumble down
the stairs until it hits another landing. It is only in the fullness of
time that the decline and fall of the empire looks like the familiar
arc.

A different question worth pondering is what will the decline and fall
look like for the average person living in the empire? For the people
living in the provinces, it will look like the past, in that Europe and
Asia will simply gain their independence. France may become a vassal of
Germany or Russia, but that is just the same condition with a different
management team at the top. Europe will get poorer and more violent, but
that will mostly be due to massive migration from Africa.

In North America, we have some hints as to what post-empire America will
look like for the typical person. [This
post](https://amgreatness.com/2020/09/27/the-third-worlding-of-america/)
on American Greatness goes into the third world nature of large swaths
of current year America. California now looks more like Sinaloa Mexico
than the old America of the young empire. There are nice modern parts
for sure, but there are backward primitive parts, as well. Just like the
Roman Empire, it is the infrastructure that is the leading edge of
decline.

Empires that can no longer maintain their borders tend to attract large
peasant classes, because long after the empire’s peak, it remains a
better place to be poor than outside the empire. America lost control of
its borders a generation ago, so something like fifty million people
have relocated to America. There may be that many more operating inside
the country illegally. The fact that no one knows or cares about the
illegal population is one of those signs of collapse.

Another vision for post-empire America, is post-empire Spain. One of the
interesting aspects of that period is how power devolved to local power
centers. The Visigothic Kingdom ruled over what is now Spain. They were
central Europeans who had moved west from the Danube Valley, first under
the protection of the Western Roman Empire, but then by conquest after
the fall of Rome. The kingdom maintained independence for about three
centuries.

The thing is though, the kingdom was a polite fiction in many ways as
the Gothic rulers had limited control of their territory. They were
dependent on those local power centers that evolved in the late Roman
empire. The emerging Catholic Church was one power center, but so were
local ruling elites located in cities like Seville and Toledo. This is
the root of antisemitism, by the way. Jews were powerful players in
Gothic politics, a rival to the Church for influence over the secular
authorities.

That’s probably the future of North America. The federal government will
carry on long after it can exert control over the whole of the country.
We see that today with the inability of the political class to do the
obvious with the tech oligarchs. Today, global enterprise, finance and
technology are outside the scope of government authority and often the
whip hand in the relationship. We’re seeing states and cities in open
revolt now, refusing to abide by federal laws.

One question no one in power thinks about is whether or not these new
oligarchs can survive without the national government. The oligarchs
that emerged from the Soviet empire were rooted in practical things like
oil and gas. American oligarchs have power over abstract concepts that
exist only because the state protects them. Both finance and technology
are able to siphon off the wealth of the middle-class, because the
middle-class supports the state, which protects this racket.

Put another way, Bolshevism made the Soviet empire artificially poorer,
as it compelled inefficiency in the economy. It also proved to be a
costly form of rule. Collapse freed the economy of the empire, allowing
the new oligarchs to emerge. Liberal democracy makes the empire
artificially richer, as it relies upon financial legerdemain to pull
forward the proceeds of labor and capital. The cost of rule is
subsidized by the social capital it consumes to perpetuate itself.

Is it possible for local power centers to emerge in North America, when
the regions no longer have an identity of their own? Is it possible for
local rule, when the local elites are just as inept and corrupt as the
national elites? It is hard to imagine California lasting very long as
an independent state. Its ruling class is clownish and stupid, a
collection of petulant children. How hard would it be for the drug
cartels to push them aside and turn the state into another narco-state?

The Soviet system rewarded cleverness and intrigue but it was founded on
force, so there was always a role for those willing to act. The American
system rewards guile, but increasingly has no role for assertiveness and
force. It is why America has become so bad at waging war. It is possible
that we now lack the required lions to push aside the foxes, even when
the foxes die. It means a long period of chaos in which a new generation
of lions can emerge to seize control.

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
