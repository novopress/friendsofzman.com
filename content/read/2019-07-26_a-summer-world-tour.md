The custom in the independent media game is to do something to recognize
milestones like anniversaries or certain show numbers. July not only
marked the two year anniversary of this show, but gave us the 100th
episode as well. I did not acknowledge the anniversary, as it fell on
the holiday break. I also forgot all about it until I was putting this
post together and looked it up. As far as this milestone, I could not
think of anything special to do, so I just stuck with the normal
program.

Showing up is the big challenge for this sort of venture. Most
podcasters and vloggers start strong, but after a few months start
missing shows, posting late and eventually quit before their first year.
The same is true of bloggers. In some cases the grind of sticking to a
schedule is the issue, but for others it is simply that they run out of
material. They also get disappointed by not becoming a star right away.
Once the novelty wears off, they start to lose interest and eventually
quit doing it.

That’s the trick though. When I started the blog, I had no idea what I
wanted to do with it, so I tried a bunch of different things and kept at
it until I found a style and process that I enjoyed. That took about a
year. Then I noticed the audience starting to tick up ever so slowly. I
think it was late in year two that some people with big followings
noticed me and started linking my posts. That brought lots of traffic
and the site grew like a weed ever since. Showing up eventually pays
off.

The same pattern has emerged with the podcast. I had done some
interviews and people suggested I try doing a podcast. I had no idea how
it worked or what I would do, so I just started doing stuff and figuring
it out. Two years in and I’m still trying new stuff to both mix things
up and to figure out what works for me. Episode one had a grand total of
300 listens. Now a show gets thousands of listens the first day. I have
no way of knowing how many people listen via Google and Apple.

The point here, is if you are planning to do a blog, create a YouTube
channel or some other type of on-line activity, sticking with it is the
main challenge. Eventually you figure out what works for you and in the
process you build an audience. That audience will tell you what works
and what does not work. Eventually, the process becomes natural and
something you enjoy doing every day, even on the bad days. For me,
writing and podcasting is a shelter from the storm.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
