One of the curiosities of this age is that no one ever asks the simplest
of questions when faced with a social justice warrior. That question is
“Who says?” Given that our society is drenched in moralizing, it seems
like a good question. After all, any demands about what you ought to do
have to come with a moral authority. The reason you must do something or
not do something is because X says so.

What makes this even weirder is the taboos are not passed down to us
from some ancient source that we no longer remember. The prohibition
against making crossdresser jokes was made up a few years ago. The taboo
on noticing things about group behavior dates back to the last century.
It seems logical that people would want to know by whose authority these
things are now taboo.

Maybe that is why the taboos proliferate. The explosion of things that
are now prohibited or required is a form of squid ink. Keeping everyone
busy sorting through the latest rules keeps them from asking this basic
question. The reason for this is there is no adequate answer to this
question. The moral code of what we call our democracy rests on nothing
more than an empty space where God and tradition existed.

On the other hand, maybe this is just the natural end point of the
process that got going in the late Middle Ages. The search for a
rational explanation for normative claims like justice and equality has
led us to the madness of this age. Since reason cannot be a moral
authority, we have created something like the Krebs cycle that throws
off novel taboos through the destruction of inherited traditions and
customs.

It could also be that humans are moral animals. Common morality is what
is needed to hold a large society together, so extreme selection
pressure has been in favor of those who naturally assume there is a
moral authority for a moral claim. Perhaps most of us are bred to never
ask who says? Those who lack this natural instinct and dare ask this
question end up thinking about it on the fringes of society.
