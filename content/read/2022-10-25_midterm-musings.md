------------------------------------------------------------------------

The midterm election is two weeks away and we are seeing the predictable
pattern in the polling and news coverage. Whenever there is a Democrat
in the White House, the regime media works feverishly to convince
everyone he is the next Lincoln, but the voters think otherwise. Fake
polls are released claiming the president is more popular than sex and
the media is full of stories about doomed Republicans. Then autumn hits
and everything swings the other way.

This pattern started in 1994. Bill Clinton was some weird mash up of
John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Al Goldstein. Supposedly,
everyone loved Bill Clinton, even most Republican voters. In fairness,
most people probably did like Bill Clinton as a picaresque character.
They feared and loathed his deranged old lady, so they ran to the
nearest Republican at the first opportunity. The GOP picked up eight
Senate seats and 54 House seats in a sea change election.

This pattern did not hold in 2002, when newly minted president George W
Bush went into his first midterm. The media spent a lot of time
carefully explaining how this mumbling fellow was Hitler, but no one
fell for it. His endless slobbering over Israel was probably the clue.
That and the fact that his administration had more Jews in it than an
accounting convention. The Republicans actually picked up a few Senate
seats and lost just one House seat.

Fast forward to 2010 and they are back to the old tricks. Black Jesus is
in the White House and the media is carefully explaining to white people
that voting against his party was the most racist thing you could do. Of
course, the Republicans agreed with them because that is what they
always do. In a rare example of white people breaking from their
conditioning, they risked being called racist and voted Republican. The
GOP picked up seven Senate seats and 63 House seats.

Here we are with another Democrat in the White House and it is looking
like another example of the pattern. The races that were allegedly
competitive, like the Florida governor’s race, are not going to be
close. Ron DeSantis is going to [cruise to
victory](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/566100-its-over-new-miami-dade-poll-foreshadows-commanding-ron-desantis-win/)
and probably carry a lot of Republicans with him. Firebrand girl boss
Kari Lake was supposedly a long shot, but now it appears she will win
that race. In fact, Arizona may go all Republican this cycle.

Then you have the weird races. In 1994 and 2010 there were races in
areas no one thought would be competitive that were suddenly
competitive. The same thing is happening this time around. Tiffany
Smiley is
[neck-and-neck](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/patty-murray-still-leads-but-tiffany-smiley-closes-gap-in-new-wa-poll/)
with grizzled hag Patty Murray in Washington state. The Oregon
governor’s race is getting tight and the Michigan governor’s race could
be close. The narrative makers are struggling to convince their core
audience that the narratives are true.

What all of this points to is a big night for the Republicans and a glum
night for the regime toadies and sycophants. The question is the
numbers. Demographics and vote rigging probably limit the damage. The
best estimate for the Republicans is 40-50 seats in the House and a one
or two seat majority in the Senate. Given the condition of the president
and the world, this red wave should dwarf the previous red waves, but
there is no getting around the demographic issue.

As the New York Times helpfully [points
out](https://news.yahoo.com/america-vanishing-trump-insist-were-115731851.html),
this election is a rear guard action by white America in response to the
Great Replacement. The same people who repeatedly demand you say that
demographic replacement is a conspiracy theory are consoling their
readers with the knowledge that white people will be gone soon. Of
course, their readers are uniformly white, but that is a detail. Hating
white people is too important to worry about such trivialities.

They are not entirely wrong, of course. The white portion of the vote is
in sharp decline and will be a minority of the vote in a generation. It
will remain the biggest bloc so if it becomes racially aware, then it is
big trouble for the regime, which is why they are so invested in
preventing that from happening. In order to keep this system running,
they need whites on opposite sides. That way the other tribes become the
deciding vote and they are easy for the regime to manipulate.

There is another thing that is becoming clear. The quality of the
options, like the quality of popular culture, is in steep decline.
Pennsylvania is leading the way, with a Senate race featuring a brain
damaged hobo and a Turkish carny. Georgia is not far behind, featuring
two black guys with “colorful” histories. Serious adults are starved for
serious choices at the ballot box, so they are left with symbolic ones.
Voting Republican is now the same as voting none of the above.

From the dissident perspective, the election results are meaningless, as
the first step along the dissident trail is realizing the game is
rigged. Elections in a liberal democracy are always heads they win,
tails you lose. The Democrats are “heads” and the Republicans are
“tails”, reflecting the relationship of the parties. It is another
example of how the universe has a sense of humor. White people vote
Republican only to be finked on by the Republicans whenever they win an
election.

Even so, there is the entertainment quality. Over the next two weeks the
narrative shops will be tasked with producing new versions of reality.
Fragile old geezers like Nancy Pelosi will be sent out to stumble
through the latest message. Joe Biden will be sent out to shake hands
with invisible people and fondle little girls in public, while reminding
everyone he should be in a home. Democracy is a theater that always ends
in the theater of the absurd.

That said, there are little green shoots from the dissident perspective.
Guys like J. D. Vance and Blake Masters have managed to shrug off the
racism stuff, which suggests it is losing it power over white people.
Doug Mastriano is probably as close to a dissident candidate running and
he is doing well, despite being called all the usual scare words by the
usual suspects. The election results will not matter in the short term,
but they point to positive long term trends for dissidents.
