When was the last time you changed your mind? Most likely the answer
takes some time as humans tend not to change their opinion on things
that much and when they do, it happens over a slow period. Most people
on this side of the great divide did not wake up one day and decided to
abandon their old worldview. People slowly came to realize that the old
way of looking at things was not working and then all of a sudden, they
noticed lots of other people noticing the same thing.

That has always been the reality of the red pill experience. It is not
so much that the person getting red pilled is going through a sudden
transformation but that they are suddenly noticing lots of other people
who are on the same road. Almost everyone in the dissident space came
here by first running into a writer, YouTuber or social media character
that articulated what they were thinking. Then it was another and
another until the person was firmly in the dissident camp.

We see this with support for Israel. For a long time, the default
position for most white people was to support Israel, mostly for
American reasons. Americans love the underdog and Israel seemed like the
underdog. In the 1960’s and 1970’s the Israelis had to fend off the much
larger neighbors, often working together. The fact that Israel somehow
beat the bigger opponent tickled the American respect for the small dog
that has the heart of the big dog.

That changed starting with the Bush years. After being pummeled and
denigrated for a couple of decades by the American war machine,
Americans look at the Arabs as hapless nitwits and Israel as a
protectorate of the American empire. The Jews are no longer the plucky
underdog, so when they attacked the Palestinians, many Americans
wondered if they should be cheering for the people of Gaza. As a result,
support for Israel has plummeted over the last six months.

There are still people who think it is 1985 and that Israel is “fighting
for its survival” but those people are strange anachronisms. This has in
turn damaged the Republican Party as they roll out anti-speech measures
thinking these prohibitions against criticizing Israel are popular with
their base. Instead, most GOP voters are reacting in the same way they
would if Mike Johnson showed up for work wearing a denim leisure suit
and sporting a massive afro.

It is not that people are suddenly reading Mein Kampf and becoming
antisemites or that they accidentally clicked on a Nick Fuentes video
and were red pilled on the reality of Zionism in America. What happened
is the tectonic plates of American perception have been slowly moving
with regards to Israel for decades. The events in the Levant confirmed
these changing perceptions and when people noticed this in other people,
a critical mass of new opinion has formed around Israel.

We may be seeing something similar with regards to white identity. The
other day, Ann Coulter was a guest on a podcast hosted by former
presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to do the normal stuff. Coulter
opened by <a
href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/ramaswamy-hails-ann-coulter-for-telling-him-flat-out-to-my-face-she-wouldnt-vote-for-him-because-hes-an-indian/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stating</a> right up front that she would
not have voted for him, despite agreeing with him on many things,
because he is an Indian and she does not want to be ruled by Indians.
She went on to say that America is a white country and should remain so.

The normally unflappable Ramaswamy was poleaxed. He probably expected
Coulter to attack Trump, as that is her current act. He would then
defend Trump, as he is a Trump surrogate on the campaign trail. Instead,
he was told by a very white woman that she would never vote for a very
brown man. To his credit, Ramaswamy did not begin to shriek about
racism, but then again, Indians are the most ethnocentric people on
earth so at some level he certainly understood her position.

The remarkable thing about this exchange is not that she said it, but
that there has been no reaction from the kooks. Further, the sissies of
conservatism have not raced off to their fainting couches. In fact,
there has been little reaction at all to what in the near past would
have been a John Derbyshire moment. A few members of the kook squad have
tried to make this a thing, but so far there are no mobs forming up to
demand Coulter be cancelled from her various media gigs.

The important thing here is not so much that Coulter said what she said
or that it has not resulted in a lynching. The important thing is that
millions of normies heard a familiar voice say it is, in effect, okay to
be white. It is one of those crystalizing moments for the suburban
peasant when he realizes that lots of other people are thinking the same
thing and that it is okay to think such things. The ground just shifted
but in reality, the ground shifted long ago, and Coulter simply
acknowledged it.

Like the changing views on Israel, the changing views on whiteness are
the result of the winners overplaying their hand. The Israel lobby has
made itself so obnoxious that it has turned natural sympathy into
skepticism and even antipathy. The triumph of diversity has now
normalized racial tribalism among white people. This Ann Coulter moment
has confirmed to millions of normies that it is not only okay to be
white, but it is a necessity of their politics now.
