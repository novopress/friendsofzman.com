The readers who still cling to libertarianism have given me hell over my
screed against their faith. I’m not without some sympathy for them. The
core libertarian impulse to leave people alone in order to be left alone
is admirable. If you are a libertarian, trying hard to live the
non-aggression principle, it probably seems unfair that a hate thinker
from the extreme Right is mocking your thing. I get that and I respect
it to a point. That point is when I see something like this from the
Pope of Modern Libertarianism.

It should be impossible to be this stupid. I suspect for most of human
existence, idiots who said moronic things like this tried to hand feed
bears or cuddle with large reptiles, thus eliminating themselves from
the the system. There’s no other way to read this than Nick Gillespie
believes some minor alterations to the French tax code will ameliorate
this.

Now, does Nick Gillespie really think altering tax policy will magically
transform low-IQ, inbred Muslims from the Maghreb into patriotic French
republicans who work at Parisian software shops? It’s tempting to say it
is just another pose, but the evidence is piling up in favor of the
argument that Nick Gillespie is a stupid person. Anyone who truly
believes altering tax policy will reverse a thousand generations of
evolution is an idiot.

That’s the fundamental problem with modern libertarians. They believe
this or they simply are incapable of mastering ground floor level
biology. The reason the country of Niger is a basket case is that’s the
way the people of Niger want it. It is full of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_people"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hausa</a>. The reason Paris
was Paris was that, up until recently, it was full of Parisians! Now
that Paris is filling up with North Africans and Arabs, it is looking
like Algeria with better plumbing.

What’s happened to libertarians is a form of what someone calls
convergence. It used to be that libertarians accepted the chain of
causality. They worked backward in order to arrive, obliquely, at the
first cause. If you wanted to have a nation of maximum freedom, you had
to have a nation with rational laws and that meant a rational,
Anglo-Saxon culture. The result was a libertarianism in one country
model.

Then a new breed of libertarian showed up mouthing all the economic
arguments of libertarians, often with the zeal of a fanatic, but
embracing liberal cultural arguments, re-framing them in terms of
personal liberty. The result is libertarians have almost fully converged
now with the liberals. They have been assimilated into the Borg.
Libertarianism, like most libertarians, is all about someone else paying
for their ethic dining habits.

It’s why they are no longer of any use to the Right.
