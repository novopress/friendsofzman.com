<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This excellent blog</a> post is a
reminder of that
<a href="https://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/95q2/sluts.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">old joke</a> the difference between
theory and reality. Anyone familiar with business analyst types knows
exactly why ObamaCare is collapsing. In the dreaded private sector,
there are people who are experts on business theory, marketing their
technology theory and so on. They make a nice living creating models of
reality that can never exist in the real world. What they never do, of
course, is run an actual enterprise that exists in the real world.

Government, free of the need to turn a profit, are loaded with these
sorts of experts and theorists. The army of health care experts and
policy wonks has been desperate to test out their theories on the
American public for decades. The result is a system that incorporates
all of the latest fads. This is the norm in all government initiates.
Anyone who has worked on a government project knows the drill. The
design included in the original contract fails on contact with reality.
Then bids go out to fix it.

Social democracies like ours take this approach with all projects. It is
why government seems to be getting increasingly inept. Fifty years ago
NASA could go from zero to moon landing in five years. Seventy years ago
America went from no army and in depression to conquering the world
while beating Hitler and Tojo within a decade. Today, they can’t build a
website in five years. Here we are 12 years on and the World Trade
Center is not completed. The Empire State building was built in a year,
start to occupancy.

Contra the blogger, it is not just technology. It is everything. Obama
announced last week that he and his team were stunned to learn that
insurance is complicated. Amazingly, he thought this was an insight. How
is it possible that an American could possibly have made it to adulthood
not knowing this? That’s the reality of political class. They are so
divorced from reality that they are stunned to learn that insurance is
completed. The administrative layer is even more oblivious to the
reality of the modern world.

That’s the lesson here with ObamaCare. The people in charge only have a
vague understanding of how our highly complex modern society works. They
know America through polling, policy debates and campaigning. The
political class is thoroughly insulated from the land over which they
rule. Because these people are inoculated from the consequences, they
can be cavalier in their
ignorance. <span style="line-height: 1.625;">Their loyalties, however,
are to the political class as evidenced by the </span><a

<span style="line-height: 1.625;">and IRS scandals.</span>

In that regard, ObamaCare is emblematic of what’s wrong and a good proxy
for what we can expect going forward.
