rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> is getting the
usual suspects very upset for all the usual reasons, but the really
interesting part is the guy is called Hispanic. Most people think of
Hispanics as the little brown guys riding the leaf blower. The guy in
the picture looks like he could be auditioning for a show about World
War II. Then again, our elites like their Hispanics the same way they
like their black guys. That is superficially diverse, but otherwise
white.

Barak Obama is the quintessential black guy because he looks black, but
is otherwise a typical white guy from upper class white culture. In the
case of Hispanics, the archetype is a Caucasian with three names and a
Spanish accent. Juan Pablo fits the bill and that’s most likely why he
was selected. It is a terribly shallow and fundamentally inhuman way to
view people, but American elites are not too concerned about the
feelings of the people.

The weirdness of left-wing identity politics is that it strips people of
their identity in order to affirm the identity of liberal elites. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They declared this guy
non-white</a>, despite the fact he was super-white. Put another way, he
has to deny himself in order to properly actualize his full identity
within the framework of multiculturalism. The whole thing is insane, of
course, but nothing about multiculturalism makes any sense when you
examine it.
