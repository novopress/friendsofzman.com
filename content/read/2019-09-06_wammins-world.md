For the first show after the short summer break, I decided to go with a
topic that I think is going to be a major theme of 2020. I wrote a post
the other day suggesting that the 2020 election will be both one last
hurrah for the Woodstock generation, as well as a modern battle of the
sexes. We thought the wammin issue was settled when Trump dropped a
house on Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it looks like her ideological
soulmate will be the nominee for 2020, so the wammin war will continue.

The interesting thing about this renewed war on the sexes is it will no
doubt be covered exclusively from the female perspective. Since the
media assumes the female perspective is youngish, single and urban,
rather than middle-aged, married and suburban, which is closer to
reality, the reporting will reflect the feminist lunacy we have come to
associate with the issue. Trump did about the same with women in 2016 as
Obama did in 2012, but the media assumes women hate Trump anyway.

Where Trump won the 2016 election was with men, specifically white men.
He doubled the Obama 2012 margin and did as well as Bush with white men.
If you are building a case for Trump winning in 2020, it starts with
Warren winning the nomination. Men do not like her and it appears blacks
are not enthusiastic about her. Warren seems to poll worse than Clinton
with those two groups. On the other hand, she seems to cast a magic
spell on professional women. I have a segment on that this week.

The thing about the war of the sexes is that it is really a war on
normal women. When you examine the arguments from the Left and from
feminists, not a lot of it is aimed at changing male behavior that is
beneficial to women. Mostly it is aimed at eliminating the protections a
healthy society has for its women. The resulting social breakdown
creates more unhappy women, who can then be recruited into the coven of
feminism. To what end, other than collapse, is never articulated.

One media note. This weekend I will be filling in on the FTN weekend
broadcast. I will be co-hosting with Ethnarch, covering the news of the
day. I’m not sure if Allsup will be on, but it could just be the two of
us. The whiny millennials, who always moan about Boomers will be treated
to some rugged Gen-X posting.  Maybe it will toughen some of you sissies
up a little bit. The site is
<a href="http://fashthenation.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">here</a> and I’ll post a link to it here once they post
it up on their site. It should be up Saturday evening.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
