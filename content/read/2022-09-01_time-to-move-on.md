Anyone who has been through a breakup, like a divorce or the dissolution
of a business partnership, knows they take on a life of their own. There
is rarely one thing that sets the relationship off on the path to
destruction. It is the accumulation of small things that build to an
undefinable point where the relationship shifts from natural cooperation
to natural opposition. Actions that used to build cooperation suddenly
become points of contention until the two sides realize the relationship
must end.

This is the dynamic in which most civic nationalist now find themselves
with their old partner the “founding documents.” For longer than the
memory of man runneth not to the contrary, the civic nationalist has
looked at his citizenship as defined by the partnership with the
founding of America. The Declaration and to a lesser extent the
Constitution have been his life partner. These documents and the
mythology that has been created around them are what make him whole.

These documents, along with the founding itself, exist within the larger
definition of America that the civic nationalist will defend with his
life. There is some variation in that some of them still promote the
melting pot idea while others are in the creedal camp, but all of them
are married to the general concept of America. They will defend America
from critics on all sides, mostly from the Right, of course, but they
will even make some noises about defending their love from the Left as
well.

The problem is America does not love them anymore. Those founding
documents, the marriage certificate of the relationship, no longer
matter to America. The reason America keeps them locked away and rarely
mentions them is they are just not that important because the
relationship is not that important. America is ready to move onto to the
new vibrant stage of its life. That means leaving behind the old phase,
the marriage to the civic nationalists.

Like a jilted lover, the civic nationalists cannot accept it. <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/08/attacking-the-declaration-of-independence-is-not-conservatism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example in a legacy
publication defending the Declaration. The elevation of the Declaration
over the actual founding documents of the country was the result of a
prior rough patch in the relationship during the last century. The
Caesarism of Roosevelt needed to be addressed, like an infidelity in a
relationship. The solution was provided by Harry Jaffe, a second rate
scholar who peddled bromides to third rate thinkers.

There was no way to square what the progressives had done in the first
half of the twentieth century with the text and spirit of the
Constitution. There was no way to challenge them as they controlled the
important bits of society. The solution was to embrace a form of
Jacobinism. America was now defined, so the theory goes, by the
egalitarian spirit of the Declaration. This also allowed them to embrace
the tyrant Lincoln as their new Moses.

The new vision of America the civic nationalist created in response to
the authoritarianism of the new regime was made to look like tradition
by rewriting the founding history. The real founding document was the
Declaration. The Constitution was an imperfect compromise to get
started. The Civil War was an effort to address the big flaws to bring
the document in line with the Declaration. The Gettysburg Address was a
restatement of the genuine founding ideal.

This is utter nonsense, but it kept the relationship going. Like the
cuckold who convinces himself the wife is taking night classes at the
university so she can get a better job once the kids are in school, the
civic nationalists occupied themselves with the Lincoln fantasy.
Meanwhile, the America they loved was getting busy with every left-wing
fad that came out of the academy. She was no longer even trying to
pretend that she cared about the relationship with the civic
nationalists.

There are some civic nationalists who see the problem. They hope to
refashion the relationship around something they call common good
conservatism, which creates an open marriage between themselves and the
Constitution. America can still carry on with the latest thing, as long
as it does not threaten the marriage. The common good civic nationalists
will step in to enforce discipline when needed. They imagine the cuckold
finally gaining the courage to call his wife home.

In fairness, there are
<a href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/a-post-originalism-common-good/,"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">some</a> within the civic nationalist
space who sense that the relationship is over and it is time to move on.
They mostly focus on the old originalism idea embraced by the legal wing
of civic nationalism. Originalism seeks to elevate the text of the
Constitution over legal aspirations to the contrary. The problem is they
are left to defend a document that was flawed from the start and has
been butchered by previous efforts to minimize it.

The hard cold truth is that the America the civic nationalists claim to
love is not around anymore and she is never coming back. In fact, she
never really existed. It was a creation of the last century. The America
of the founding died at Gettysburg and was buried in Reconstruction. It
took two wars in the 20th century to create a replacement, which
maintained the trappings of the original, but was fundamentally
different from the republic fashioned by the Founders.

The crisis of the present is not over the strains in the old
relationship with the America imagined by the civic nationalists. It is
the result of the America formed in the 20th century having no rationale
in the 21st century. The America of the civic nationalist is dust in a
grave, left untended in the 19th century. Not only is she never coming
back, but she also cannot be replaced with anything similar. Like the
cuckold whose wife has left for good, the civic nationalists need to
move on with their lives.

Whatever comes next is going to be fashioned by those who close the door
on the past and accept the present, along with what future can be made
of it. There are lessons to be gleaned from America’s past. There are
lessons to be gleaned from the Franco-Prussian War and Revolutions of
1848. Those lessons only matter if they are put to use understanding the
present in order to create a future. That future is not going to include
the founding documents moldering away in a museum.
