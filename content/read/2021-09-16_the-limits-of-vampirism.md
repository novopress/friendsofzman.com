Imagine if tomorrow, the Federal Reserve announced that the top ten home
builders in the United States are insolvent. They would cease paying
interest on debt and probably would default on principal payments.
Further, their bonds would be frozen for some period as the Fed sorted
through their finances. It is not too hard to imagine as 13 years ago
something close happened when Lehmen Brothers collapsed. It started a
long financial panic and then a long recession.

Something similar is now happening in China. The nation’s largest
developer is no longer able to pay its creditors. The Chinese government
announced yesterday that the firm will not make interest payments and
probably will default on principal payments, although that remains
unclear. China Evergrande has liabilities over $300 billion, but this is
China, so no one knows the real number. All anyone knows is they sit at
the heart of the Chinese financial and real estate system.

One thing that is universally true in all times and all places, even in
China, is that real estate is the base asset. Mother Nature is not
making more of it, so it remains a constant and therefore the basis of
all value. It is why this development is not just another story of
corrupt financial dealings. As in the West, all land in China is
leveraged and that leverage is treated as an asset, which means it is
leveraged. If Evergrande stops paying its bill, many other firms stop
paying their bills.

At this point, the financial world is not all that concerned with what
is happening in Chinese real estate, but they were not concerned about
the mortgage crisis in the United States until it was a pending
disaster. The old claim that financial markets look forward and
therefore offer a glimpse of the future was always nonsense, but the
Lehman disaster proved that markets are not the future. The world of
finance assumes tomorrow will be yesterday but better.

At the minimum, the Evergrande crisis is a test of the new Chinese model
of governance ushered in under Xi Jinping. The relatively loose days of
Chinese capitalism are coming to a close as the party imposes new rules
on the economy and cracks down on its pirates. The focus is now on
domestic growth, rather than cheap labor and exports. China is no longer
the cheapest or most productive labor market in the world, so it cannot
remain an export economy.

No one really knows if China can successfully make the turn from export
economy to one driven by domestic consumption. The breathtaking
modernization of the country is impressive, but that required massive
cooperation from the West. If the United States had a ruling class
concerned with the welfare of the American people, for example, the
Chinese miracle never would have occurred. The feckless American ruling
class cannot help China transition to a domestic demand driven economy.

The bigger question with regards to China and this current financial
crisis is can the Western financial model survive the Chinese
transition. For the last thirty years the corrupt Western ruling class
has preserved itself like all corrupt ruling classes have done and that
is with bread and circuses. The Chinese economic miracle has kept
inflation down and money printing up. Cheap goods from China have been
an essential part of maintaining stability in the West.

Inflation is already becoming a problem in America. In most parts of the
economy, the food markets are plagued with supply chain problems and
rising prices. Then there are labor market problems, some of which were
created by the Covid panic, but others are the result of demographics.
Those Baby Boomers taking early retirement due to the Covid panic are
not going to be replaced by the magical people that we see on television
shows and commercials.

Of course, the great retirement boom that is just started in the US will
put massive strain on programs like Social Security and Medicare. Those
programs represent trillions in debt that can never be paid in current
dollars. Medicare is now projected to run out of cash in ten years.
Social Security has been insolvent for a long time now, based on
generally accepted accounting practices. Its assets were spent years ago
by the government, leaving it with worthless IOU’s.

[People](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/evergrande-suspends-trading-all-bonds)
are pointing to the current crisis in China as a replay of the Lehman
debacle 13 years ago, but in reality, it is a continuation of it.
Starting in the 1980’s, the people actually in charge of the world began
to transition the global economy away from an asset based system to a
credit based system. The great debt explosion that ensued took many
forms and the rise of China was one aspect. Without the massive growth
in global debt, China’s growth would have been impossible.

The thing with debt is that it has to eventually be repaid. That means
there is a hard limit to the amount of debt that can be generated. A
system based on the assumption that debt can expand forever will
naturally end in a crisis when that that assumption runs into the
reality of the debt limit. In this regard, Lehman, the mortgage crisis
and now the Evergrande crisis should be seen as warning tremors. One day
soon there will be no way to paper over one of these crises.

Step back and look at what has happened over the last half century and
what you see is an effort to mitigate the demographic decline of the
West. The reason China was so attractive to the West is she was full of
young people. China’s utility to the West is in decline because she is
rapidly getting old. The massively complex system that is the Western
financial modern is just a way to turn the youth of other societies into
cash for the Western welfare state. Their vigor is our safety net.

The trouble is the system drains the vitality of all those exposed to
it. Japan was the first example of a formerly fecund society drained of
its youth and vitality by exposure to the Western economic model. Korea
soon followed. Now we see all of the same signs in China as she nears
the end of her economic cycle. The only place left with lots of young
people is Africa, but even the scheming of Western elites will never be
enough to conquer the dark continent in this way.

In this context, what is happening in China is a sign that the system of
endless credit expansion is really the implementation of a system
that converts civilizational vigor into cash for a tiny minority. The
natural limit on the expansion of credit is set by the limit of young
people available to be consumed. China’s future was written in her one
child policy and ultimately that would set the end times for the West.
Once we run out of kids to convert to credit, the plates stop spinning.
