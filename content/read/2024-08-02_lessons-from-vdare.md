The show is a bit rambling today as I was pressed for time due to the
day job, but the topic is a good one. Failure is always a better teacher
than success, so the failure of VDare has some good lessons for us. I
say failure in that it lost the fight with the oogily-googily people in
the state of New York. It had a twenty-five-year run and helped make
immigration a central issue.

Probably the most important lesson to come out of the VDare story is
that the old America that operated by rules is gone. If you want to join
the fight, the first thing you need to understand is we no longer live
in a rules-based society. The bad guys talk about the rules, but that is
because they change the rules to fit their needs. They want you to
follow their rules, while they do what they want.

That is probably the biggest psychological barrier for people. You see
it with the young guys who think they are the forefront of radical. In
reality they are Zoomer-Boomers, young guys who think they can roll back
the clock to the time when the people they criticize were their age.
They still think they can vote their way out of this mess and back to
the old America of their grandparents.

That America is gone and it is never coming back. You see that with
VDare. The people who lawfared them out of existence had no place in old
America, other than sweeping floors, but in new America they set the
rules. Once you reach the point where such people have access to power,
the rules-based society is finished. In fact, society is finished and
waiting for the death blow.
