To the Western ear, the phrase “closed society” brings to mind hermit
kingdoms like North Korea or totalitarian societies like the old Soviet
Union. That is because the ideology of the American empire is the open
society. The open society is tolerant and open to minorities while the
closed society is intolerant. The former is always good while the latter
is always bad, very very bad.

The open society is not the norm for human organization. In fact, the
very idea of human organization requires both discrimination and
intolerance. All human organizations must have rules to determine who is
outside the group, who is inside the group and how this is enforced. An
organization where anyone can come or go as they please is just an ad
hoc mob, not an organization.

Therein lies the debilitating contradiction in the open society. If the
goal is a society where all opinions are tolerated and given a fair
hearing, it means tolerating ideas that run counter to the open society
ideal. This is where Karl Popper’s famous phrase, “the paradox of
tolerance”, comes into the conversation. In order to maintain the
tolerant society, you must be intolerant of intolerance.

Of course, this is an unresolvable paradox, which is why our open and
tolerant society increasing looks like a theocracy. It turns out that
diversity is the bane of human organization because it multiplies the
number of people who must be coerced in order to maintain the illusion
of consensus. America is looking like a prison yard run by clerics
because that is the only way to govern an open society.

It is a very big topic, but the show this week takes a swim in the
shallow end of the pool, starting with George Soros and a little bit of
Karl Popper. Soros deserves at least one show of his own, as he is one
of the most consequential men of the late 20th century and now the first
part of the 21st century. Perhaps a show on Yuri Slezkine’s <a

exploring the life of George Soros.
