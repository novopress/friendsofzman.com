------------------------------------------------------------------------

In ordinary times in ordinary countries, the prospect of a vaccine for
even a nuisance ailment like the Chicken Pox would be welcome news.
After all, one measure of society is the technology to improve human
health. In a technologically advanced society, members not only live
longer, the quality of life is better. An extra 20 years as a feeble old
man is not exactly a reward for a life well-lived. Therefore, the
promise of a Covid-19 vaccine next year should be welcome news.

As with everything else, it seems, the news of a possible vaccine just
reveals how deranged and bizarre life has become in the West. The
majority of Americans are highly skeptical of the vaccine. If people
were honest, you would find large majorities unwilling to take the
vaccine at all. Even in the medical professions, where faith in their
own skill is beyond reality, close to half distrust the vaccine. It does
not help that the rulers feel the need wrap the vaccine question in
[their racial
madness](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/racial-disparities-create-obstacles-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-n1249627).

That is the first gate in the vaccine story. Since few people have the
knowledge or aptitude to assess the risk involved in a medical
treatment, it comes down to how much they trust their doctor, the drug
companies and the system. If your doctor has always been prudent and
reliable, then you trust his judgement. If your doctor has an
unpronounceable name and looks a lot like the guy working at the
convenience store, you are less likely to trust his judgement.

In the case of the vaccine, there is no reason at all to trust the
government. They have simply lied too often about too many aspects of
this virus. Compounding it is their communications organs have been
staffed by demented sociopaths who lie for the sheer pleasure of it. The
only way anyone we could trust the media is if they are the first to be
inoculated. Even then, it would probably be a fake vaccine, so we would
need some way to ensure they are getting the real jab and not a fake.

This is why the vaccine will be mandatory. Another aspect of liberal
democracy is the rulers respond to well-founded distrust of them with
coercion. In this case, we will be getting the Orwellian freedom passes.
In the U.S. they will have some bland bureaucratic name because our
managerial elite is functionally illiterate, but the Brits retain their
pithiness, despite it all. As a result, these new internal passports
proving you are up to date on your Covid jabs will be used to compel
compliance.

What does this mean as a practical matter? What they are plotting is a
system where everyone is issued an innocuous looking card with a vaccine
stamp and date. When you get your booster shot, you get a new stamp with
an expiry date. Oh, you are unaware of the regular booster shots
required? You see? This is why this vaccine is a miracle. It will
require you to give Big Pharma a check several times a year. Your doctor
at Acme Hospital System Inc. will also be getting her beak wet.

If you think you can just blow this off, think again. For starters,
there will be a massive public relations campaign to shame skeptics. Old
people will be shown lining up for the jab and famous people will demand
you get the jab. Soon, private business will demand proof of the jab
before they accept you as a customer. Want to fly on a commercial
airline or ride public transport? Papers please. Want to attend a public
event like a sporting match? Papers please.

What this will become is the terms of service for citizenship. In fact,
it will probably be baked into terms of service edicts. If you want to
use Netflix you will have to prove you are up to date on your jabs. Of
course, Big Tech will be there to make this simpler with tracking
software for your now mandatory smart phone. That paper card they will
be issuing will be replaced with an app for your phone that will be
required if you want to function like what passes as a normal adult.

If this sounds a lot like fascism, you would be right. This idea vexes
the anti-Semites and neo-Nazis, because they demand fascism only mean
cool uniforms and camps for people they don’t like. In this age, it will
mean dreary clothing styles and camps for the people the managerial
class does not like. It’s also going to mean the implementation of
technology to control every movement of the population. You cannot
organize a proper resistance if you cannot organize at all.

One novel aspect of managerial fascism is the promotion of cranks and
kooks to discredit legitimate opposition. Over the next six months, the
media will promote kooks insisting that the vaccine is a mind control
devise or that it alters your DNA in order to make you docile and
compliant. These paranoids will be promoted, because most people will
dismiss them. This tarnishes all resistance to the new regime. It is a
tool of managerial fascism that works every time.

What the Covid-19 panic has revealed, and continues to reveal, is the
managerial elite has no respect for things like the rule of law,
individual liberty or any of the other foundation items of consensual
government. To protect democracy, they will rig the election process. To
keep us free they will strip us of our rights. In the name of inclusion
and diversity they will exclude anyone who disagrees. What we are seeing
is that the real plague on our society is the ruling class.

but it has a mild flavor. It’s autumn here in Lagos, so it is my daily
beverage now.
