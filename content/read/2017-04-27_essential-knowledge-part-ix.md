A liberal education has always meant a deep knowledge of cultural
history, which inevitably meant art and literature. Sadly, the
humanities have taken a beating from the Cult-Marx crusaders in the last
half century. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Critical Theory</a> and its
various off-shoots have, as one would expect from the Germans, reduced
art and literature to rubble. Just look at the state of poetry. It has
been reduced to displays of childish vanity at scream sessions. You find
more culturally enriching rhymes on a rest room wall.

The good news is it is easy to bypass the lunatics and go right to the
primary texts, which are often available for a song as ebooks. The
literary canon is enormous so we’ll focus on the English portion for
now. A modern educated man in the English speaking world has to have a
broad knowledge of English (and American) literature, but he should also
be familiar with the great works of the West in general. There are good
translations of the classics from every Western language so you can read
Tolstoy without knowing Russian.

Working forward from the deep dark past, the first “great works” of the
English literature are
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beowulf-Signet-Classics/dp/0451530969/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beowulf</a>, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Canterbury-Tales-Geoffrey-Chaucer/dp/0140424385/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Canterbury Tales</a>
and <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Gawain-Green-Knight-Signet-Classics/dp/0451531191/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sir Gawain and the Green
Knight</a>. The language is a little difficult for the modern reader,
but not impenetrable. Something more difficult, and often overlooked as
a result, is William Langland’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Piers-Plowman-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393975592/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Piers Plowman</a>. The
challenge here is threefold. One is the language and the other is the
Christianity. It’s also a social satire so you need to know a little
about the times, but that should be a motivation.

Then we come to Shakespeare The good news here is
<a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">all of his works are free</a> as the family no longer
has the copyright. There are some smart people who think The Bard is a
waste of time. The important themes from the important plays are so
baked into the culture that there’s no point in reading them in the
original. There’s some truth to that, but the people who say this
usually had a first class education. It’s not like you’re going to lose
IQ points by taking the time to read some of the great works of English
literature.

That said, Shakespeare had some clunkers too. From the comedies, I’d
recommend *The Merchant of Venice*, especially for the alt-right reader,
*A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, *Taming of the Shrew and Winter’s Tale*.
From the histories, *Henry IV*, *Henry V*, *Henry VIII* and *Richard
III* should be enough. Then read all of the tragedies. You can probably
skip *Titus Andronicus* and *Timon of Athens*. All, of these are
available on video and it is a good idea to see an actual production,
even if it is on video.

This is a good time to talk about poetry.
<a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Poetry/sonnets.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shakespeare’s sonnets</a> are
worth reading as an excellent introduction of English verse. And no,
reading poetry will not make you gay or Mexican. Similarly, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-English-Poems-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140422099/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Donne</a> is one of the
giants of English poetry, but I never found his work all that
interesting. Instead, I’d read <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Lives-Eminent-English-Observations-Poetry/dp/1406796204/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samuel Johnson’s discussion of
Donne and other prominent poets</a>. Finally, Edmund Spenser’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Faerie-Queene-Edmund-Spenser/dp/0140422072/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Faerie Queene</a> is a
must read and it is pretty good. If you like Game of Thrones you’ll like
this.

In a previous one of these posts, I recommended
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Thomas-More/dp/1545480052/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Utopia by Thomas Moore</a>.
Another classic from this period is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Atlantis-Francis-Bacon/dp/1603863362/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Atlantis</a> by Francis
Bacon. I won’t say it is good, but it is short. There’s also *The Isle
of Pines*, which is similar and considered the inspiration
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robinson Crusoe</a>. You can
get <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Early-Modern-Utopias-Atlantis/dp/0199537992/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all three</a> in one
book! Something better from this period is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Morte-DArthur-Death-Arthur-Volumes-ebook/dp/B00C4XV0ZU/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Morte D’Arthur</a> by Thomas
Malory. This was one of my favorites as a kid. The quest for the grail
is one of the most influential themes in English literature.

The first work of fiction to be considered a novel is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilgrims-Progress-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486426750/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Pilgrim’s Progress</a>, by
John Bunyan. It is a Christian allegory, which probably sounds awful,
but the fact that it has never been out of print since the 17th century
means it is worth reading. Also in the realm of Christian literature
is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Lost-Penguin-Classics-Milton/dp/0140424393/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paradise Lost</a> by John
Milton. Everyone has their list of essential books that an educated man
should read. Every one of those lists contains Milton, because it
arguably defined the English speaking world’s relationship to
Christianity.

Finally, to sew up this post on literature, and yes there will be
several more, I’m going to suggest something a bit odd. Integral to the
English speaking world’s culture is a relationship with nature. It turns
up throughout English literature and in American classics like
Huckleberry Finn. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Compleat-Angler-Izaak-Walton/dp/0486431878/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Complete Angler</a> by
Isaac Walton is a book about fishing that holds up today, but it is also
a book about the peaceful enjoyment of nature. Even if you are afraid of
the outdoors, an appreciation of man’s relationship to nature is
essential.
