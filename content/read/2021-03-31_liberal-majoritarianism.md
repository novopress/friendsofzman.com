The truth is like a body. No matter how clever you are in trying to
conceal it from view, it eventually turns up. One truth that keeps
turning up despite great efforts to bury it is that humans are naturally
hierarchical. Another is that in any human organization, someone has to
be in charge. This is the body that liberal democracy desperately tries
to conceal, but it keeps popping into public view. The result is the
people in charge spend an enormous amount of their time trying to rebury
the body.

Democracy, of course, is majority rule. Liberal democracy, in theory, is
majority rule within a framework of principles, like equality before the
law, separation of powers and human rights. A proposition is put forward
and it carries the day if fifty percent plus one supports it. Its
rightness is therefore determined by the majority, not by some intrinsic
quality it possesses. The majority is the legitimizing authority in a
democracy of any sort, including a liberal democracy.

This is an important defect. Since it is universally true that humans
are naturally hierarchical and every society has someone in charge, it
means the ruling class is the result of natural factors. In other words,
the most important part of a human society exists outside the
legitimizing power of majority rule. Instead of invalidating the idea of
truth being the result of popularity, liberal democracy flips things
around and demands that the majority, real or imagined, grants
legitimacy to the rulers.

It is a good example of the immutability of belief. When a person or a
society comes to believe something about itself, reality is willed in
support of that belief. That which confirms the belief is held up as
proof, while that which contradicts the belief is ignored or disputed.
It is why a disbeliever is always the prey for believers. The
destruction of the disbeliever not only validates the belief. It
validates the believer. This is why democracy breed fanatics operating
in the name of the public.

This great conflict in liberal democracy spins up over time into the
frenzy we are seeing unfold in front us. The people in charge need the
validation of the majority to bestow legitimacy on their position. It is
why they go berserk whenever they lose an election or fail to get their
way in a public policy fight. On the one hand, it is a threat to their
image as the will of the people. On the other hand, it means there are
enemies of democracy that must be hunted down and defeated.

The logical end point for one man rule is that the king, the pharaoh, or
the emperor eventually comes to think of himself as the embodiment of
the people. He is the physical manifestation of the people, but also
their moral purpose. The king becomes a god and is therefore
self-validating. In liberal democracy, the ruling class comes to think
of themselves as the embodiment of the public will. They exist because
the majority created them, and their existence is validation of the
public will.

This was clear after the last two elections. When Trump won, the ruling
elite was compelled, it was their moral duty, to get rid of him at any
cost. He was a threat to “our democracy” because he was viewed as a
repudiation of the elite. They had a moral duty to defend democracy from
him. On the other hand, the manufactured majority for Joe Biden, with
all of its absurdity, quickly became a point of public morality. The
elite demanded their opponents publicly admit it was a legitimate
election.

This is why people are sent by their employers to reeducation camps to
learn the latest social fads. It is not enough to comply with these
edicts. People silently tolerating in public the edicts of the rulers
could be privately rejecting them. Since those edicts are by default the
will of the people, it means there could be millions of silent enemies
lurking in their homes and offices. The only way to make democracy safe
from these silent enemies is to root out dissent.

It also seems that the hunt for dissenters provides a useful distraction
for the people in charge, allowing them to pose as part of the mob. Note
how the most powerful people in our liberal democracy carry on as
victims. By playing the role of David, while being Goliath, they hide
from themselves the realty of their position. Instead of being at the
top of the social hierarchy, with all it entails, they see themselves as
the guys at the front of the mob, chasing off the enemies.

As with communism, the civic religion that evolves to perpetuate the
falsehoods of the system quickly becomes a delusion the ruling elite
needs to perpetuate among themselves in order to carry out their role.
The rulers of a liberal democracy come to see a natural majority for
everything they do. Whether that majority exists or is the product of
imagination is immaterial. They believe it does exist or that it would
exist if the enemies of democracy were not preventing it.

We are at the point in liberal democracy where the majority is the
source of all truth and the arbiter of morality. When no majority
exists, one is manufactured through propaganda or coercion. If that
fails, then one is simply invented. Since no source of legitimacy exists
outside the majority, liberal democracy starts to look a lot like every
other totalitarian system. Everything in the public will, nothing
outside the public will and nothing against the public will.
