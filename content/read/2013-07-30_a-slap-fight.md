Governor Tiny has the chattering classes talking about the brewing fight
between “libertarians” and “conservatives” over the direction of the
GOP.  <a href="http://pjmedia.com/blog/a-fight-that-had-to-happen/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s a representative example of the
coverage</a>. The writer labels one side the establishment and the other
insurgents, but calling the GOP conservative is serious error. That’s
the official line, but that’s gratuitous nonsense. America’s ruling
elites range from fanatically left-wing to mildly liberal. They agree on
everything, except how fast to proceed. That’s the only dispute.

The Republicans are mostly a governor on the Democrats. The Democrats
want to rush off and implement their latest fads right now, while the
Republicans try to slow them down, but largely supporting them. These
“cooler heads” used to be in the Democrat party, but they were chased
off in the 1990’s. In every fight, the establishment types find some
reason to give into the Left on most of what they want. Not everyone is
happy with this arrangement.  As Michael Walsh noted on NRO, it is a <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">good time to have the fight</a>.

It makes for some good theater, but nothing changes until there is
catastrophe. That’s why every epoch is book-ended by violent conflicts
and great turmoil. The people in charge like the ways things are, so
they will not fundamentally alter anything. It’s only when the system
becomes unstable or untenable that change can happen. The old guard will
not leave quietly, so that means a new guard will have to force them
out. That’s the best case scenario, but that’s not the way to bet. What
comes next is not going to be pleasant.
