rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> about world
drunkenness is interesting. Immigrant countries don’t tell us a whole
lot with a survey like this, but the old world offers some useful
insights. Those screaming about scientific racism love talking about
this sort of stuff, never understanding that it undermines their
charges, making them look foolish. You can’t explain a map like this
with culture alone. It gets worse when those ethnic patters hold for
people in North America. From the article:

*People in the UK are among the most prolific drinkers in the world,
according to a report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO).*

*Britons over the age of 15 on average drink 11.6 litres of pure alcohol
a year, according to the <a
href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/alcohol-related-deaths-prevention/en/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Global status report on
alcohol and health 2014”</a>.*

*The report provides country profiles for alcohol consumption in the 194
WHO member states, looking at the resulting impact on public health and
policy responses.*

*And it reveals that the harmful use of alcohol causes 3.3 million
deaths a year worldwide.*

*Europe is the region with the highest consumption of alcohol per
person, making up the entire top 10.*

*Belarus takes the top spot, with people on average drinking 17.5 litres
of pure alcohol a year, followed by the Republic of Moldova where the
figure is 16.8 litres.*

*Australia and Canada also have high levels of alcohol consumption, with
people on average drinking 12.2 and 10.2 litres a year respectively.*

*In the United States the figure is marginally lower at 9.2 litres.*

*But in northern Africa and the Middle East, the average figure is less
than 2.5 litres of alcohol per person, with many countries having
figures below one litre.*

When analyzing the stand-off with Russia over Ukraine, it may be useful
to remember this map. There are many difference between east and West
and they don’t stop at the neck line or the bar bill. Russia is not
Western, but it is not Asian either. It is the great transition and that
shapes the Russian worldview. They look at Ukraine in a very different
way that the sorts of people infesting the State Department.
