The point at which the Roman Republic moved from republic to empire is
generally placed at the point when the Senate granted Octavian almost
unlimited power and he adopted the title Augustus. Some historians argue
it was when Caesar crossed the Rubicon or when Octavian defeated Antony
at Actium. The implication is that once the transition was started,
there was no turning back. The more useful analysis is to think of it as
a process, with roots in the Republic, that evolved to the point where
dictatorship was inevitable.

The die was most likely cast when the Republic began to compromise its
own rules for limiting and distributing power. The system they had
created was a reflection of the tribal realities of the early republic.
In order to keep any one family from gaining too much power, they
systematically limited the time anyone served in office. The system also
forced an apprenticeship on those who went into public life. This had
the benefit of making public men buy into the system. Therefore they
were willing to defend it.

That meant the system had a policing mechanism to sort out enemies
before they could cause trouble. An ambitious young man could not skip
any steps on his way up the ladder, so once he got up the ladder, he was
not agreeing to any changes in the process. Defending the system was a
way to defend one’s prerogatives, but also a way to defend the system
from lunatics. Verpus Maximus may be smart and talented, but he was not
only going to wait his turn, he was going to do all the jobs necessary
to prove his worth.

This system started to break down with the rivalry of Sulla and Marius.
Sulla was the first man to hold the office of consul twice. He also got
away with marching an army on Rome itself, in order to defeat his rival,
Marius. Both of these acts were supposed to be disqualifying, but
exceptions were made for expediency. Sulla sided with the Senate so the
Senate bent the rules to serve themselves. A good case can be made that
this is the point when it was all over for the Republic.

It was just a matter of time before someone used Sulla as a *precedent*.

It is a good lesson to keep in mind as the politicians in the Imperial
Capital wrangle over what could be <a

The political class chased Nixon out of town for *talking* about the use
of the FBI and CIA as weapons against political opponents. The rule in
politics has been that the use of the IRS or the intelligence agencies
was expressly prohibited. There could be no exceptions for obvious
reasons, as it would give these bureaucracies dangerous power. That was
the lesson of Hoover. If the CIA or IRS are allowed to use their powers
to gather dirt on elected officials, then they can control elected
officials. That’s the end of democracy.

Of course, there’s another reason to take certain weapons off the table
in politics. That’s self preservation. In prior ages, where the winners
had the losers killed, the challengers would always have as their goal,
the death of the current ruler. That prompted the ruler to get ahead of
the curve and have any potential challengers killed, before they could
be any trouble. This was Stalin’s game and he just about gutted the the
intellectual and political elite of Russia in the process. They still
have not recovered from it.

That’s what makes this so dangerous. It’s now clear what happened. The
Obama people started spying on Trump once he had the nomination or
perhaps even earlier. They may have started earlier with an eye on
helping the Republicans knock him off in the primary, but that’s not
clear. They figured that Clinton was a lock so they were not careful
about covering their tracks. The Clinton people are as dirty as it gets
so they were not going to be ratting on anyone over it. If anything,
they would expand on it.

This is where the Russian hacking story comes into the picture. Once
disaster struck and Team Obama realized they had a problem, they needed
cover, so they started with the Russian hacking nonsense. They would
then claim that it was all an accident and they were just trying to
prevent Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale from attacking our democracy!
It’s also why <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/obama-expanding-nsa-powers/513041/"
target="_blank">Obama signed a retroactive Executive Order</a> giving
cover to the intel agencies for their domestic spying activities. They
were creating a cover story.

The complication is that it appears that at least one person has
perjured himself over this and that one person is FBI Director Comey.
There’s no way to square his testimony with these new revelations. The
best he can do is split hairs and claim he was not part of the spying
effort. Of course, there’s no way to touch him as he runs the FBI. In
fact, there’s no way to investigate any of the intelligence
organizations. This is the point where many of the robot historians of
the future will say the American political class murdered itself.

Unless there is some will to address it, and that’s highly unlikely, we
now have a new normal where highly politicized intelligence agencies are
used by both sides to discredit one another and discredit any attempts
to reform the system. It’s no longer a game of rules. It is a zero sum
 game of power and that cycle only ends one way, with someone marching
their army on the capital and taking control. As with Rome, whoever
emerges as the dictator will not have murdered the system. The system
will have murdered itself.
