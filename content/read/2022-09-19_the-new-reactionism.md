Since roughly the French Revolution, the dynamic of Western politics has
been the conflict between radical forces and reactionary forces. The
radicals, armed with liberal ideas, seek to change social arrangements
for the better. The reactionaries, fearing what change could bring,
instinctively oppose these changes. This description is entirely
self-serving, which is why “radicals” love it. The point is to frame
politics as good guys, the radicals, versus bad guys, the reactionaries.

In this age it does not hold up as a logical construct because the
people waving the flag of radicalism control the institutions. The
so-called reactionaries cannot be working from fear for what change will
do to their social power, when they have no political or social power to
conserve. This does not stop the radicals from pretending their victims
have power, but it is a self-serving game of make believe. The people on
the receiving end of radicalism know who has the whip hand.

This is why the old Left-Right framing makes no sense. The people
claiming to be on the Right these days are not monarchists. They are not
in genuine opposition to the people on the Left. They simply prefer a
slower pace of change. The Left is certainly not opposed to
institutional power, like all prior left-wing movements. They worship
institutional power and act in defense of it. To maintain the old
framing, the dissidents are the New Left and the regime is the New
Right.

Recent events support this new framing. The election integrity protests
during the 2020 cycle looked like every other protest against power. The
people in control of the institutions certainly saw it that way. They
still carry on like January 6 was a failed Bastille Day or the echoes of
1848. In response, they are acting like institutional power always
reacts to threats. They are rounding up opponents, abusing the rights of
their citizens and threatening retribution.

A good example of this new reactionism is in the paranoid chanting about
threats to “our democracy” that are a feature of the current regime.
Those old enough to remember the 1980’s or even the 1990’s see this
fetish for democracy as novel. The standard response from so-called
conservatives whenever someone said America was a democracy was to
correct them and say it was a republic. Even the Left would make this
point, lamenting the lack of democracy.

All of a sudden, as if there was a secret meeting of the ruling class,
America is a democracy and that democracy is under assault. This started
in the Obama years when his backers pushed the nutty idea that white
people would oppose him strictly on the grounds that he was a black
Muslim from Africa. Even though he gained a bigger majority of the white
vote than Bush or Clinton, they persisted in this claim, saying his
opponents opposed the democratic process.

Of course, what solidified the new language was 2016. The man who won
the election based on the rules of how we conduct elections, was deemed
a threat to the process that put him in office. This is not what they
meant when they said Trump was a threat to democracy. What they meant
was that he was a threat to the established order and the people it
benefits. The word “democracy” now implies the established order and the
semi-permanent ruling elite.

This is no different from how genuine reactionaries in 18th century
Europe responded to the threat of socialism. They used the same sort of
language and they used the same sort of tactics we see today. The point
of their rhetoric was not to persuade the masses to side with the old
order, but to persuade the people running the institutions to use their
power to defeat the radicals. In other words, reactionaries do not seek
to win arguments, but rather to rally elites to wield power.

Here is an <a href="https://archive.ph/gwPCY" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">example</a> in the New York Times. David Leonhardt is
employed by the “paper of record” to inform the managerial class. His
<a href="https://archive.ph/RjorE" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">archive</a> is full of stories that would be of use to
people in power, but utterly worthless to everyone else. His job at the
media shop that serves the regime is to set the tone for other regime
outlets and to help set the priorities of the regime. Normally he
worries about how to keep the peasants fed, but this post is about
“threats to our democracy.”

The reactionary quality is clear in the first so-called threat. He
claims, “a growing movement inside one of the country’s two major
parties — the Republican Party — to refuse to accept defeat in an
election.” The New York Times literally created a bureau in 2016 to
cover the Russian collusion hoax. The point of their existence, and that
of all regime outlets, was to undermine the legitimacy of the Trump
presidency. The word “hypocrisy” does not scratch the surface here.

The second threat somehow manages to be even more contradictory. “The
second threat to democracy is chronic but also growing: The power to set
government policy is becoming increasingly disconnected from public
opinion.” On the surface this sounds fine, but he does not mean public
opinion as in elections. He means the perception of public opinion as
held by the people in power. His example is the recent Dobbs case, which
he claims runs counter to public opinion.

When you interpret “democracy” to mean “established order” when used by
regime elements, this makes sense. There is a Burkean flexibility in
defense of the status quo in the face of public discontent. That is,
they acknowledge the rules and the rights of the people, but only as far
as they are reasonable. If the rules or the exercise of rights threaten
the established order, then they are unreasonable. You can have whatever
political system you like as long the people in charge agree

This new reactionism is what lies behind the weird social fads and
assaults on decency that have become common. The claim by the people
behind these things is that they are trying to subvert the old order,
when in reality they are useful idiots. Their job is to keep the people
occupied with these controversies so they do not start thinking about
why their schools are a mess or why two incomes are no longer enough to
provide a middle-class life. it is defensive distraction.

Historically, reactionism is something that flowers at the end of an age
when the old order feels threatened. That is one way to read the current
crisis. The people leading the charge to defend “our democracy” are
decrepit old people who represent the dire warnings about managerialism.
They are mediocrities raised up to the top of the social order, yet
fully aware of their mediocrity. It is a system now dominated by highly
insecure managers paranoid about everyone around them.

The reason reactionism turns up at the end phase of a regime is that it
often works fairly well to blunt the forces of change. Reaction is what
drove the response to Napoleon, eventually leading to the restoration in
France. Reaction held back the tides of socialism in the 19th century
into the 20th century. Reaction is what defeated Trump and put Joe Biden
in the White House. Fear is a powerful motivator and powerful people in
fear for their position make for a powerful force.
