Steve Sailer famously quipped that political correctness is a war on
noticing. By which he meant noticing human diversity. Initially, this
started out as a war on noticing bad things about groups of people. Then
it slowly evolved into prohibitions on noticing general differences
between groups of people. After all, it was said, all people evolved
from the same source. This process has continued to the point where it
is now forbidden to notice anything about people.

A good example is in
<a href="https://twitter.com/JAMA_current/status/1304102350857154567"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this tweet</a> from the
Journal of the American Medical Association, which is the premier
peer-reviewed medical journal in the United States. Since the start of
the Covid panic, it has been reported that blacks are more likely to
contract the virus and more likely to need medical attention. This
observation has been politicized, of course, but it is also a clue as to
how the virus works. Naturally, there is money to find out why and
scientific interest in the subject.

Given the racial unrest that has been manufactured by the nation’s
elites, one would think that extra resources flowing into the care of
black people would be celebrated by the great and good. If we are
remaking movies, television shows and commercials to feature all black
people, why not remake medical research too? As you can see from the
replies, dogma trumps everything. While racism is a real thing,
according to the one true faith, race is imaginary and racist.

The very first reply is emblematic of the modern age. It is from someone
calling herself Rose Marie Leslie, MD. She claims to be a medical
resident. On her twitter profile she lists the following: Top 20 docs on
Social Media, Tiktok, Health Ed, Social Justice, Black Lives Matter and
Repro Health. As if that was not enough self-parody, her comment was
“Why are you spending the time and money on these studies instead of
spending the time and money on fighting racism?”

Just below that comment we have a comment from someone calling herself
Ramla N. Kasozi MD, MPH. They do not list their pronouns, so we must
assume it is female, based on the profile picture. Mx. Ramla wrote, “An
example of Biological Racism as discussed by Dr.@haw95 in her book
‘Medical Apartheid’ and Dr.@DrIbram book ‘How To Be Antiracist’.”
According to Mx. Kasozi, noticing that Covid infects blacks more than
whites is a form of racist experimentation.

In such a cornucopia of lunacy, it is hard to select the most bizarre,
but the replies from someone calling herself Karen Gibbins, MD are a
good nominee. Her first comment in the thread was, “Attributing genetic
variants to race (which is socially constructed) is racist. Stop.” She
then quickly replied to herself with, “And systemic racism is why there
is why BIPOC are disproportionately harmed by COVID-19.” Racism, the
cause of and cure for everything that is wrong in the world.

While these sorts of public displays of insanity are amusing, the
salient issue here is the insane people highlighted are doctors. They
work with real human patients in real medical settings. That means
people are trusting doctors who think biology is imaginary and human
diversity is a conspiracy. Given the histrionics, it is not implausible
to think that a few of these people think sex is a social construct.
Imagine being treated by someone who thinks your penis is a figment of
your imagination.

The other salient issue is the panic that radiates from the replies. The
mere mention of disconfirming data causes these people to panic. Their
complaint is not about factual accuracy or medical efficacy. These are
people deeply committed to a primitive animistic religion. This religion
tells them that the world is controlled by various spirit forces, good
and evil, engaged in a great struggle. Most important, their role in
this great struggle is to fight the evil spirits.

Their commitment to this new faith is so complete that in the name of
fighting racism, they would happily let blacks die from disease. If the
price of helping the people they claim to care so much about is the
acknowledgment that nature does not distribute her gifts equally among
people or groups of people, then they are perfectly willing to see those
people suffer and die. In fact, the suffering is a confirmation that
these evil spirits are real and therefor the struggle is real.

The striking thing about this new faith is it is so primitive. These
people are a very long way from the Christian looking up from Scripture
and contemplating how God set the world in motion. These are people
cowering in the darkness, deathly afraid to know what lies behind the
movements of the world. Theirs is a world haunted by dread and
foreboding, not a world of miracles to be explored. This is the great
darkness that is settling on this age, the new dark age of the West.
