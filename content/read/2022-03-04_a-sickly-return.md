One of the things I forgot about travel is that I always pick up a bit
of the plague whenever I spend time in airports. Back when I was
traveling on a regular basis, my immune system was used to it, so it was
a day or two of a very mild cold the week after I got back from a trip.
Having been off the road for two years, my white blood cells are out of
practice or perhaps my memory cells have forgotten. Regardless, I picked
up a nice case of Ebola on the trip to Florida.

I rarely get colds or the flu. I think the last time I got the flu was
in the 1990’s, but the best I can say is it was a long time ago. Colds
are a different thing. Like everyone I get those from time to time, but
for me it is always very mild. Mostly just some sneezing and the
sniffles for a couple of days. Like the flu, the last time I got a
serious cold that had me struggling was so long ago I cannot recall the
date. I remember Bush was the president, so a little less than twenty
years ago.

That said, I did have the man’s version of Covid back when this started.
That was not particularly impressive, as plagues go. It was pretty much
like having a bad cold with a fever for roughly a week. Three days of
getting sick, three days of being sick then three days of getting over
being sick. This softer, girly version is much milder, but it seems to
stick around for longer. The worst part is it has messed with my sleep.
I am more tired right now than legitimately sick.

That is why I did a one-take show this week. I had something more
elaborate planned, but I am running low on energy. It is also why the
show is a bit rambling. I started to lose the plot in the second half of
the show. It was also a chance to clear up some questions about the two
big topics of the week and clear out the items in the mailbox. I have a
two hour show I have been plotting, so maybe that will next week,
assuming the plague lifts and I am fit for recording again.
