It is too soon to know if the young woman in Texas will die from Ebola
so we can’t pin her death on anyone just yet. We can blame our
government for letting disease riddled savages into our country, at
least one of whom had Ebola and infected this young women. There’s a
chance she could be <a

*The Texan nurse diagnosed with Ebola has received a blood transfusion
from survivor Dr Kent Brantly, reports claim.*

*It is the third time Dr Brantly has donated blood to Ebola victims
after medics discovered he had the same blood type as previous patient
Dr Nick Sacra and NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who is still being
treated.*

*<span id="ext-gen152">Incredibly, nurse Nina Pham, 26, has also matched
with Brantly and today received a transfusion of his blood in a move
that doctors believe could save her life. </span>*

*Pham has been in quarantine since Friday after catching the disease
from ‘patient zero’ Thomas Eric Duncan – the man who brought the deadly
virus to America.*

*Brantly is believed to have traveled to Texas Health Presbyterian
Hospital, where Pham worked, to make the donation on Sunday night.*

*Today, Pham’s condition was described as ‘clinically stable’.*

At the end of the Carter years, a lot of sensible people thought we were
finished as a country. The people in charge simply had no idea how to
turn the thing around and keep us from collapsing into a heap like
Europe. But, the people were still in good shape. When someone with a
clue came along, he was put in charge and the decline was arrested.
Reagan was not perfect, but he did not have a bunch of crazy ideas in
his head about the country and his countrymen. As a result, he
championed sensible public policy that left the American people free to
work out the rest.

Today, we are once again run by people with crazy ideas in their heads
and the country is headed down the tubes. The difference now is we have
millions of savages poring over the borders. Those savages are carrying
disease and pestilence. Ebola is a disease you get from eating bats or
improperly handling the infected corpses of the dead – IN AFRICA!
There’s no damned reason for anyone in America to get the disease. It’s
time to build the scaffold.
