One of the many frustrations of people in outsider politics is that the
people inside conventional politics, especially in the conservative
wing, never respond to what is going on outside of Washington. After
every election, regardless of the result, they continue doing what they
were doing before the election. We saw this most clearly after 2016
where Conservative Inc rallied against Trump.

The reason for that is conservatism is not just an institution or even a
collection of institutions, but rather an ecosystem that provides total
care for the people who are allowed to take up a place in it. If you
manage to slither inside one of the institutions, you no longer live
outside of your political existence. To the contrary, your entire life
is now defined by your place in the political ecosystem.

The reason for that is the enormity of institutional conservatism. What
it lacks in popular support it more than makes up for in financial
support. That money is used to build a network of institutions that are
linked together to provide a lifestyle to the people inside them that
they could never achieve in the dreaded private sector. As a result,
everyone inside is deeply loyal to the system.

That is the show this week. In order to provide some perspective on the
size and scale of the Conservative Industrial Complex, I go through the
leading organizations and explain their size and scope. This is just a
sample as the system is composed of hundreds of nodes and is well over a
billion dollars in revenue, before you start looking at their purely
political activities.
