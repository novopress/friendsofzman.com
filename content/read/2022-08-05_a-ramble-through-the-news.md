It is that time of year when we begin the slow turn into fall. In most
places it is still a million degrees, but there are little signs here
and there. The sun sets a bit earlier every night and it is a few
degrees cooler in the morning. The big sign is the slow return of
political lunacy in the news. The chattering skulls, influencers and
news makers are still on holiday but they are plotting their return next
month.

The big news this week was the primaries in key states. The amusing bit
was how the crazies went nuts over the Kansas abortion referendum. They
do not have much to celebrate so it makes sense to make a huge deal over
one small win, but it was amusing to see the deluge of stories in the
media. Sprinkled in were some reassuring tales of obscure MAGA
candidates losing local elections.

That is the real story. Trump endorsed candidates seem to be doing very
well, despite general Trump fatigue and the efforts of his party. Many
of these candidates are fakers and liars, but some are genuinely ticked
off people. The woman running for governor in Arizona appears to a
polished up Marjorie Taylor Green. Blake Masters, also running in
Arizona, is as close to one of us as you can get.

That is what does not show up in these news stories. People are probably
more angry and restless right now than during the leadup to the 2016
election. The antiwhite pogroms have radically changed attitudes. Normie
seeing ads featuring everyone but white people, unless it is a white
woman with a black man, has had reality jammed in his face for a couple
of years now and he does not like it.

Because there is no acceptable outlet for these feelings, except by
watching Tucker Carlson at night, the result is a seething anger. Of
course, the reckless antics of the geezers running Washington just adds
to the unhappiness. The primaries have elevated a lot of unconventional
candidates, despite the party efforts. The general could turn out to be
a red wave similar to 2010.

So far, regime media has not noticed this. They are still carrying on
like it is the runup to the 2020 election. As we get closer to autumn it
will be interesting to see if the narratives shift in preparation for
the November election. Maybe they snuff out Biden to create a
distraction. Maybe China finally snaps and we have a war. Maybe the
regime remains on this glide path until it slams into reality in
November.
