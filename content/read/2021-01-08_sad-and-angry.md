Popular revolts in occidental countries tend to build slowly and then
have a series of tremors before there is some clarifying event. The
reason for this is people unhappy with their conditions tend to look for
simple answers first and then apply themselves to getting relief from
the system within the rules. They identify the problem or what they
think is the problem and then go to the people in charge with it. In
modern liberal democracy it means engaging in the political process.

Then either by serendipity or a confluence of events driven by various
actors, there is an event that causes the scales to fall from the eyes
of the people. In isolation, the attack on the Bastille was a non-event,
but in the context of the historical moment, it was revelatory. The 1980
strike at Gdańsk Shipyard in Poland is a more modern example of a small
event ushering in a paradigm shift. People thought one way before the
event and they thought a different way after it.

Events this week will prove to be one of those times where people
quickly went from one view of their world to another. There have been
many left-wing and wingless protests in Washington. Just a few years ago
the Left filled the Capitol with protestors over the Kavanaugh
nomination. Those come and go and they are forgotten because they have
no connection to larger trends under the surface. It is just part of the
way the inner party torments the outer party in Washington.

The storming of the Capitol opened a lot of eyes. The people in the
media demanding mass executions of Trump supporters were just six months
ago gloating over left-wing mobs burning cities. Six months ago,
official Washington was telling us the cops were a problem and now they
are demanding they open fire on protestors. When a black criminal died
in police custody, they demanded vengeance. When a white veteran is
murdered by a cop on video, they think it great fun.

This week has been clarifying, because it has confirmed what people have
been slowly realizing at a subconscious level. The manufactured outrage
of George Floyd would have passed unnoticed, if it had not been followed
by the orchestrated campaign by corporate America to promote hostility
to white people. If that had passed, then people may have forgotten
about it, but that was quickly followed by the Covid lock downs and then
the election fraud. The road to epiphany now seems clear.

Many on this side of the great divide have predicted we would end up at
this point eventually, but no one has every relished it. The events of
this week were not just an epiphany for the MAGA-hat wearing normies. It
has been an eye-opener for many on this side, as well. Unless you have
something wrong with you, you held out some small hope that the
prediction would turn out to be wrong. That hope is gone now and with it
comes a bit of sadness over the finality of it.

There’s nothing wrong with that. In a way, it is like the passing of an
old relation who has been sick for a long time. Long ago you reconciled
yourself to the inevitable and in your own way said your goodbyes. The
waiting, however, becomes part of your normal so when the time comes
there is a hole. Into it flows the remaining sadness at the finality of
it all. That’s where we are now. What comes next is getting on with the
new tribal politics of the future, free of nostalgia and sentimentality.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
