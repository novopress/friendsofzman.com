<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre"
target="_blank">Maximilian Robespierre</a> is mostly remembered as the
man responsible for the Great Terror. Progressives, of course, remember
him fondly for this. Killing enemies of the revolution is the thing they
fantasize about the most. It is why they are always trying to instigate
violence. Normal people think of him as an example of what happens when
fanatics gain power. He’s the example of the guy who started out with
good intentions, but he eventually grew mad with power and ended up
worse than what he opposed.

He was a much more complicated person than is remembered, though. For
example, he opposed the death penalty, but then championed the execution
of the king. He opposed the indiscriminate use of terror, but ended
up claiming it was the necessary tool of democracy. He defended rivals
branded as traitors, but then turned on close friends and saw them off
to the guillotine. As a result, he remains one of the more famous and
most controversial figures in the French Revolution.

The thing that was his eventual undoing was the fact that he could never
work out the limit of civic virtue. At what point was a man deemed
sufficiently virtuous? Where is the line between traitor and patriot? It
was a problem for all of the revolutionaries and a problem that has
haunted the Left ever since. Radicalism always starts as a rejection of
something. It never ends at a clearly defined point. There’s no limiting
principle. No matter how much you oppose something, there is someone
else who opposes it more.

That was the problem the revolutionaries faced when they toppled the
king. The old order was orderly, even if it was unjust. It set limits on
behavior. The new order, such as it was, had no limits as it was
entirely based on the rejection of royalty and the royalists.
Revolutionary virtue was one’s opposition to the old system and one
could ever be too opposed to the old order. At least, that was the
thinking until the members of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction"
target="_blank">National Convention figured out where it was heading</a>.

That’s the inherent problem with radicalism. It lacks a limiting
principle. Christianity, for example, solved this problem early on by
turning the problem around. The concept of sin makes virtue the
passive position. Heresy is the active state, while grace is the passive
state. As long as you did not actively commit sins against the faith,
you were sufficiently virtuous. Even though you were born with original
sin, baptism into the faith cleansed you of that sin. From there, it was
up to you to maintain it.

Political radicalism has never found anything similar and thus has been
condemned to repeat the life of Robespierre. There is not point at which
one clearly passes from the state of sin to the state of virtue.
Instead, virtue is the running from sin, which is always running after
you like a monster in a horror movie. It’s why the Left today obsesses
with <a
href="http://theweek.com/articles/490484/msnbcs-new-slogan-what-does-even-mean"
target="_blank">leaning forward</a> and looking ahead to the future.
Virtue is an active state, the act of running from the past, like a
frightened animal trying to outrun the slowest of the herd.

We’re seeing this with anti-racism. The recent Martin Luther King
holiday provided an opportunity for the members of the One True Faith to
display their piety. When the holiday was created a generation ago, it
was sufficient to say some nice things about the man and leave it at
that. Most people simply ignored it entirely. Today, you have to come
close to demanding the death of all white men or you risk being called a
racist by the Cult. The day is filled with one anti-racist after another
signalling their virtue.

target="_blank">This column</a> appeared Monday in USA Today.

> I’ll let Ta-Nehisi Coates boil it down for you. White society was not

> through the pillaging of life, liberty, labor and land.” In short,
> through three centuries of kidnapping, torture, murder and rape.
> Broken teeth, broken bones and broken spirits. Families ripped apart.
> Children taken from their parents. Men humiliated in front of their
> wives. Women brutalized within earshot of their husbands. Lash after
> bloody lash on bare backs. Then, sleep on a bare wooden floor. No
> doctor, no dentist, no nothing. Just non-stop misery with a few hymns
> on Sunday.

The whole column boils down to a blood libel. If you are white, you are
born with a sin that can never be cleansed. You are forever outside the
light of salvation. That means there is no limit to your misery, which
is why honkies, like the idiot who wrote that piece, write columns where
they condemn themselves and others for being white. There can be no
limit to how much one hates their ancestors, and therefore themselves,
as there is no outrunning the mortal sin of whiteness.

Anti-racists are the modern version of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellant"
target="_blank">Flagellants</a>. During the black plague, the allegedly
virtuous would go around whipping themselves as a form of mortification
of the flesh. Put another way, just being alive made them, and everyone
else, sinners. The willingness to destroy their own flesh was supposed
to show their rejection of sin. Initially these people were viewed by
the authorities as harmless lunatics, but then the Church eventually did
the wise thing and condemned the movement.

This is where anti-racism is right now. You cannot be anti-racist
enough. There is no limit so anyone can come along and be more
anti-racist than the current most anti-racist guy. If one is not
constantly racing to be even more pure, they risk being accused of
heresy, which in the modern age means being a racist. It is why Trump is
called a racist. It’s not just a political taunt. The lunatics of the
anti-racism movement see anyone not racing toward virtue as an enemy of
their cause.

This is the natural end of all radicalism. It is why it appeals to the
hive minded. The anti-racists would merrily round up white people and
kill them, not for any crimes they committed, but as a form of human
sacrifice. That is what the regular executions in Paris became during
the Terror. They were purification ceremonies, not punishments for the
guilty, but purity was always just one more head in the basket away.
It’s the inevitable end of all mass movements when there is no limiting
principle.

Robespierre eventually went to his demise in what we call today
the [Thermidorian
Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction "Thermidorian Reaction").
The sensible people of the revolution figured out that putting lunatics
in charge was going to get everyone killed so they did what had to be
done, which was kill the lunatics. It is a lesson that has had to be
relearned time and again since the French Revolution and one that will
have to be learned now with the anti-racists. There’s no reasoning with
them so the only solution is to eliminate them.

It raises a larger question though. How does a modern society keep these
radical lunatics from coming back with some new cause? Christianity used
to be a handy brake on this sort of thing. The overthrow of Christianity
as the transcendent moral authority has opened the nuthouse doors to
these sorts of movements. If you look at the history of the West since
the Enlightenment, it has been one blood thirsty movement after another
trying to replace Christianity as the moral authority of last resort.
