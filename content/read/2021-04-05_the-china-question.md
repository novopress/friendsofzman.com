------------------------------------------------------------------------

A popular topic among Sinophiles since the installation of Joe Biden as
president is the possibility of war with China over the status of
Taiwan. The Chinese have been obsessed with Taiwan since Mao. With the
American empire in sharp decline and the Biden regime unpopular at home
and abroad, now could be the perfect time for the Chinese to make their
move. As John Derbyshire is fond of pointing out, “Taiwan is like two
feet from China … We are eight thousand miles away.”

While there is little doubt that China could retake Taiwan whenever it
likes, the cost would be extremely high. For starters, Taiwan and the US
have been preparing for such a move for generations. Some of the most
sophisticated early warning systems on earth are installed in Taiwan
specifically keep an eye on China. There is the very strong possibility
that Taiwan has underground missile systems capable of reaching targets
on the mainland in the event of an attack by China.

Whether or not the US would actually go to war to defend Taiwan is
debatable, but that is the official position. Japan, South Korea, the
Philippines, and Australia are also technically committed to the defense
of Taiwan. An all-out assault on Taiwan could very well result in
attacks on Chinese infrastructure along the coast. It would most
certainly result in massive economic retaliation. The Chinese regime
would be forced to explain to her people why they are suddenly poor
again.

Of course, the Chinese could counter with attacks on Japan, South Korea,
the Philippines, and Australia. Her navy is the largest in the world
now, even if it lacks the forward capability of the American empire. It
could deliver attacks on her neighbors, including Hawaii. In an all-out
war, she could attack the west coast of the United States with submarine
based missiles. The point is, China is not Iraq, some pipsqueak the US
military can kick around without consequences.

That reality, however, is why such a full-blown confrontation is
unlikely. Despite what many believe, China is hooked on the dollar like
the rest of the world. She cannot afford war with the US at this time.
The reason the Chinese flooded the American election system with cash in
2020 is the Trump administration was causing real problems for the
Chinese with their trade policies. No one can be sure if the Covid
plague China unleashed was an accident, but you cannot rule it out.

The point being is that an economic war with the American empire would
be catastrophic for the Chinese economy. The usual suspects love crowing
about the Chinese economy, but her per capita GDP is $10,839. That is
down there with Costa Rica and Bulgaria. China has a lot of poor people.
The rich people she has are obligated to make sure those poor are
provided with the basics. The iron rice bowl is a real thing, and the
Chinese regime takes it very seriously.

There is also the fact that China is smart. She can take the long view
with Taiwan as she knows in a generation the American empire will be
gone. Given the physical condition of the ruling class and the mental
condition of the probable successors, the American empire will be out of
Asia in a decade. Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia all
know this and have been planning accordingly. China can just bide her
time and Taiwan will come to her, hat in hand.

There is also the possibility this happens much quicker. It is clear to
the world that Joe Biden is *non compos mentis.* Whoever is calling the
shots is not bothering to consult the White House. This is why there is
a crisis in the Ukraine. Someone from the semi-permanent ruling class
encouraged Kiev to declare her intention to retake the Crimea, which has
resulted in a stand-off with the Russians, who have no intention of
allowing Ukraine to make any moves on the Crimea.

Then there is the dispute over Nord Stream 2, the new natural gas
pipeline being built to supply western Europe. Shadowy financial
interests in the American empire have been trying to stop this project
for a long time. Biden administration figures have been dispatched to
Europe to deliver a message from those shadowy financial interests that
the Washington regime will pull out all the stops to prevent this
project. This is further undermining the credibility of the Biden
regime.

From the Chinese perspective, she has no reason to make any moves on
Taiwan, as the puppet government in Washington is unlikely to stagger on
much longer. Despite the claims by regime media, the world fully grasps
the reality of the situation. The American regime is in deep crisis. The
American empire is the sick man of the world right now and everyone is
just waiting for the inevitable. History shows that the end comes much
sooner than the patient ever expects.

The point of all this is that China has no reason to force a
confrontation with the American empire over Taiwan. Through bribery,
maneuvering and the general incompetence of the American ruling elite,
China can quietly dictate policy to the regime in Washington. If she is
patient, this reality will become clear to her neighbors in the region,
and they will peacefully detach from the American empire and align with
the Chinese empire. There is no need to fight the inevitable.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
