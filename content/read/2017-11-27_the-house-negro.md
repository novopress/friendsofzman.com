The first time I had any reason to know about Ben Shapiro was when he
appeared on the Piers Morgan show to talk guns. For those who may not
remember, CNN had imported a British popinjay to host an evening chat
show. Americans tend to associate the British accent with sophistication
and erudition, so CNN thought having a British guy read from the
Progressive catechism would lend credibility to their lineup. Morgan
quickly revealed himself to be an insufferable windbag with a British
accent and his ratings tanked.

The only time I had a reason to watch the show was after Shapiro’s
appearance and clips were floating around social media. The Boomer Cons
were out in the streets, waving their pocket Constitutions and throwing
their tricorn hats in the air. To my untrained eyes, the whole thing
looked like a setup. Everything on TV is staged, after all.

like two very bad actors reading lines prepared for them by others.
Whether or not it was on the level, it started Shapiro off on his path
to become his generation’s
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/SAFIRE-BIO.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Safire</a>.

In the age of mass media, it is hard to imagine a time when political
commentary was limited to three TV networks and the newspapers. That
meant there were very few spots for the professional pundit. Getting one
of those gigs was like hitting the lottery, except it required years of
apple polishing in the news business and politics. William Safire
figured out how to create a position in the commentariat that only he
could fill. That’s the spot for the housebroken conservative, who would
jovially defend Republicans among liberals.

When I was a kid, Safire was the only non-liberal voice on television
chat shows. I no longer recall the network or show, but after 40 minutes
of Progressive dogma, they would have Safire on, along with three
liberals, to give the other side. This was what passed for balance in
those days. It made Safire rich and famous, because he was the only guy
on television who would dare speak for the other 80% of the country.
Even by the standards of the day, he was a total cuck, but he was the
only non-Prog on television.

Safire paved the way for George Will, who performed the same act on the
David Brinkley show for years. Every newspaper in the country eventually
had a housebroken conservative as a columnist. The explosion of
conservative talk radio in the 90’s made the role less valuable, but it
remains a feature of the chattering classes. The Fox News Channel is
essentially a whole network based on the same premise. They criticize
the Left in an approved manner, never going too far or committing any
mortal sins.

The trouble these days is the legacy media has an audience that is very
old. The audience for Fox News is close to 70. The young and hip Rachel
Maddow is popular with menopausal cat ladies. The Sunday chat shows have
a similar demographic. Gen X was probably the last generation to engage
with newspapers and TV chat shows. Even there, most people under 50 are
getting their news from on-line sources. Increasingly, those on-line
sources operate in opposition to the legacy media, politically and
culturally.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That’s where a guy like Ben
Shapiro is seen as the millennial Bill Safire</a>. None other than the
New York Times has declared him “the voice of the conservative
millennial movement” and “the cool kid’s philosopher.” Shapiro is
described as a rock star on the college campus, meaning his audience is
not on blood thinners. The piece quotes National Review’s David French,
who gives Shapiro his blessing. This suggests the kept men of the legacy
Right are on board with making Shapiro the new media version of Bill
Safire.

The trouble is we no longer live in the age of three tightly controlled
TV networks and newspapers delivered by trucks. In a world where the
choices are standard issue liberals and obsequious cuckservatives, the
cucks looked pretty good. That’s not the world in which we live now.
It’s not so much that there are alternatives to the mass media. It’s
that there is so much mass media. Even if they can cultivate a guy like
Ben Shapiro into a millennial house Negro, he’s just another voice on a
giant stage full of megaphones.

The bigger issue though is the rise of alternative media. I can hear
what Ben Shapiro has to say on talk radio, cable news or read it on any
number of official websites. I’m not going to get quirky
ethno-libertarianism from anywhere but

<a href="http://therightstuff.biz/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">TRS guys</a> are a unique media presence that speaks to
the issues of our day. For truly intelligent commentary, I can go to
<a href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

are lots of people smarter, more inquisitive and more daring than Ben
Shapiro in the media now.

What’s probably going to kill the Progressive house Negro role is what’s
happening on social media. Facebook and Twitter have a problem. They
need to keep the heretics off their platform, but they need to keep
their audience. Their solution is verification. They think by
eliminating pen names and anonymous commentary, they will get rid of the
serious threats to the orthodoxy. They are probably correct, but they
are creating a whole new problem for themselves and their model of
controlled opposition.

It is really hard to pitch a Ben Shapiro as the edgy critic of the
orthodoxy when he has that seal of approval next to his name on social
media. That’s what the blue check mark now means. It says you have been
declared safe by the people in charge. That means all the house Negroes
of Conservative Inc are branded with the mark of their owner. The only
thing left to do is pass a Fugitive Pundit Act. If a faux right-wing
pundit gets red-pilled and runs off to the alt-right, we’ll be required
to return him to his media masters.
