Is the Biden administration planning to use tactical nuclear weapons
against the Russians in defense of Ukraine? It should be unthinkable but
we live in an age in which the most offensive and absurd is celebrated,
so we can no longer assume anything, no matter how monstrous, is beyond
the pale. The bombing of the Nord Stream pipelines was an outlandish act
of provocation, so we cannot assume there is anyone in the admiration on
the side of restraint.

The first clue that the Biden people are talking about the use of
nuclear weapons is their endless talking about the use of nuclear
weapons. For months they have been talking about it, in the context of
the Russians threatening to use nukes. The trouble is, the Russians have
never threatened to use nuclear weapons. Western media keeps making this
claim, but an examination of the record shows that Russian officials
have repeatedly said the exact opposite.

It is a well known aspect of regime psychology to project what they are
doing or plotting onto some enemy of the regime. In 2016 we got the
Russian collusion hoax in which Trump was accused of plotting with
foreigners to rig the election. What we eventually learned is that it
was the regime that was working with foreign intelligence services to
not only rig the election but undermine the Trump administration. The
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=561" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">opposite rule</a> is an iron law of understanding regime
behavior.

There is also the fact that Russian nuclear doctrine does not include
tactical use of nuclear weapons in the battlefield. They have tactical
nuclear weapons, but Russian nuclear doctrine has always been rooted in
deterrence. Their nuclear arsenal is designed as a deterrent against any
use of nuclear weapons. In the Cold War they took mutually assured
destruction seriously. It is the West that has the weapons and doctrine
for the limited nuclear war scenario.

Recent actions in the Ukraine make clear that the Russian plan is to
rely on conventional forces to finish off the Ukrainian army. Despite
Covid-like narratives in Western media, the Ukrainians have not been
winning. Their army has been slowly and methodically depleted. This next
phase aimed at making it more difficult for Ukraine to function at all
will be followed by fresh offensives. This time there will be a quarter
million fresh Russian troops, rather than militias.

It is clear that the Russians see a path to victory using their
conventional army and the facts on the ground support that view. The
Ukrainians are acknowledging this, which is why Zelensky has been
sounding the alarm in calls to Western media. The point is, there is no
reason to think the Russians are even thinking about using nuclear
weapons in Ukraine, but the Biden administration keeps talking about it
as if it is something they think about all the time.

There is another bit of projection at work. The West has said from the
start that Putin cannot afford to change course in Ukraine. Even while
the Russians were negotiating with the Ukrainians at the start of the
war, the claim from the Biden administration was that Putin had no
reverse gear. Again, the opposite rule seems to be at work here as the
Biden administration has repeatedly said that they will never make a
deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

Further, the Biden administration has been repeatedly asked about the
limits on supporting Ukraine and the answer is there are no limits.
Hundreds of billions have been spent on this project already. Biden was
given a blank check to send weapons, contractors and support. The
administration has repeatedly said that they are willing to support
Ukraine for as long as it takes. In other words, the only option they
will accept is the total defeat of Russia.

This leaves the administration little room to maneuver. If their goal in
this war is the total defeat of Russia and they will do whatever it
takes for as long as it takes to accomplish it, then it is the regime
that has no reverse gear. If the fortunes of Ukraine continue on the
current path, Zelensky will be faced with surrender or abdication. The
West is quickly approaching a crossroads with Ukraine. Do they continue
to throw good money after bad or do they find some other option?

As it stands, there are three options. One is to strike a deal with the
Russians, which will be on their terms as far as Ukraine is concerned.
The second is to abandon Ukraine entirely and let the Russians sort it
out after their victory. The third is some sort of game changer that
resets the war in favor of the West. Something like a small nuclear bomb
smuggled into the Crimea could be such an answer. After all, the West
did smuggle a truck bomb onto the Kerch bridge.

When you reduce it all down, the West has given itself just three
options, nuclear war, forever war and capitulation. If the third option
is off the table and the second option is failing, then the nuclear
option is what we have left. Perhaps the reason Joe Biden keeps babbling
about nuclear Armageddon is that the people running this war keep
talking about using nuclear weapons in his presence. Past regime
practice suggests this it at least a possibility.

From the perspective of the people running this war, the nuclear option
may make more sense now than a year ago. They have poured massive
amounts of arms into Ukraine and launched an unprecedented economic war
on Russia. The response from the Russians has been pretty much nothing.
Then you have the assassination of Dugin’s daughter, the bombing of the
Nord Stream pipelines and the bombing of the Kerch bridge in the Crimea.
Russia did nothing in response.

The regime may look at this and conclude they can roll the dice with a
tactical nuke into the Russian lines or maybe aimed at the Black Sea
fleet. Maybe this would be another red line that was not a red line
after all. Alternatively, the use of a nuke would cause the Russians to
mobilize their nuclear arsenal and that would be the pretext for a first
strike on Russia by the West. This is a well known tactic of the West.
They cry out in pain as they strike and use that as a reason to strike
again.

Again, it sounds insane, but giving the government the right to mutilate
children in the name of transgenderism is just as insane. A regime that
is willing to torture children is not going to draw the line at
launching nukes. Just as they can spin tales about the ghost of Kiev,
they can create a scenario in which the first use of nuclear weapons
only kills Russians and Europeans. After all, that would then be a <a
