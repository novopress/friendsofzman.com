Most online political commentary is either analysis of what is happening
in the world or dire predictions about where things are heading. The
response is often some form of “Well, what can we do about it?” On this
side of the great divide, this is usually a rhetorical question, as the
person asking knows what he wants to do. He wants to get himself and the
site on an FBI watch list.

As we see with the lawfare against Trump, the regime is determined to do
what it likes and there is nothing that can be done about it. The best
Republicans are cowards, while most are sociopathic criminals. The
former mews about what is happening, while the latter claps and cheers
on their friends across the aisle. The two-party system is just two
faces of the same monster we call the regime.

That means the formal tools citizens have to affect politics are
useless. You can vote yourself silly but the system gets worse. In fact,
this is exactly what has been happening the last couple of decades. The
system gets worse, so more people get engaged in elections, but that
makes things worse. Record turnout in 2020 gave us a deranged old men
run by the Kagan cult.

Even so, people still think in terms of elections, so the show this week
dives into what would be required to use the system to reform the
system. Then we get into the informal tools that can be used to effect
change. These are not great choices. There is not a lot of joy to be
found in the options that are available to us. The reason is a system in
crises is one that leaves open only the terrible choices.
