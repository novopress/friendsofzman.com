It is good to be back in full swing. One of the things I’m learning
about the podcasting thing is I need to take breaks. It’s easy to start
hating it when I’m doing one every week. It takes maybe ten hours each
week to put it together, but I have lots of other things in my life so
those ten hours can start to feel precious. It’s a short trip from there
to feeling like it is a chore or even a burden.

That means there is the temptation to take short cuts or get into easy
routines. Taking some breaks is a good way to keep it fresh and fun.
That last part is most important to me, since this is just a hobby. What
I found with the blog is taking a couple days off each week keeps it
fun. My hunch is the trick with podcasting is to take half a dozen weeks
off during the year. That way, it remains a fun hobby that I enjoy doing
well.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
There is also a bonus track on Gab, where I talk about the relative size
of audiences.  If you are not on Gab, you should be. Despite their
flaws, they are the good guys fighting to keep the lamps from going out
in the West.

For this week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the four longer
segments from the show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android phone
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones.
