With the new Pope being installed, this week seemed like a perfect time
to explain why Protestants are the cause of all our troubles. It is the
Protestant revolt that led to the re-emergence of paganism in the West.
That is paganism in the sense of multiple sources of authority, not the
Zeus and Athena business. Aside from some posers in the current age, the
old gods have not made a return.

The Christian revolution is a remarkable thing in the history of man as
to that point there were a lot of gods and a lot of ways to relate to
those gods. Two groups of people could share the same god, but have
different ways of serving that god. Within a society, people could have
a variety of household gods which informed how they lived and how they
related to their fellow citizens.

Christianity revolutionized this with one God for everyone and having
that God as the source of everything, including man. Once you have just
one God and one metaphysics arising from that God, then it rationally
follows that there is one correct set of rules governing how man should
live. This is the road to a universal morality that applies even to
those who are not believers.

When the universal authority of the Church was challenged, the universal
morality began to fail. After all, if the Church was wrong about the
structure of faith, it could also be wrong about the nature of God.
Calvin’s understanding God was different than the Catholic conception of
God. Once the conception of God changes, the morality and metaphysics
begin to diverge as well.

The crisis in  the West stems in large part from this divergence. The
managerial class has its gods, things like Gaia and Diversity, that it
is trying to impose on the population, but the population has its own
gods. The Bible-believing Christian who thinks he talks to Jesus every
day, not only has little in common with the homosexual Episcopalian, but
he has no choice but to reject the gods of his rulers.

That is the show this week. It is a topic that probably deserves a ten
hour commitment, but maybe that is something for the end of the year.
The focus for now is how the Protestant revolts in the 16th century set
off this process by which we now find ourselves in a new pagan age. Zeus
and Odin have yet to make their appearance, but maybe they just have
different names and guises this time.
