One of the weird things about this phase of liberal democracy has been
the normalization of conspiracy theories. Thirty years ago, everyone,
regardless of their political inclinations or what they thought of the
other side, dismissed the claims of the conspiracy community. At best
the deep state conspiracy was a plot device for a fantastical Hollywood
script. At worst, it was a sign that the person may be struggling with
mental illness.

Today most people think there is a deep state. In fact, the phrase deep
state has become a normal part of discourse. In conventional politics it
can mean anything from the leaders of both parties to nefarious forces
controlling the institutions. George Soros is part of the deep state,
even though the deep state is supposed to be a shadowy group of people
unknown to the general public. Even secret societies need to be
personalized, so the deep state has many public faces.

You do not have to line your clothes with aluminum foil to wonder if
there is not something going on off camera that explains what is
happening. For example, the berserk effort by Western government to
“decarbonize” the West looks like a suicide pact by a collection of cult
leaders. How can these people really think it is good idea to shut down
Dutch farming to save Gaia? How does returning Germany to using wood for
heat make any sense? There must be something else.

Of course, we all know that there is no such thing as a deep state but
it is not hard to see why people are open to it. It is sort of like the
concept of space-time. That is, it is an invention of mankind to help
explain the universe. The fact that it does not exist is not really
important because it allows physics to explore the universe. At some
point it will be abandoned for a deeper understanding. The same may be
true of the deep state in that it works for now, even though it is not
real.

For example, when you see an ad for something like plant based milk you
are supposed to think, “why yes, I would prefer this over actual milk.”
Then your brain reminds you that we have no need for plant-based milk.
We have plenty of actual milk. The reason we have lots of real milk is
we invented refrigeration so that we no longer have to rely upon things
like almond milk. That is when that concept of the deep state fills in
the blank and you begin to wonder what they are up to with this.

This is when someone chimes in about lactose intolerance, but you do not
build a church for Easter Sunday and you do not build an industry for
people who cannot digest milk enzymes. Similarly, you do not invest
billions on meat made from twigs and bugs that “tastes almost like real
meat!” Similarly, you do not bother inventing eggs made from grass that
are almost like real eggs. These are solutions in search of a problem,
perhaps a problem contemplated by the deep state.

Now, solutions in search of a problem are not new. The e-book was
supposed to replace the real book, but there was never a need to replace
the book. It was the result of two thousand years of evolution starting
with the early Christians. By the 20th century it was the ideal solution
to distributing the written word. That did not stop smart people from
pushing the idea of the e-book. Innovation is as much about bad ideas
and it is the few good ideas that are genuine improvements on the old
ideas.

In the present age, the managerial class plays an outsized role in
picking winners and losers, so there is money to be made exploiting
their hopes and fears. This has always been the genius of Elon Musk. His
projects all tap into the boutique beliefs of the managerial class. He
is a futurist selling futuristic solutions to the problems of the future
to people haunted by the prospect they will not see the glorious future.
They are willing to spend your money to achieve their dreams.

Klaus Schwab is working the same grift. The World Economic Forum is a
crackpot idea that appeals to the vanity of the managerial class. It did
not get much traction until he was able to hook a few billionaires to
attend his event. That was the validation needed to turn the thing into
Burning Man for the managerial elite. They go to be seen with their
analogs in the other parts of the managerial class. The deep state vibe
is part of the appeal to people who spend their days in committees.

What has happened over the last thirty years since the end of the Cold
War is the Western managerial class has evolved both a class
consciousness and a messianic religion that binds them together. It is
why they have become so paranoid about the people over whom they rule. A
big part of being a Cloud Person is thinking about how much you disdain
the Dirt People. Displaying your cloudiness is often just expressing
your contempt for dirtiness.

This is why the concept of the deep state has caught on. From the
perspective of the Dirt People, it looks like there is a secret set of
hands guiding the movement of the clouds and the people inhabiting them.
When all of a sudden, every chattering skull on television is chanting
“keev” you cannot help but think it is scripted. The ads for food made
from bugs make a lot more sense when you imagine a secret cabal plotting
to kill off farming to please Gaia.

Like space-time, the concept of the deep state works because it allows
for the further exploration of the environment in which we find
ourselves. The fact that it is not a real thing, at least not in the way
it is used, does not matter right now. Blaming Klaus Schwab or Bill
Gates for the current crisis is fine. Waging war on the people profiting
from the system is almost as good as attacking the system itself. For
most people, raging against the deep state is comforting.

Just as the reality of the universe lies beyond the interface of
space-time, the reality of the managerial state lies beyond the deep
state. It is not a collection of super villains controlling the world.
It is a system that produces the super villains it needs to control the
population over which it rules. If Klaus Schwab did not exist, the
system would simply invent him just as physics invented space-time.
These bad guys are a necessary interface to the managerial system.

There is another aspect to the deep state interface. It is comforting.
The people invited to the soiree’s like WEF and Davos get to think they
are influencers, shaping the mind of the deep state actors. The Cloud
People can be sure there is a powerful force guiding their hand. The
Dirt People get the comfort of knowing there is a rational actor behind
the movement of the clouds. Perhaps he is amenable to reason or perhaps
he can one day be defeated by the Dirt People.

Maybe like space-time, the deep state interface will be useful in
breaking the system open to expose its internal workings. On the other
hand, it may come to be a great impediment to understanding the world.
There are some who think space-time has inhibited our ability to
understand the universe. Regardless, the deep state does not exist, but
it is useful. Like electric cars and milk made from bugs, it has a
purpose, even if we cannot be sure whose ends it serves.
