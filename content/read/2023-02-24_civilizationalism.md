Thirty years ago two competing theories about what comes next emerged
from the end of the Cold War. One was the end of history thesis by
Francis Fukuyama and the other was the clash of civilizations
<a href="https://archive.is/V8oH2" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">thesis</a> by Samuel Huntington. The former carried the
day, but it is the latter that is proving to be closer to reality. Even
so, it is the Fukuyama thesis that continues to animate Western thought.

Reality is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing in it
and reality is telling us that Huntington was the better thesis. He got
some things wrong about what comes next, but his general thesis is
proving correct. The new global order that is emerging is based in
civilizational identity. In a way, the world is returning to its natural
state after the long fever of the 20th century.

The exception, at least for now, is the West, but it does provide some
clue as to what will happen in the West. The new diverse societies being
created will have to be organized around something. The civilizational
idea allows for the native population to impose their will on the guest
populations. It also allows the natives to defend their ways at whatever
cost is required.
