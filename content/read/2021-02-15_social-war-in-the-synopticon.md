**Note:** The regular
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-impeachment-show/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Monday post Taki post</a> is up. This
week is a look at the vulgar circus we call Washington and the carny
trash running it. There’s also some new content up behind the green
door. This week I review the 1951 classic, A Place In The Sun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When one takes a look at what is happening in the West, particularly the
English speaking nations, the first thing to notice is the lack of
vocabulary. Is this a civil war we are seeing or is it just cultural
unrest? How should the sides be labeled? The people in charge of the
institutions call themselves the resistance and their declared enemies
are people devoid of any power, beyond numbers. Those people call
themselves the silent majority, despite not being silent or a majority.

Just as the labels make little sense, the comparisons to fictional and
historical examples do not hold up either. Is what we are experiencing
like Orwell’s 1984? Not in any meaningful way. It may be closer to
Huxley’s Brave New World, but our managerial class is nothing like the
World State, in terms of intelligence and purpose. There is no Mustafa
Mond in our ruling class. Similarly, the comparisons to authoritarian
states of the past are nothing more than superficial.

While there is nothing new in this age with regards to the human
condition and human relations, we live in a new age. Technological
progress brought about by the microprocessor is changing the nature of
human society. While Orwell could imagine a world where everyone is
watched by the state, he could not imagine a world where everyone is
watched by everyone. Huxley could imagine a highly ordered society
controlled by a few; he could not imagine artificial intelligence.

That is the first bit of language that needs defining. The panopticon is
a concept most know, as it is a trope in many movies. This is the world
where a few watches the many, like in a prison. The guards use cameras,
search lights and electronic detection devices to monitor the prisoners.
The idea behind it is that the prisoners never really know if they are
being watched at any moment, but they know that they could be watched at
any moment, no matter where they are in the system.

America is now a *synopticon*. This is a term coined by
Norwegian sociologist Thomas Mathiesen to describe a society in which
the few are watched by many. While the panopticon is a one-to-many
relationship, with the one being the controlling authority, the
synopticon is a many-to-many relationship. Any one person can be watched
by many, but also part of the many watching another. It is a world where
everyone is an input devise, feeding what they hear and see into the
system.

This is an important concept. It is a system. The people holding up
their mobile phones and posting the results to their social media page
are not operating as conscious agents of the state or any particular
interest. They are just nodes on the system. The same is true of the
various devices deployed to monitor behavior. The people installing them
may have a reason, but that reason exists within the system itself. That
surveillance video posted to the cloud is consumed by the synopticon as
data.

Take a second to consider how many eyes are on you at any moment. If you
own a modern automobile, it is tracking and reporting your driving
habits. Your phone, of course, is tracking your whereabouts and the
people you meet. CCTV cameras silently record your activity. Your web
browser tracks your reading habits. The smart TV monitors your viewing
habits. If you have one of the security devices or a smart home device,
it is keeping tabs on you inside your home.

If you wanted to get a visual image of what your life is like in the
synopticon, imagine a world where everyone is naked, lives in glass
houses and can see that everyone is looking at everyone else. Now,
imagine yourself observing that world and noticing that everyone is sure
they are not, in fact, naked, living in a glass house and being watched
all the time. In the panopticon, everyone knows they are being watched
and by whom, but in the synopticon, people sense it, but do not see it.

Unlike the panopticon, where humans are looking for unacceptable
behavior, in the synopticon the system does this on its own. For
example, the system can examine the data coming in to model communities
within society.
<a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/community_detection/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Community detection</a> algorithms can discover
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">relationships</a> within the complex
nature of human societies. Further, it can begin to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">model those communities</a> and predict
behavior of the community, as well as the members of that community,
from the data stream.

If you are at the top of the synopticon, this is useful technology as it
allows you to reverse engineer social behavior that you wish to
suppress. The vast database of human activity that is the synopticon can
be used to analyze and understand the attachment members of a subculture
have to one another. What commitment level exists among and between
members. The value system that holds the group together and how it
shapes their activity. This is called <a
href="https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/36812_5.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Social Bond Theory</a>.

Another key concept to this new world is the social war. In agrarian and
industrial societies, civil unrest leads to civil war or possibly
revolution. A civil war is when factions within the elite draft the
population into their dispute. A revolution is when a new elite rises up
outside the old elite and attempts to overthrow them. A social war is
one in which all participant groups can be at war with one another, but
also in league with one another, for reasons they do not necessarily
understand.

An example of this in the modern age is the Antifa phenomenon. They
claim to be the heirs of Marxist anti-fascists, but they are not
Marxists. They have no coherent ideology, beyond a juvenile form of
anarchism. Their opposition is equally ephemeral, as there are no actual
fascists in this age. Similarly, their sponsors are in a constant state
of agitation, despite control of the institutions. The more they seem to
control, the less control they feel they have and the greater their
agitation.

What we are experiencing is a social war. Everyone in the system sense
they are losing control of the social code that shapes behavior. They
seek to regain control of that social code through the conventional
means, but winning and losing those fights has no impact on their
control of the culture. The imposition of bizarre new moral codes by the
elite, for example, are a reaction to their sense of powerlessness. The
growing bourgeois radicalism is also a reaction to the perceived loss of
control.

That is the key here. A civil war is about control of the state. A
revolution is about the same thing, with the added aspect of ideological
conflict. A social war is about control of the social code, the
invisible set of rules that govern human behavior. As the synopticon
takes greater control of that code, the people inside find themselves at
war with an invisible enemy, the system itself. This manifests as
something like prison gang fights, where frustrations are directed at
the visible, rather than the system.

The evolution of the synopticon appears to be a process, perhaps a
runaway process, that has escaped the control of the creator. As the
friction within society increases, as people are increasingly
constrained by the social control systems, the synopticon evolves
greater control. Modern society is looking like a boiling pot. The more
it boils, the tighter the lid is drawn down. Inside, the increasingly
aggressive and antagonistic conflict is causing the pot to boil more
violently.

This is where we are now. It is not a Hobbesian war of all against all,
but rather an increasing friction between members of society. This
friction arises from their increasingly confined social space. It turns
out that the old axiom about familiarity breeding contempt is true.
Instead of a society becoming more cooperative as it becomes more
integrated, it is becoming increasingly hostile. Meanwhile, the
synopticon jams us all closer together, in all our hostile ugliness.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
