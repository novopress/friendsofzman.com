This is the first post using the latest version of WordPress that
automatically updated overnight. It is complete garbage. It is as if
they formed a committee tasked with ruining the product by making it
more difficult to use. One of my goals for 2019 is to move off WordPress
entirely and now I am much more motivated to do it. I am not sure if the
YouTube or Spreaker embed will work, but we shall see. I am not sure how
any of this will work.

Also, this week, I have been de-platformed by Spotify. Apparently, the
tender little babies who make up their customer base were vexed by my
presence. I do not know how many people were listening to me via that
platform, but it must have been enough to get the attention of their
morality officers. Frankly, Spotify is a garbage platform anyway, so I
really do not care. It says something bad about the younger generation
that they like that platform. It is radio for people who like being told
what to like.

Anyway, this week almost did not come off as I was busy with the above
ground life, but a foolish consistency is important in these things.
That and I was not sure what to do this week, other than the French
stuff. Then looking around, I found other fires burning that are worth
discussing, so we have a show about issues on the edge of the abyss. It
is funny, but whenever I get stumped for content, the world comes to my
rescue.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
