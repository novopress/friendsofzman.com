According to Merriam-Webster, hope is a desire accompanied by
expectation of or belief in fulfillment. You want something to happen.
You have little or no reason to think it will happen, yet you sense that
it is going to happen. Hope and faith are traveling partners, in that
hope is often the result of trusting a system or person. The system has
worked in the past, so despite evidence that it is not going to work
this time, you hope that it carries through again.

Hope and faith are the cornerstones of elections. In the best of times,
people are left to hope that the guy who wins will do a decent job. Even
when it is obvious that the winner will be a dud, maybe even crazy,
people have faith in the system to carry us through the ineptitude of
the office holders. Popular government requires people to believe that
all of us are smarter than most of us. Every couple of years people hope
this is true as they cast their ballots for people they barely know.

What we have seen over the last thirty years is that some people, the
people we call the Left, have increasingly lost faith in the system.
Their reason for voting is not the hope that it will continue on, but
that this time it finally fails. Barak Obama was the turning point with
his constant talk about hope and change. The whole point of his
presidency was to destroy the old system and replace it with a new one.
He was the change they had been waiting for.

The looming presidential election is looking like a similar inflection
point for the people we call the Right. In 2016, most of them voted for
Trump, hoping he would be a message to the system. People voted for
Trump as a rebuke, an often crudely humorous rebuke, of official
Washington. These people still had faith in the system, so they hoped
that Trump could deliver the message. The people were unhappy, and
Washington needed to address their concerns.

This time, much of the support for Trump is like the hope and change
business that Obama ran on in 2008. People saw what happened in the
Trump years and they have been following the aftermath. They no longer
have faith in the system. The system produced this corrupt ruling class.
The thinking is that another Trump term will cause so much anger in
official Washington that they will go berserk. Everyone else will then
see that the system is hopelessly broken.

There is still some faith in the system. Lots of the MAGA hat wearing
folks think this time will be different, but a good chunk of his support
is cynical. This is why his support is so solid, despite the presence of
Ron DeSantis. People know that in a normal country with a functioning
political system, DeSantis would be the far better choice, but America
is no longer a normal country. Prudent administration is not the answer
to a demonic ruling class hellbent on pulling the roof down on us.

On the other hand, Ron DeSantis is the hope and faith option. His
support is entirely from people who still have faith in the system.
<a href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/06/03/pardon-me-for-taking-sides/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the venerable Paul Gottfried
coming out in support of DeSantis over Trump. Josh Hammer, a member of
the common good conservative club, is also
<a href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/05/26/the-case-for-ron-desantis/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">supporting</a> DeSantis. Pedro Gonzalez
<a
href="https://chroniclesmagazine.org/columns/trumpism-the-myth-the-man-and-the-mandate/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">sounds</a> like Bill Kristol in coming
out in favor of DeSantis. Three people from three different perspectives
making the same argument.

These folks and the others supporting DeSantis think the system is
mostly fine, but it needs the right guy to get the right result. They
hope DeSantis is that guy, because after all, he “got things done” in
Florida. For his supporters, Florida is a model for how things ought to
run. DeSantis is therefore the model for how an executive pulls the
right levers in the system in order to get the desired result. The fact
that Florida is nothing like Washington plays no role in their thinking.

DeSantis is the last gasp of conservatism. Until the catastrophe of the
Bush years, the subtext to conservatism was that it needed to be
presented to the Left in just the right way so as not to upset them.
Conservatism had to sneak up on lefty with a pleasant-sounding program
presented by someone they liked or at least they could not plausibly
claim was Hitler. For the DeSantis supporters, their guy is Trumpism
without the crude orange man that makes the regime so angry.

Of course, their support rests on the assumption that the right man can
get in there and pull the right levers to get the right result. It also
assumes that the people in opposition will go along with this. The
shadow of ignorance about the nature of the people in charge hangs over
the DeSantis supporters. They are sure that the other side wants what
they want and that they do not believe what they say. They just need a
good talking to and they will stop the nonsense.

The hard reality is that the people who run the empire want what they
want, and they will not be talked out of it by an election. The reason
they recoiled like a startled snake when Trump came to town is because
they feared him. He represented a threat to their preferred order, so
they sunk their venomous fangs into his presidency. They will do the
same thing to the next guy if he proves to be a threat. There is no way
to clear out this nest of vipers at the ballot box.

In the 2016 election, Michael Anton famously penned the Flight 93
election essay that allowed many on the Right to throw in with Trump.
The essay was an argument in favor of Trump as one last desperate
attempt to save the system. The fact that the Trump presidency ended
like the famous flight did not register with many people. Some of them
are now throwing in with DeSantis for the same reason. It is one last
desperate attempt to save the system, in which they still have faith.

According to Hesiod, when Prometheus stole fire from the gods, Zeus took
vengeance by giving the lovely Pandora to Epimetheus, the brother of
Prometheus. She was left with a jar and told not to open it. Being a
woman, this meant she could do nothing else but open it and out came all
the evils that plague the world. She quickly put the lid back on, but
the only thing remaining was what is often translated as hope, but which
could also mean deceptive expectation.

In 2016 the Dirt People stole fire from the gods in that they defied
their masters and supported Trump in the primary then the general
election. Instead of sending a jar containing plagues, they sent another
ballot box. In 2020 that box was opened and out came the secret police
to carry Joe Biden to the White House. Despite it all, some still cling
that that ballot box, hope trapped inside, thinking that maybe this time
when they open the box, their hopes will be realized.
