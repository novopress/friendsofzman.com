The sharks are begging to accumulate off the coast of the Biden
administration, as his popularity falls along with his cognitive
functioning. The current polling has him at or near the lowest ever
recorded for a sitting president. His party is in a panic over the
upcoming midterm elections. There is an obvious shift going on in the
media where they signal that it is time to think about what comes after
Joe Biden. Now the first dorsal fins of potential replacements are
showing up in the water.

The first fin to pop up was that of Gavin Newsom, the current governor
of California and former mayor of San Francisco. He recently ran an ad
in Florida telling the locals that their state is terrible, they smell
like feet and the smart ones should leave the filthy place and come to
California. Presumably, his team thinks this is a way to pick a fight
with Ron DeSantis, who has become a bogeyman for his cult. They seem to
have forgotten that Florida is a critical swing state in elections.

Newsom turning up at the White House while Biden is visiting Israel
suggests that the people in charge wanted to send a message. A child of
extreme privilege, Newsom got richer by partnering with the fourth so of
oil tycoon John Paul Getty. They started a winery and then a private
equity firm that targeted entertainment properties catering to the
managerial elite. Newson got bored with that and bought himself a
mayoral office and then the governorship of California.

To his credit, he is one of the few politicians alive today who has ever
signed the front of a paycheck and done any sort of real work. Granted,
these are silly businesses that look like they were underwritten to make
his resume look good. Boutique wineries and hipster restaurants are
different from making car parts or fixing refrigeration units, but it at
least looks like real work. He will no doubt run as a self-made man who
knows how businesspeople struggle in these difficult times.

Another fin in the water is Gretchen Whitmer. She is up for reelection
and has been getting lots of favorable news coverage. She gets to speak
to important Democratic party groups and was on Biden’s short list of VP
choices. He passed on her as she is too ambitious. The people around
Biden had him select Harris as a form of life insurance policy. Just as
no one would take out Obama with Biden as VP, no one is going to take
out Biden with Harris as VP.

Whitmer’s resume is the dreary stuff we have come to expect. She has
been on the dole her whole life. Her biggest claim to fame is the
kidnapping hoax, which may have started as a campaign trick. It is hard
to know, but so far, we know it was orchestrated by the FBI and not the
patsies they put on trial. Her former lawyer seems to be involved with
the FBI handlers. The whole thing is a seedy example of FBI corruption
but also how big a role they play in politics.

The final fin in the water of Kamala Harris. Up until a few weeks ago,
she was programmed to chant about how she looked forward to running with
Biden in 2024 whenever asked about it. Someone swapped out her response
code with a new response designed to give the impression she hopes Biden
dies soon. This is probably the only way she ever becomes president.
Even with support from Biden she stands little chance of winning the
nomination on her own in 2024.

The main reason for looking at this is to note the long term planning
that goes on with presidential candidates. Rich people thought Newsom
could be president twenty-five years ago so they have been grooming him
for this moment. That is a long term commitment to a project. The same
is true of Whitmer. The kidnapping hoax is the sort of thing you do when
you think she can run ten years hence as a tough independent female who
stood up to the patriarchy as a governor.

The other interesting thing about the fins sticking out of the water is
the Democrats are going to look for a white person in 2024. Harris ticks
the brown boxes, but the wrong brown boxes as far as Democratic voters
are concerned. Look around at other potential fins in the water and they
all look like great whites as well. The Left’s commitment to diversity
is like Pelosi and Biden’s commitment to Catholicism. It is a ceremonial
item that has no bearing on how they live or think.

This is something the dullards in conservatism, which is pretty much all
of conservatism, never seem to grasp. The chanting about white
supremacy, antiracism, diversity and so on is a uniform these people
wear to signal their commitment to their class. Fifty years ago, they
walked around in brand new work clothes to signal their solidarity with
the working man. Today they wear the language of diversity, inclusion
and equity to show their solidarity with the swarthy fellows tending
their gardens.

Putting all of that aside, the next six months promise some good
political entertainment as the number of fins in the water reaches
critical mass. While there is no reason to vote for Republicans, there
are enough people mad at the economy to switch both the House and the
Senate this fall. That will lead to a public debate about what to do
with the aging Joe Biden. Do they let him serve out his term or do they
push him down a flight of stairs after the election?

A year ago, the way to bet was on the unexpected tumble, but Harris has
been so bad that swapping Biden for her is probably a bad bet. The
people running the White House need Biden in place as they secure new
places in the next regime. That means they put out word that Biden is
re-thinking his 2024 plans. Sometime in the winter he announces his
retirement after his first term in office. That also shifts the focus
from the failures of Biden to the future failures of the next regime.

On the other hand, the 2020 election says that anything is possible so
Biden running and winning in 2024 is not unthinkable. The beautiful
people love firsts so he can be the first man in a coma to win election.
Maybe the first man with a single digit approval rating to win
reelection. After all, he was the first man to lose the first four
primaries and still win his party’s nomination. He also got eighty
million votes in the general election, which says that in America
anything is possible.
