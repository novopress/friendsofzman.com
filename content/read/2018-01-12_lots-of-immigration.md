This week I’m trying out some new ideas and some new material. I’m
thinking about a weekly segment on ghetto life. These are always popular
posts, so maybe it will work as a regular segment on the podcast. I’m
sort of the Dian Fossey of the Dissident Right, so people are interested
in my observations. The ghetto posts always get a lot of traffic so
we’ll see if works as a podcast segment. No, it will not be replacing
the Afro-Futurism segments. More of a complement.

The other thing I’m adding is a history segment. I get a lot of comments
about history related posts, especially if they tie into present events.
I’m a big fan of history podcasts, so maybe this is something that will
work for me. Maybe I have a calling about which I am unaware. I’ve got a
lot of material stocked away for use in future posts, so my cup runneth
over as far as material. I’m doing a short bit this week so, we’ll see.

I am dropping the clips from YouTube. It is a lot of work and very few
people preferred the bite sized version. Instead, I will post them on
Gab over the course of the week. I’m still feeling my way through how to
distribute and promote a podcast. One thing I’ve learned is YouTube is
best for video. The channels without lots of graphics, or someone
looking out from the monitor, get little traffic.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard
format. Spreaker has the full show. I’ll be posting clips on Gab for the
ADD listeners. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android commies can
take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on iTunes, which
means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones. Of
course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never finish.
