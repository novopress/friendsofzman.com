The first time I heard of modern supper clubs was from John Derbyshire.
I don’t recall the specifics, just that he said he was a member of one
in New York City. I want to say it was in one of his podcasts, but I
don’t recall. That’s not important. I was surprised to learn such things
were still going on. It seemed like a thing Victorians would do or
perhaps rich people in the roaring twenties. When I think of supper
clubs, I think of something clandestine and subversive, the sorts of
things popular with heretics.

I decided to see if any of these things existed in my part of the world
and sure enough, they were around and not very secret about it. One of
my business acquaintances is in one that meets once a month. They have
invited speakers who give a short talk and then socialize with the club
members. In the case of my acquaintance, the theme of the club is civic
activism. They help get rich people involved in various causes to
improve the city or get some law changes they think needs changing.

Anyway, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">I saw this</a> and was reminded of Derb’s
clandestine supper club. It turns out they are not legal and perhaps
even subversive, in a  strange modern way. Because everything in modern
life is regulated, especially in a place like New York, not getting
permission to have dinner with friends is something close to an act of
treason. I suppose the next time we hear from John Derbyshire will be in
the police blotter. It sounds absurd, but this is New York City. They
want to regulate the amount of soda you can drink.

All joking aside, it is one of those little things, a blade of grass
stabbing through the asphalt, that encourages me a bit. Tocqueville
found American’s obsession with what he called associations to be an
important part of what made American liberty work:

> The political associations that exist in the United States are only a
> single feature in the midst of the immense assemblage of associations
> in that country. Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all
> dispositions constantly form associations. They have not only
> commercial and manufacturing companies, in which all take part, but
> associations of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious,
> futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive. The Americans
> make associations to give entertainments, to found seminaries, to
> build inns, to construct churches, to diffuse books, to send
> missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they found hospitals,
> prisons, and schools. If it is proposed to inculcate some truth or to
> foster some feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form
> a society. Wherever at the head of some new undertaking you see the
> government in France, or a man of rank in England, in the United
> States you will be sure to find an association.

The fact that even in New York City, citizens are willing to commit
little acts of subversion in league with others, often strangers, says
the flame of liberty has not been extinguished entirely. Granular
control of the lives of the citizenry has a cost, as people just won’t
cooperate. The current arrangements cannot last and that means they will
not last. The question is what comes next. If these little dinner clubs
are any indication, maybe what comes next will not be so bad, perhaps
even better than what we see now.
