week, the podcast stinks. For some reason it was just not coming to me
and I struggled getting it done. Hence the title. That’s the thing you
have to learn in all endeavors is that sometimes, good enough is good
enough. On the other hand, you will always be your harshest critic,
which means you can easily make things hard on yourself by trying to
hard. Figuring out when to put down the tools and call it a day is part
of the process.

This week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and
some new graphics to distinguish the bits from the full show. I am now
on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can now listen to me on their
Hitler phones.You’ll also a note I have renamed this thing, which is
explained in the podcast.

I will be streaming this to GabTV at some point, but I have some
wrenches to turn before I can get that working. I’ll update the site
when that is working, if I’m able to do it.
