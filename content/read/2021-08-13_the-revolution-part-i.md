Revolutions are often driven by events, but they are always, at some
level, driven by ideas about how society ought to be organized. Since
the beginning, radical revolution is about a small group of
intellectuals who flatter themselves by claiming to represent the
interests of the people. Their holy mission is to reorganize society for
the benefit of the people, even if it means killing many of those
people. This week begins an exploration into the ideas that motivate our
current radicals.

One of the problems the good guys have is a poverty of language to
properly frame the events of the day. The bad guys have six million ways
to frame events, so they are the white hats and normal people are the
black hats. Despite what many claim, this is not about convincing the
public. It is about justifying to themselves their actions against the
people resisting the revolution. For the people who see themselves as
the vanguard of the people, this is important fuel to the revolutionary
fire.

The poverty of language stems from a poverty of understanding. The
typical conservative pundit has never read any of the radical thinkers
who have shaped the minds of the present day radicals. They are happy to
chant catch phrases like “socialist” and “communist” but those words
just mean “bad guys”. Then you have people who reduce everything to a
money grab, which is nothing but a passive way of endorsing the
transactional nature of modern existence.

With that in mind, this week’s show is a look at three of the big topics
that come up with the radicals in the current crisis. The idea here is
not to give a lecture on the writers and texts behind these issues, but
to provide a general framework for understand what the radicals mean
when they say certain things. There is a lot here, so next week will be
another show on the same general topic, but on other subtopics. Who
knows, maybe it will turn out to be three shows of material.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
