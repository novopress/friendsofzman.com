The Catholics say despair is a sin and perhaps it is, but it is hard to
be optimistic about the world when you see stories like <a

target="_blank">this one</a>. Even allowing for the possibility there
could be more to the story than what is being reported, how can society
survive when this sort of thing  is even plausible?

Detriment to the dead? How is it possible that such a combination of
words exists, much less made its ways into the law? Now, loopy nonsense
gets into the law for various reasons and maybe this is the case, but
civil authorities appear to be ready to charge a man for insulting the
dead. How is this different from charging someone with being a wizard?
The underlying assumption is that through some magical means, the insult
reaches the insulted. I guess the prosecutor will use a Ouija board at
trial to get a victim statement.

That’s only half the problem. What sort of person reported the guy?
presumably, someone complained. In Europe, it is against the law to hurt
someone’s feelings so I would assume that’s the angle. The accused
insulted the dead, which made someone sad so the accused must be made to
suffer. This is old testament justice for the snowflake age. Instead of
eye-for-an-eye, it’s boo-boo for boo-boo justice.  The fact that this
exists and people go along with it suggests there no hope for the West.
Only a mass die off like the Black Plague can fix this.

It’s not so much that some women called the authorities on this guys.
You just know it is a woman who dropped the dime. It is always a woman
behind these things. It’s that people in positions of responsibility
encourage this sort of thing. For all of human history, the ruling class
discouraged this sort of behavior as they knew it could get out of hand
quickly. The prosecutors or police who took this call should have
politely listened, promised to look into it and then forgot about it.
That’s how you’re supposed to handle community cranks.

We’re doomed.
