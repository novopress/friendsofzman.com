------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative history is one of those things that should be more popular
in Hollywood, as it opens the door for creativity. “What if the South
won the Civil War” would let the filmmaker run wild with all sorts of
claims about the past, for example. For the same reason, it should be
more popular with people in general. It makes for a good start to a
campfire story. “Imagine if our enemies from the past had won and we
were forced to live in a world of their creation…” is a good scary
story.

For whatever reason, alternative history is not very popular.
Revisionist history, on the other hand is popular. In fact, revisionism,
outside of one subject, is the norm in the history departments of the
West. The only thing historians do is question the official narrative of
various historical events. The new narrative usually tries to explain
the past according to the new morality. Fitting the past into the great
story justifying the moral claims of the people in charge is the point
of history.

This is why any attempt to question the official narrative of the Second
World War is strictly prohibited. The entire ruling class structure is
built upon the myths and legends fabricated in the aftermath of the war.
The moral center of the American empire is the assertion that the
morality of the empire is universal. More important, it is the logical
endpoint of the great historical dialectic. It is the fulfillment of the
opening lines to the Declaration of Independence, words made flesh.

This has created a massive blind spot in our ruling class. By condemning
old enemies, especially the fascists, to the pit of the demons, they
don’t have to think much about those systems and how they could have
evolved. How would fascism have evolved if the British cut a deal with
the Germans over Poland? If not for Churchill’s blood lust for war, a
deal could have been made to avert war in the West. How would that have
changed the course of fascism in both Germany and Italy?

One possible outcome is it would have quickly evolved into something
very similar to what we see in America. The rapid rebuild of the German
economy by the fascists bound the state and corporate interests in a way
that is familiar to us today. Organized labor was suppressed, in favor
of the state speaking for labor. This is not much different from the
present model in America. Using Jews and Slavs as cheap labor is not all
that different from what American business does with guest workers.

It is generally assumed that the economic model of fascism could never
last, as it was really just a form of war socialism. First it was the
war on the devastating consequences of the Great War. Then it was the
build up to reassert power in Europe. Once war broke out, the economies
of fascist states were organized around war. This type of economics is
assumed to burn bright but not last. If left alone, the inequities would
lead to social unrest and demands for reform.

This was the experience of the Bolsheviks, in a different context. The
revolution and then the civil war forced the party to requisition
everything they could touch and put it toward the war effort. Once the
civil war was over, it became clear that the system could not last.
People would not continue to sacrifice their labor for the party when
the party was no longer under direct threat. How long would the German
people have tolerated the iron rule of the party without the threat of
war?

The present gives us some clue. For some time now America has lived
under the iron grip of the uniparty. The last agent of change produced
by the political system was Reagan and that was half a century ago. The
reforms of Reagan were popular, but never challenged the ruling class.
Since then, the system has produced one clone after another, with the
exception of Trump. He was quickly neutralized and then ejected from the
system like a dangerous foreign object from the body.

The party has also kept the country on a war footing. The Cold War
shaped the American empire and the ruling class. They need war to exist,
so when the Cold War ended, the search for new enemies commenced. First,
we got the crusades against the Muslims, which got started with Bush I.
Now it is a tossup between China and Russia as to who will be the new
devil. The uniparty needs war socialism and war socialism needs an enemy
to justify its excesses.

This is why some believe the fascists would have had no choice but to
start a war in Europe, even if the British had not been so willing. This
type of political system needs to be on war footing. The permanent
revolution of communist systems is an effort to institutionalize the
creation of enemies around which the system can rally. The current war
on white people is very similar. It is an effort to create a permanent
enemy of the party that can never be defeated, but must always be
opposed.

Of course, the American empire has been at war for close to a century,
but unlike the fascists or communists, it persists. The reason is it has
not picked the wrong enemies around which to organize the war. It could
have been dumb luck. The Soviets came to believe they had to tread
lightly around the Americans. The Kennedy administration’s desire to
blow up the world over Cuba was a key lesson. The American ruling class
was composed of fanatics, not sober minded realists.

Taken together, it suggests that there really was no alternative
timeline in which war was averted and the fascists tried to figure out
how to make it work. The Americans were on the prowl for an enemy. The
fascists systems needed an enemy to justify their control of society.
Stalin’s revolution from above required an enemy around which to
organize and he was running out of internal enemies to kill. The great
contest between various forms of war socialism was inevitable.
