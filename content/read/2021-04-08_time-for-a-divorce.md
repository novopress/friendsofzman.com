Elections in America have always been contentious things, as the point
of them is to get all sides as agitated as possible. If you wanted to
find the point at which our elections turned ugly it would be when the
concept of turnout became the focus. The surest way to get your guys
motivated to vote is to convince them that the alternative is pure evil,
the worst thing imaginable. Since one side will always lose, it means
something close to half the country is always angry at the result.

The thing is though, it was always a game and most people got it. The
candidates would say the vilest things about one another, but then carry
on like old pals during a debate, showing the world they did not really
mean those things. In fact, this is why the Left has controlled the
country. Everyone else has always been sure the Left was not really
serious about what they were saying. Despite it all, many people remain
convinced that the Left today is just putting on a show.

That may be one of the factors creating the current crisis. The eruption
of mass media over the last couple of decades puts the Left in our face
all the time. There is no escaping politics today, which means there is
no escaping the Left. Watch a sporting event and there will be lefty
political preaching. Check the weather for your trip to the beach and
you get a lecture on global warming. Go outside and you see people
wearing three masks in their car, letting you know they are in that
cult.

Of course, social media is like standing in front of a firehose. Even if
you only want to follow something banal like entertainment news, you
will be drenched in political commentary, almost entirely from the Left.
The carnies all fashion themselves as philosophers now. The athletes
have made politics a feature of their act. These are the dumbest,
crudest people in our society, but they are sure you need to know what
they have to say about current events.

There is another part to this. Along with not being able to escape the
left-wing crazies, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is no
living with them. Politics, regardless of the system, is about
compromise. The opposing sides find some middle ground that they can
accept or some combination of their proposals that prevent either side
from feeling cheated by the other. In a democracy, compromise is based
on the understanding that both sides want what is best.

How do you reach a compromise with someone who thinks invisible men from
a faraway land used mind control to change an election? On top of that,
they were perfectly willing to destroy the country over it. If one side
is sure the other side is evil, there can never be a compromise. The
best you can get is a truce in the hostilities, but eventually one side
will attack again. After all, any compromise with evil is immoral on its
face, so the only more thing to do is confront it.

Take a look at [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/GenMhayden/status/1379555037450493955) from a
man who is the former Director of CIA & NSA. He is convinced that we
need to round up citizens and put them in concentration camps because
they said things he does not like. The regime has already imprisoned
dozens of people on trumped up charges. America is now a country with
[political prisoners being
tortured](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/06/capitol-riot-defendant-alleges-beating-by-jail-guards-479413)
while in prison. This ghoul wants to institutionalize the persecution
and torture of Americans who disagree with official policy.

How can you compromise with a person who literally wants you dead? Even
if you dismiss him as a fanatic, look at the responses. The people
replying to him are both demented and delusional. It is not unreasonable
to say that many of them are suffering from a form of mental illness. If
you think the capitol protests were an insurrection or comparable to a
terrorist attack, you need to be institutionalized. There is no
reasoning or compromising with someone in this condition.

The thing is, of course, is the majority of the ruling class truly
believes they are confronting an invisible army of white supremacists.
If you polled the media, you can be sure that the overwhelming majority
think the protestors are getting off easy. At the same time, they think
the two blacks who killed the Uber driver in DC were given rough
justice, because racism. We live with people who think it is fine for
blacks to murder people, but you cannot question the results of the last
election.

The old civic nationalist response to this is “well we just have to make
sure to vote for the Republicans in the next election.” Even if
conservatives were something other than apologists for their masters on
the Left, it does not change the fact that close to half the country
wants to murder you. They are not going to lose an election and then
think, “Geez, maybe I don’t need to murder that guy with the Trump
flag.” Instead, they are going get even more deranged and murderous.

Again, politics has always been contentious, and the Left has always
thought they were on a holy mission against the forces of evil. The
pretty lie that made it possible to live together was that we all wanted
what was best for the country. Like a couple realizing they no longer
love one another, we have reached the point where we know we can no
longer live with that 20% called the Left. The only possible compromise
is with ourselves, which is just another way of describing surrender.

If there is to be a solution to the current crisis it will come when
enough white people give up on this relationship with the Left. The
people living in whites-only neighborhoods chanting about antiracism are
beyond reason. The people demanding the state torture citizens who
question official policy can never be trusted. The only peaceful
solution is peaceful separation. The only compromise is how best to
divvy up the property and even that is only to expedite the divorce. It
is time to move on.
