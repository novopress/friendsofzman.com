If you were around in the 1980’s and old enough to pay attention to the
news, you remember the debate about the news media. One side, the
conservatives, complained about the media bias against them. The other
side, the liberals, dismissed the claim as something like a conspiracy
theory. For its part, the media spent time trying to prove they were not
biased at all. They would point to the one conservative story in the
back pages as proof they were giving both sides equal treatment.

The funny part about that debate is everyone was right. The
conservatives were right in that self-described conservatives
outnumbered self-described liberals two-to-one, but the media was almost
entirely liberal. The liberals were right in that it was not some sort
of conspiracy to silence conservatives. The media simply reflected the
opinions of the people who were in the media and politics. The media was
being generous to conservatives, given that everyone they knew was a
liberal.

Fast forward to the present and the media is insane. Right now, they are
claiming a Mexican immigrant, who shot up a Texas mall, is a white
supremacist. Here is the Washington Post
<a href="https://archive.is/3RY6d" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">version</a> of this whopper.
<a href="https://archive.ph/NMQ3P" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> is Rolling Stone.
<a href="https://archive.ph/jpS1N" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> is the Daily Bleat hyperventilating over it. Of
course, the volunteer army of regime toadies is uncritically posting
this on social media. The thing missing from all of these stories is a
picture of the shooter, Mauricio Garcia.

Of course, by the time they get around to showing a picture of the
shooter, someone will have doctored the photo to make him look like a
German. The previous Texas spree killer, also a migrant from Mexico, was
whitewashed so he could look the part, but the real photo was soon on
the internet. The media did the same trick with the Uvalde, Texas
shooter last year, then they edited their own news articles when the
fraud was detected, but by that point it was too late.

Texas seems to be having a problem with migrants going on killing sprees
and not just the mass shooting variety. Over the weekend a migrant <a
href="https://www.valleycentral.com/news/local-news/brownsville-police-investigating-major-accident/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">drove</a> into a group of migrants,
killing eight and wounding ten. This does not get the same attention as
the Texas mall shooter, because we are supposed to think it is perfectly
normal for illegal immigrants to drive cars into pedestrians. Sadly, it
is becoming normal as the country is being
<a href="https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1655365862721830912"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">invaded</a> by tens of <a
href="https://twitter.com/EBE6934_13/status/1655296599478919168/photo/1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">millions</a> of migrants right now.

The regime media telling us that brown people are now the face of white
supremacy is just the next click of the ratchet in terms of media
perfidy. Over the last year they told us the Russians bombed their own
pipelines and the Azov battalion, festooned with Nazi iconography, are
freedom fighters. Before that they told us the unvaccinated people cause
vaccinated people to get Covid. Before that, they said Russians used
mind control to alter the 2016 election results.

In other words, there is a pattern here. The lies from the regime have
become more common, but also more outlandish. The crossdresser who shot
up a Christian school was characterized as the victim. Imagine what it
must be like to sit in a room with an editor who is explaining how the
narrative position on the school shooter will be that the little kids
she murdered are to be ignored, while the shooter is the victim. Imagine
that being the new normal in the media because it is.

Lost in the mounting vulgarity is the question at the center of that old
debate from forty years ago regarding media bias. Back then, people in
the media could not see their own bias because from their perspective,
there was no bias. Everyone they knew agreed that the media was playing
it fair. If anything, the media was being too generous to those horrible
conservatives. We are seeing the same thing about the grotesque
dishonesty in the regime media today.

The reason the crew of eight people responsible for that Washington Post
story are willing to post nonsense about the brown guy being a white
supremacist is everyone they know thinks this is obviously true. When
the FBI guy told them on the sly that the shooter was their primary
bogeyman, they had no reason to question it. Normal people would have
laughed themselves silly, but not Post writers. For them, it was
confirmation of everything they know to be true.

Forty years ago, media bias was simply the result of media culture. What
had been a working-class profession came to be dominated by credentialed
professionals from the same upper-middle-class backgrounds. Media bias
reflected the class of people who working in the media. The paranoia and
penchant for wild conspiracies involving fictional bogeymen we are
seeing in the regime media today also reflects the culture of the people
in media. They really believe this stuff.

In fact, it reflects the managerial elite as a whole. These crackpot
tales about Mexican white supremacists are not intended to sway the
public. They do not care about the public, so they do not care about
public opinion. They do care about opinion in the increasingly isolated
elite circles. You can be sure that all of the flunkies, seat warmers
and coat holders in Washington read that Post story and believed it.
They believe because their bosses believe and everyone they know
believes it.

That is probably the hardest thing for normal people to accept. Forty
years ago, conservatives were sure they could talk their liberal friends
in the media out of their obvious bias. Forty years on, normal people
still think the media must know what they are doing is madness. They
have to know it is fake. The truth is, they think these nutty conspiracy
theories and outlandish whoppers are real. Our ruling class is as nuts
as they appear to be, maybe even worse.
