Now that we are starting to get some clarity on how the military
situation in Ukraine is going to play out this year, it is a good time
to contextualize the war, which means understanding the politics of it.
The only way to understand this war is to understand the people
responsible for it and the people responsible for this war and the many
other wars since 1990 are the neoconservatives.

It is a bit ironic that this bizarre cult may meet its end in the place
where their ancestors got their start. Most of the neocons from the
middle of the last century were from parents who emigrated from places
like Galicia, which is currently part of Ukraine, but was part of the
Russian empire a century ago. That part of the world has produced far
more than its share of troublemakers.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Stefan Bandera</a> was from Galicia. He is the
inspirational leader of current Ukrainian nationalists, like the Azov
battalion, which have been fighting Russian militias in the Donbas since
the coup in 2014. Interestingly, many prominent Bolsheviks were from
this part of the world as well. Of course, many of the most important
neocons came from that part of the world as well.

It would be nice if 2023 brought some attention to this bizarre cult of
fanatics responsible for this Ukraine disaster, but these people are
better at avoiding sunlight than they are at starting monstrous wars.
People like Robert Kagan and Victoria Nuland should be brought center
stage and explained to the public. They are responsible for death and
carnage that would make a certain Austrian blush.

The show this week is a primer on these people and their machinations
over the last thirty years with regards to Russia. It looks like this
long bloody history will come to a head this year, which means the
official narrative will collapse. It also means the nationalist
<a href="https://counter-currents.com/2022/12/against-imperialism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">narratives</a> will fall apart as well.
The Ukraine war is about imperialism, but not the sort of imperialism
they imagine.
