The paleoconservative thinker, Sam Francis, developed the concept of
anarcho- tyranny, which is when the state tyrannically regulates
citizens’ lives yet is unable or unwilling to perform the basics of
rule. For example, the government put speed cameras and red-light
cameras up, in order to catch small violations, but if your car gets
stolen, the cops will not bother looking for it. The tyranny is the
micromanagement of the good citizens while driving. The anarchy is
ignoring the car thieves.

It is a great framing because it is both true and easily validated. It
is one of those observations that reminds us that conservatism was not
always a collection of toadies and flunkies validating the latest
Progressive fads. The Right used to have smart and thoughtful men
genuinely concerned with the direction of Western society. They also had
the courage to honestly examine what was happening. In other words, the
current crisis did not sneak up on us like the fog.

Putting that aside, the paleos focused mainly on the management side of
things with regards to anarcho-tyranny. Police departments are an easy
example, but a similar process happened with regulatory agencies, large
corporations, the academy, and the mass media. In fact, they saw these
as tectonic plates of the ruling class that were slowly converging. Of
course, this is what has happened. All of the power centers are occupied
with the same sorts of people.

Something similar seems to have happened to the political class. It used
to be that politicians spent a lot of time pretending to know the issues
so they could connect with their voters. The old expression was that all
politics were local. What that mean was the politicians needed to spend
time among their voters, discussing the issues that concerned them. This
was especially true of representative. Congressman put a heavy emphasis
on being back in their districts.

You do not have to go back to far when it was rare for a politician to
talk about big ideas or abstract concepts. Presidents, when giving
national speeches would blather on about the meaning of America or the
importance of patriotism. The rest stuck to things like making the roads
better, fixing up the schools and helping business. The Democrats would
talk about worker rights, in the context of higher wages. The
Republicans would talk about less regulation so business could succeed.

In the 1990’s, a common thing was the town hall meeting, which was not
really a town hall meeting. It was an expression for when the
representative would show up in his district and take questions from his
voters. This was the chance for the politician to show how much he cared
about the local issues. The way he did that was by having a detailed
knowledge of the facts. If someone asked about the roads, he knew all
the bills and bond issues related to road repair.

This is no longer the case. In fact, the last time you are likely see
your representative in person is when they are running as a challenger.
Once they win office, they become an avatar on-line and on television.
They never venture out among the people and the old town hall idea no
longer exists. For a while they did conference calls, but now they are
staged Zoom sessions with actors asking questions. In fact, Congress
could now be doing its thing on a sound stage in Hollywood and no one
would know.

On top of that, the avatars now talk in riddles. They lurch from one
emotional crisis to the next, speaking about it in a creepy overwrought
language. Minor misstatements are described as “horrendous” and
“terrifying.” The primary feature of our politics now is that every ant
is an elephant, and no one dares speak about the herd of elephants
standing in the room. Anarcho-tyranny in politics results in emotionally
charged drama over abstract concepts and ruthless ignorance of anything
specific.

This is one reason the political class flew into a panic when Trump came
along in the 2016 election. For all his bombast, he was talking about
real things in practical terms that actually matter to people. When he
spoke of immigration, he talked about rapists crossing the border and
illegal aliens killing citizens. Trade was about China ripping off the
country and reducing wages in the process. Trump was a throwback to the
old-style politicians and that terrorized the current politicians.

This is something else the paleos touched on, but never fully explored.
The managerial state not only becomes self-serving as it matures, but it
also becomes inward looking, a self-contained culture. Once it becomes
class-aware, as we are seeing today, it becomes rapidly insular. The
dual purposes are the moral signifiers inside the system and maintaining
the barrier between those inside and those outside. These work in
concert to further isolate the system from the general society.

This is why our politicians sound increasingly deranged. Not sounding
like normal people is very important inside the system. Who they are is
not us, so they are constantly looking for ways to signal that to one
another. This is why they are now barricading themselves into a green
zone in Washington. Most likely, this will begin to happen at the state
level. Americans will be ruled by pod people living and operating inside
special zones guarded by razor wire and armed men.

The last phase of anarcho-tyranny may turn out to look something like
colonial occupation, where the people in charge live in fortified towns.
They use their control of the system to maintain the illusion of power,
but in reality, it is all just a very expensive drama that has no
practical impact, beyond the cost. The practical aspects of life are
handled by corporations and ad hoc associations. Managerialism brings us
full circle to a firm of feudalism with material excess.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
