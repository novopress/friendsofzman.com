One of the selling points of liberal democracy is it is supposed to
create a marketplace of ideas, where the proponents debate their
proposals. Politicians get grilled by an adversarial media on their
positions. Like the market for goods and services, the marketplace of
politics is supposed to weed out the crackpots and zealots, so the
people can choose between sane options. In practice, there is no
marketplace of anything in liberal democracy, just approved positions.

This [Breitbart
story](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/06/07/marco-rubio-shift-hispanic-vote-toward-gop-under-trump-permanent-unless-republicans-revert-pre-trump-ways/)
is a good example. It is an interview with Senator Marco Rubio, who has
been assigned the job of selling an anti-populist message as Trumpian.
It is the old Karl Rove big tent nonsense about needing to sell the
party to nonwhites. Because of what happened in 2016 and 2020, they have
retooled the message. Instead of focusing on Trump’s loss, they are
focusing on their anomalous gains down ticket and crediting that with
the Hispanic vote. It is the new Big Lie.

Now, Rubio is as dumb as a goldfish, so he is never going to question
the script he has been provided by his handlers. He also plays the
Hispanic role well enough for the white people being targeted with this
trick. Of course, he has been reliably open borders and supports endless
wars of choice. You would think the interviewer would mention his fierce
opposition to Trump and his coziness with the neocons, but that never
happens in the highly scripted media environment.

Another bit of nonsense the interviewer did not bother to mention is
that Trump did not do all the well with Hispanics. In 2004, Bush the
Minor got 44% of the Hispanic vote according to studies after the
election. McCain got 31% in 2008 and Romney got 27% in the 2012
election. Trump also got 27% in 2016. In 2020 it bumped up to 31%,
despite four years of pandering to Hispanics. His black support jumped
more than his Hispanic support over the same time.

This is easily obtainable data. Rubio has been making this claim since
Karl Rove stapled a new cover page on his [2012 GOP
Autopsy](https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RNCreport03182013.pdf)
last October, so there has been plenty of time to check the numbers. You
would think a reporter would ask Rubio about the facts, but that is not
how it works. Rubio is there to sell the Big Lie and so is any reporter
granted an interview with him. The whole point of the Big Lie is to keep
repeating it unchallenged until it seems like the truth.

Of course, the point of the Big Lie is to keep whites from noticing what
is happening to their country. That was the real danger of Trump. His
voters could see with their own eyes that everyone at his rallies was
white. His voters were allowed to discuss immigration, trade, and the
endless wars. Trump was a lousy President, but he was a dangerous
catalyst. He got white people talking about and noticing things that
threaten the ruling regime, which is why they hated him.

Another angle to the Big Lie in this case is that it is intended to
separate Trump from the party voters. Taken at face value, the claim
here is that Hispanics liked the Republicans running down ticket, but
not Trump. You see, that is why Trump lost but the party clung to enough
seats to avoid a blowout. The Georgia Senate run-off has been hurled
down the memory hole. The point is to repeat the claim that Trump the
person was the problem, so he has to go.

The fact is, Trump was always the white candidate. His support was over
90% white and he won in 2016 by tapping into disaffected white voters in
states the Republican Party had abandoned decades ago. He was unable to
build on that support in 2020, because he spent four years pandering to
nonwhites. Putting aside the gross irregularities in the election, Trump
failed to deliver to the people who gave him the improbable 2016
election and it hurt him in those key states.

That is the point of the Big Lie. The people behind it are only focused
on one thing and that is preventing white people from noticing what is
happening. The absurdity of having a neocon stooge like Rubio sell the
lie is part of the magic. Whites are supposed to come away thinking
Rubio was won over in the Trump years. After all, how else can you
explain this rabid anti-Trump guy now praising Trump? Why would the
pro-Trump site Breitbart be going along with it?

This is why the Republican Party must be destroyed. It serves no other
purpose than to prevent whites from accepting demographic reality. That
reality is this. About one percent of the GOP vote is black. Another 5%
is Hispanic and another 2-3% is coming from other nonwhite groups.
Generously, ten percent of the GOP vote is from nonwhites and this has
been true for generations. No amount of outreach or wishful thinking is
changing that mathematical reality.

The Democrat Party is the antiwhite party. About 27% of their vote is
from whites, while the rest is from nonwhites. That number continues to
drop. In 2008 whites were 32% of the Democratic Party base. In 2000 it
was 34%. The combination of whites heading for minority status and the
Democratic Party becoming viciously antiwhite is collapsing their white
support. There is a chicken and egg debate here as to whether they are
driving whites out of the party or responding to demographics.

This is ultimately what the Big Lie is intended to conceal. Despite the
painting of Trump as a racist, his support with nonwhites improved. If
he had been clear about whose interests he served, he not only would
have won more white votes, but he would have won more nonwhite votes.
Osama bin Laden was right. “When people see a strong horse and a weak
horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.” That is what the Big
Lie seeks to conceal from the people who need to hear it the most.
