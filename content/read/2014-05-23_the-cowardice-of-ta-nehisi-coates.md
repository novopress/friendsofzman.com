The big Ta-Nehisi Coates case for reparations has finally <a
href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit the web</a>. There is a
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=1636" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">soft case</a> in favor of reparations. By soft case,
that is a general nod in favor the argument of reparations with lots of
qualification. We have tried for at least two generations to relieve a
certain segment of the white population of their unfounded guilt over
slavery and discrimination. The only way to do that is to settle up with
the blacks. We hammer out an agreement, write the checks and close the
books on the issue for good.

The Coates story has been anticipated for a while, since he is the
latest novelty on the progressive circuit.  Right out of the shoot we
get a Biblical quote and a snippet from John Locke. Then the whole thing
falls apart. Instead of making the case for why reparations will solve
the problem, he spends thousands and thousands of words bitching and
moaning about whitey and how rotten it is to be black in America. Anyone
over the age of ten has heard it all before and has no interest in
hearing it again.

It’s not just laziness, it is cowardice. Look, reparations in the
abstract are easy. It is when you get to nut-cutting that things get
tough. How much does each black person get? How do we determined who is
eligible? Who pays? How do we figure that out? More important, how do we
then de-construct the previous efforts at reparations like affirmative
action? That’s tough and it takes skill to make the case. It also takes
a degree of honesty not popular in the comfy lefty confines.

Coates, of course, is really just a grifter. He’s not well read or
educated, but he knows how to game white liberal elites into giving him
stuff. He reads enough to drop references and book titles with some
skill. That pleases liberal whites. He does the authentic black guy bit
by living in Harlem. He’s checking off all the boxed for his
benefactors. This article is aimed at them. It allows them to weep and
wallow in their self-inflicted misery. They get to feel good over
feeling bad about their privilege.

Maybe he lacks the wherewithal to make a sensible argument in favor of
reparations, so maybe that’s part of it. He’s another victim of
affirmative action. Even so, he could make the old black demand for free
stuff. He can’t even do that as the free stuff would have to come from
his Jewish benefactors. That would risk his place on the gravy train, so
he just goes with emotive pap. That’s what makes him a character.
