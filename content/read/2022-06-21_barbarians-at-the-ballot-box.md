For the longest time, the debate over immigration has been about how
both sides can agree on open borders while appearing to disagree. The
Left made the spurious claim that America was the result of immigration.
If immigration declines, then the country will decline. The Right made
the claim that immigrants were natural conservatives and the only way
for the Right to compete in the future was to load up on those
super-duper conservative immigrants via open borders.

Outside of this immigration two-step, race realist would point out that
immigrants tend to support the government party for practical reasons.
In the West, the government party is always a few clicks to the left of
the people and several giant leaps to the left of its heritage
population. In America it means seventy percent of immigrants will vote
for the Democrats, regardless of their policies. The cultural
inclinations of the immigrants will have no impact on their political
activity.

There has always been a cynically pragmatic thread to the immigration
debate centered on the crude reality of politics. The Democrats
supported open borders because it brought them extra voters to exploit.
Their call for more immigration parallels their ballot stuffing
measures. Republicans want more immigration because their donors want
cheap labor. The “cheap labor lobby” theory relies on the antiquated
claim that the business lobby still wears monocles and top hats.

It is starting to look like these claims make sense, but only within the
context of a good economy, stable demographics and a pacified white
population. In the post-Cold War America, the Democrat-Republican
two-step on immigration made a lot of sense for both sides of the dance.
Similarly, the observations of the race realists and cynics played out
in every election. All of sudden, none of this is making any sense
because the logic in which it worked is falling to pieces.

The first bit of logic that is breaking is the economy. When the white
middle-class is doing well, they want their government to be generous.
The government becomes an extension of their moral sensibility. When the
middle-class feels stress, this swings around the other way. Now that
the white middle-class is hitting retirement, that swing is looking
quite dramatic. There is not going to be a lot of sympathy from a group
living on savings when the stock market has lost twenty percent.

There is also another aspect to the changing economy. Airline pilots and
engineers are not floating over the Rio Grande. The sort of people
coming over the border are not bringing anything of value. There is no
shortage of unskilled labor. The real labor crisis in America is in
competency. The real struggle for business is in finding people who can
do skilled work and will want to do it well. Rather quickly, immigration
is no longer an exploitable asset for the open borders lobby.

Another problem for the open borders people is the collapse in
institutional trust that accelerated in the last half dozen years. Trump
was a warning that the people were losing faith in their institutions.
The response by the institutions was to prove the people were correct in
their suspicions. Anything the two parties try to sell is assumed to be
part of some conspiracy to harm the country. The reaction to the latest
gun grabbing by both parties is a perfect example of this new normal.

One other bit of the old structure that has started to crumble. The
ruling elite of America, sensing the “browning of America’ have embraced
*leucophobia*. This is a bigotry toward all things white, driven by a
fear of being white or acting white. The defining feature of the popular
culture the last decade has been a snarling, aggressive war against
white people, especially white men. This pogrom was institutionalized in
the late Trump years as part of the color revolution against him.

This is turning out to be a poison pill for the antiwhites with regards
to the Spanish speaking immigrant population. It is turning out that the
conservatives were sort of right about migrants being naturally
conservative. They were simply wrong about what they naturally want to
conserve. The Hispanic vote does not want to be lumped in with the freak
show the Left has assembled and they are not down with the leucophobia
that has become a standard feature of American life.

The polling over the last year that has suggested a shift in Hispanic
voting is now turning up at the <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">ballot box</a>. Surprisingly, the only
Republican to <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">get</a> that this has nothing to do with
boiler plate conservatism and everything to do with ruling class
degeneracy is Marco Rubio. It turns out that Hispanics are more revolted
than white people by the sight of a man in a dress. They are willing to
vote Republican because anything is better than a crossdresser.

There is a similar dynamic going on with the color wheel. Hispanics have
a much more intimate relationship with blacks in America. They tend to
live near them, often taking over their neighborhoods. Hispanics are
extremely race realist. The effort to lump them in with blacks, as part
of the rainbow coalition is offensive to them. Democrat efforts to make
them a stripe on their flag is turning this block into a collection of
extremely race realist Archie Bunkers.

Politically this is creating an amusing dynamic. One side is demanding
the Hispanics get in the back of the bus with the other BIPOC’s while
the other side is screaming at them about the evils of racism. Hispanics
are about to learn what white people have been learning the last ten
years. That is, they have no voice in politics. Forty percent of the
population is white-wing and no one in either party speaks for them.
Hispanics are about to join the politically disposed.

None of this should be viewed as good news. The Republicans winning a
landslide in the fall elections will only make things worse. Whenever
the people vote the wrong way, the ruling elite forces the Republican
party to punish them. Then there is the prospect of the government being
run by Biden, McConnel and McCarthy. The long simmering Irish question
will finally burst into the open. That and having three morons, one with
dementia, running things can only lead to disaster.

All that aside, there is a late Roman empire feel to this. The ruling
elite, in an effort to conceal their weakness, chooses to settle
barbarian tribes rather than fight to keep them at bay. Rather than
create a constituency for the ruling elite it just adds to the number
not represented in the ruling elite. At some point, the newly settled
barbarians and their new neighbors decide that the new group of
barbarians are a better play and they throw open the gates.
