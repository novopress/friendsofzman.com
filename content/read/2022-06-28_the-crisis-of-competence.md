One of the subtexts to the current war in the Ukraine is the fact that
the West has been wrong about every aspect of the conflict. None of the
predictions about the actual fighting have been correct. Even the
propaganda has been hilariously wrong, often making the West look
foolish. The economic response, which was supposed to be a fatal blow to
Russia, has gone horribly wrong. Europe now faces an unprecedented
energy shortage this fall and winter.

The bulk of the blame lies at the feet of the neoconservatives running
foreign policy for the Global American Empire. The same cast of
characters who were horrifically wrong about Iraq and Afghanistan in the
Bush years have managed to turn a regional issue into a global disaster.
London and Brussels, along with the provincials occupying legacy
positions in national government share blame as well. They
enthusiastically went along with a war plan that had no chance to
succeed.

The degree of wrongness is a thing of beauty, when you can look at it
from a purely objective point of view. Rolling dice, flipping coins or
pulling policy ideas out of a hat would have had a better result. One
could be forgiven for thinking that maybe this series of errors is
somehow deliberate. Maybe that ridiculous bald guy from the World
Economic Forum really is a super villain. The masters of the universe
are setting the West ablaze so they can build back better.

The question that should be pondered is why has everything gone so
terribly long for the collective West? One reason is competence. The
Global American Empire is led by a man who barely knows where he is most
of the time. In his prime, Joe Biden was known as an affable moron. In
his dotage, he is a confused and incompetent old man unable to perform
his duties. His handlers give him stage instructions for basic things
like where and when to sit.

Biden is the bit of the iceberg we see. There is a whole apparatus
around him that was instrumental in getting him into office. The
Washington political community thought a dementia patient was better
than Trump. That says nothing about Trump and everything about the
people who engineered Biden’s ascension. People forget that the
Democratic Party had to rig its own primary to get Biden the nomination.
They never stopped to think what this would mean after the election.

Of course, this degree of incompetence is made possible by a political
culture that is defensive, isolated and insulated. They picked Biden
because he was the safest option to get rid of Trump. Biden’s primary
appeal to the political class was that he was a vegetable they could
move around however they pleased. Biden and his family were simply happy
to fill the role and play their part. He also provided the best chance
of liberating the city from the scourge of Trump people.

That decision gets to the insularity of the political class, not just in
Washington, but across the collective West. These are people without any
understanding of the societies over which they rule. When you look at
the resumes of these people, the common feature is no experience in the
dreaded private sector. Politics has been their life since they were
adults. In fact, we have reached a point where private sector experience
raises suspicion in the political class.

These are people who simply have no idea how things work. They just take
for granted that things work. Like the heirs of a family business, the
political class has spent their life in a system without ever having to
think about how it came into being. The system of power they command is
a permanent feature of life. The only variable is who will have control
of the institutions of power. That is politics, the game of verbal chess
which picks the winners and losers in the system.

Therein lies the other cause of this unfolding disaster. The West is a
collection of people who deal in words exclusively. They have never done
anything, other than talk about making other people do things. Nancy
Pelosi has been in Washington for eighty years and there is no single
physical thing she can point to, other than her ten-thousand-dollar
freezer, as a product of her political career. When she is dead, the
next wave will wash away her footprints in the sand and she will be
forgotten.

On the other side of this fight is a different system, one that is the
result of people doing things and rising in the ranks as a consequence.
Putin is a man who had to navigate a world where failure meant prison or
death. When that world collapsed, he had to navigate a world of chaos.
When he gained power, he then had to impose order, often taking on
powerful oligarchs backed by Western interests. Putin and his ruling
circle are a collection of men who do things, not just talk about
things.

Six months ago, the West was prepared to give the Russians a good tongue
lashing, cancel her from the internet and de-platform her from the
financial system. On the other side, the Russians prepared to fight a
war against a well-armed and prepared enemy in Ukraine and a well-armed
and prepared West on the world stage. One side was ready for a battle of
words while the other side was ready for a battle of actions. It turns
out that words count for a lot less than actions.

All civilizations have periods of incompetence. The Russians suffered
through the Gorbachev and Yeltsin periods. The difference for the West
is that the system has been selecting for bourgeois obsequiousness for a
long time. The reason Washington is run by fossils is the next in line
is much worse than the geezers. Mitch McConnell knows something about
running the party. Kevin McCarthy was selected because no one in power
worried that he would be a challenge.

The crisis of the West is that it is now run by a managerial class that
was selected for being the teacher’s pet, ticking the right box on a
form and making sure to never utter a discouraging word around the boss.
It is why presidents have been increasingly ridiculous since the Cold
War. Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden are all mileposts in the
decline of competence. Next up is Kamala Harris, an absurd manifestation
of a system that selects against competence.
