Anyone who has spent time in a large corporation has lived through at
least one period of downsizing, the modern way of saying layoffs.
Revenues fall short, so management scrambles to bring costs in line with
the new reality. It starts with getting rid of symbolic things like
pizza Friday and the company picnic. That never works so the next step
is a series of layoffs to “right size” the staff. The British have a
great term for this. They say people have been made redundant.

One of the things people often notice about these periods of mass
redundancy is that the redundant are also superfluous. That woman who
was in every meeting and handed out reports once a month is now gone. No
one is asking for her reports or struggling to produce her reports in
addition to their own. The reports simply stopped being produced and her
chair in the meeting is now empty. It does not take long before no one
remembers her name or her job description.

Those who have some years under their belt know that corporate bloat is
just one of those things that infects every large company. Even after a
company goes through one of these periods, it does not take long before
it begins to re-bloat. Profits return, the economy looks better and
people start thinking outside the box again. The empty cubicles begin to
fill up with nice people who maintain spreadsheets that everyone thinks
are vital until the next time there is a downsizing.

In the dreaded private sector, bloat is constrained by the need to make
a profit, but in the public sector there is no such constraint.
Universities are so bloated with administrators it is hard to find the
faculty. Ideally, a university has one administrator for every three
faculty members. This is a well-known metric. At least it was well-known
until the explosion of administrators happened. Now most public
universities have close to three administrators for every faculty
member.

In government, the number of people who do essential work is too small
to measure, so the ratio of managers to workers is impossible to state.
Even in government, dividing by zero is not allowed. This has crept into
the private sector through the door of government contractors. The
reporting required to work on government programs requires an army of
those nice people who sit in cubicles producing snappy spreadsheet
reports that no one reads.

Even in something like military procurement bloat is an issue. One of
the things that is becoming clear with the war in the Ukraine is that
the United States has a massively bloated military industrial complex.
They just assumed this was true for the Russians, which is why they
assumed Russia would run out of munitions by now. It turns out that
Russia “right-sized” their military industrial complex a long time ago
so now they can produce much more for much less than the West.

When you step back and look at the American economy as a whole, it is
clear that bloat is the way to describe it. It is packed with jobs that
have no real reason to exist, other than the rules created by managers.
Most people do work that has no utility other than it ticks some box
somewhere in the system. It may be a big
[reason](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools)
for why people are dropping out of the workforce. Sitting in a cubicle
all day doing busy work is not worth the paycheck for many people.

This may be a clue as to where managerialism ends. The Soviets followed
a similar path that eventually led to collapse. After the revolution and
civil war, a new class began to emerge that took control of the system.
First it was party members gaining control of important parts of the
country. Then the party itself became the primary mechanism for running
the system. After the war and the death of Stalin, this new class
exploded to take control of the Soviet Union.

It has been forgotten, but there was a tremendous amount of optimism in
the USSR after the war into the 1960’s. Experts were building and
rebuilding the Soviet economy along scientific lines. Many people, even
in the West, thought that maybe the communist would catch or even
surpass the West economically. That collapsed with the overthrow of
Khrushchev. The experimentation and optimism were replaced with dull
technocratic conservatism. The managers were back in charge.

That is the way to think about the last twenty-five years of the USSR.
It was a lot like the American car makers in the 1970’s. The lack of
competition meant that all the bad habits of the managers went
unchecked. Before long, the workers stopped caring because why would
anyone care when the bosses do not care? By the end of the Soviet era,
the Russian economy was festooned with people who produced reports no
one read and attended meetings where nothing was decided.

There are lots of theories for why the Soviet Union collapse, but one
reason is simply that it became bogged down in corporate bloat. The
system got so gummed up with layers of managers looking for something to
do or looking for a reason to not do anything that the system itself
began to seize up. By the end, a country with vast fertile farmland was
struggling to feed itself. Events like Chernobyl were embarrassing
emblems of a system that are reached its logical end.

The Global American Empire may be near that same point. The liberal
democratic system of the empire is purpose build for war. It was created
in war and has been at war with the world for generations. It should be
incredibly good at war. Instead, it is on the verge of another
ignominious defeat, this time in the Ukraine. A system so bogged down
with empty suits and cubicle jockeys that it cannot do the thing for
which it was designed is not a system with a long future ahead of it.

The one thing unique about America that the Soviets lacked is the
ability to create massive amounts of money from thin air. This covers a
lot of sins, but that may be coming to an end as well. Once it is no
longer feasible to print up enough cash to pay the growing managerial
class, downsizing is inevitable. Unlike a company, the managers of this
system are not going to exit the premises quietly. Downsizing in
countries tends to be chaotic and violent.

One final point of comparison between this age and the dynamics in a
corporation is the lack of institutional memory. Many have noted that
this age bears a striking resemblance to the 1970’s. One reason for that
is the people in charge today have no memory of that time, even though
most were alive back then. Just like a company never remembers the last
downsizing and starts to re-bloat the ranks, the managerial system never
seems to learn from past errors.

Again, the war in the Ukraine is a good example. Backing a puppet
government in a civil war never turns out well. The defining event of
the current political class was the war in Vietnam, yet they appear to
have learned nothing from it. Management induced amnesia seems to be a
feature of managerialism. Like puppies, everyone lives in the moment,
excited about the next thing. No one can see disaster coming, because no
one seems to remember what happened yesterday.

The old line about bankruptcy attributed Hemingway probably applies to
the dynamics within the managerial system. Everyone was surprised by the
collapse of the Soviet Union, even the people inside it. In retrospect
it made sense. The system was going bankrupt a little at a time. Even
though that should have been obvious, few people predicted it. In all
probability, the same fate awaits the West. First it will be the
satellite countries and then the empire proper.
