**Note:** This is the time of year to be generous to those in need, so
if you are looking for a place to give,
<a href="https://www.givesendgo.com/McMichaeldefense" rel="noopener"

but for those who do not

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you live near a public tennis court, you may have noticed that there
are not that many people playing tennis these days. Many courts have
simply been abandoned to nature, due to a lack of interest. Depending
upon where you live, you may see people playing pickleball, which has
nothing to do with pickles. It is a game that is something like ping
pong, except the players are on the table. They use paddles and a
plastic ball, taking turns hitting the ball back and forth over a net.

According to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball#History"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">wiki page</a>, the game was invented as a
way to give kids something to do when they were bored. Over time it
caught on around the neighborhood and soon it was becoming a thing.
Recently the sport has caught on in a big way with tournaments and
leagues around the country. It is very popular with Baby Boomers,
because they can play the game while stationary. They just bat the ball
back and forth to get some exercise and socialize with friends.

This is a bit ironic. Fifty years ago, tennis went from being a rich
person sport, like polo and golf, to something of a national craze. In
the 1970’s big tennis matches were must see television and the stars of
the game were household names. Baby Boomers were young and fit, so they
could play tennis. Then father time made tennis much less enjoyable and
tennis went into decline. Fifty years later the Boomers are back on the
court but playing pickleball instead.

It is hard to overstate the warping effect the Boomer generation has had
on the American culture. The tennis to pickleball phenomenon is one
example, but all of sports has been changed by the Boomers. Through most
of the twentieth century, sports attendance was light, but then the
Boomers got into sports and suddenly going to games was a thing.
Hundreds of billions have been spent over the last half century creating
sports arenas for the Boomers.

Of course, standing outside for three hours is tiring on the old back
and knees, so sports attendance is in decline. College football, which
is a quintessential Baby Boomer pastime is seeing a <a
href="https://www.si.com/college/2020/01/10/college-football-attendance-decline-ncaa"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">collapse</a> in attendance. All of sudden
the people who make a trip once a year to catch a game at their alma
mater are finding a reason to watch the game from the comfort of the
recliner. They can stay in touch with their old classmates on Facebook,
so why make the trip to the game?

The decline in attendance is a serious threat to the college model
because the infrastructure for this industry relies on donations from
alumni. The rich donor wants his friends to see his name on the sports
building. He wants his friends to party with him in the luxury suite. If
all his friends are at the Villages watching the game on television,
what is the point of writing the check? This is why those sagging
attendance numbers have colleges in a panic.

Golf is another sport feeling the Boomer decline. This is the sport for
the white suburban middle manager. Three decades ago, there were a lot
of these people and they filled up golf course around the country.
Demographics and the actuarial tables are thinning the ranks and so the
number of golfers declines every year. Those little brown guys swimming
over the Rio Grande may be natural conservatives, but they will not be
taking up the game of golf any time soon.

This decline in participation will mean a decline in interest. Twenty
years ago, the big names in sports talk radio were known throughout the
culture, because tens of millions of people listened to these guys while
at work. The core demographic for these shows was white men between the
ages of 25 and 55. That demo is now in steep decline and the
listenership is following them. <a
href="https://barrettsportsmedia.com/2022/02/07/barrett-sports-medias-top-20-national-sports-radio-shows-of-2021/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is a list the top sports talkers
and you probably recognize none of them.

What all this points to is a looming winter for sports entertainment.
Some sports like the NFL have been gaming the cable system to tax the
public for their product, but that model is facing the same demographic
collapse. The grandparents still have a cable subscription, but their
kids most likely cut the cord and their grandkids will never have a
cable subscription. That assumes the grandkids even exist, which is
highly unlikely according to the census.

The decline of the Baby Boomer generation was always going to bring a
decline to the leisure industry, but the demographic decline promises a
depression. Many will wonder why they should care, but the sports
entertainment industry is driven by the same economic principles as the
rest of the economy. Those billion dollar stadiums and multibillion
dollar franchises are leveraged to the max. It all assumes a growing
audience of middle class white people.

You can probably do this same exercise with other parts of the economy.
How will the legal rackets maintain themselves when the law schools are
forced to drop the LSAT requirement in the name of equity? A courtroom
like <a
href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=YYG5YGQNPZk&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a> is amusing, but it is no way to
keep the ambulance chasers in business. Even if the standards do not
collapse, the legal profession is about to experience a great die off.
Soon, simple cases will take years because of the lack of bodies.

It is easy to overstate things, but the country is about to undergo a
demographic revolution, and this is before the Great Replacement
discussion. All of the things that relied upon a massive number of
suburban white people are going to find they lack the people to maintain
the old model. The number of suburban whites as customers is in decline
and the number to do the work is in decline. Sports entrainment is the
canary in the coal mine and the canary is dead.
