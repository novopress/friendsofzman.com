For my generation, I’m rather tolerant of homosexuals. For instance,
thirty years ago I hired a flaming homosexual, over the objections of
others. I was not making a point. He was simply the best qualified by a
long shot and that trumped whatever squealing and hissing that would
surely follow. He turned out to be an able worker and fit right in with
everyone, even though they were hostile at first. By the standards of
today, however, I’m an intolerant bigot because I don’t want to worship
homosexual males.

Still, even by the standards of the today, our culture is over-queered.
The queer goblet runneth over. I’m so sick and tired of having homos
placed front and center, with demands that I worship their heroic
efforts to find happiness. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story is a good example.</a> I’m not
a fan of country music. The old stuff was good, but the new stuff is
just bad rock music. It’s not my thing but the normal people living in
the cultural valley like it. But, the Cult can’t let them have it. Nope,
they have to bring the gays into it.

*Church, pickup trucks and dive bars — the imagery of classic country
songs evokes “traditional” small-town American life. Now a rising number
of openly gay crooners are testing just how inclusive that vision can
be.*

*Two prominent singers came out of the closet within hours of each other
on Thursday. Ty Herndon, who rose to stardom in the 1990s with both love
ballads and Christian songs, declared himself to be an “out, proud and
happy gay man.”*

*Herndon, who at 52 has been married twice to women, said that he had
struggled since his childhood to come to terms with his sexuality.*

Well, “Ty” I have been struggling for years with my intolerance of
homosexuals. I’m now out and proud as a normal man who has had enough of
the queers. Time for you guys to go back to the rest stops and public
rest rooms and leave the rest of us alone. Enough.
