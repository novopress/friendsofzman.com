A clever way to make smart predictions is to start with the assumption
that the near future is not going to be much different from the present.
Current trends will extend out over the near term. On the other hand, if
you want to get a lot of attention for yourself, you can make bold crazy
predications that confirm deeply held suspicions. “Next year we see
hyperinflation!” will get the gold bugs and Fed watchers excited.
Everyone likes to hear that their dreams will come true in the coming
year.

The trouble with either of those approaches is they are not motivated by
the desire to figure out what may be coming in the new year. Sure, most
things will probably be the same as last year, but so what? What matters
is what will be different. Similarly, pretending the Great Pumpkin will
rise from the pumpkin patch and finally deliver on his promises is just
cheap theater. So, with that in mind, let us cut open the goat and read
what the entrails tell us about the coming year.

The signs say chaos is coming for the political class in 2022. The
administration’s half-hearted effort to tamp down the Covid panic will
be met by shrieking from the Covidians and much of the media. This is
where we start to see some deep fissures in the coalition as many are
tired of the restrictions while others cannot let it go. This will lead
to criticism of the administration from some on the Left and a
corresponding bit of return fire from the inner party.

Adding to the chaos will be the collapse of all support for Kamala
Harris. She never had a constituency in the party and the prospect of
losing the House and Senate means they need to get a replacement done
before the election. The fact is Biden is in rough shape so the question
is who will pick his successor. The inner party will make this a central
part of the fall campaign. They hope the new heir apparent will get
their people energized and take people’s attention away from the
economy.

The fall elections go poorly for the Democrats. They lose over thirty
seats in the House, but the result is not a landslide as many whites sit
out the election. The icy hand of demographics begins to show up in
formerly safe republicans areas. The Democrats take the loss as an
opportunity to force Joe Biden to resign. His deteriorating condition
and his successor secured, leads to a coordinated push to have him
retire from office after the new year, allowing his successor to run for
two terms.

I will finally escape Lagos.

The instability of the imperial leadership begins to show up globally.
Ukraine experiences civil unrest, especially in the east. The Turkish
economy collapses and we see widescale protests against the government.
Israel decides now is the time to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Ethiopia collapses into chaos because Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy
Ahmed overplays his hand in peace talks with the Tigrayan rebels. As a
result, east Africa collapses into famine and civil war.

I finish my book and I become more popular than Jesus.

Back on the home front, first quarter inflation comes in much hotter
than expected, forcing the Fed to speed up their tapering schedule. Food
prices show the biggest rise as the phrase “fertilizer shortage” enters
the conversation. As the Fed begins to raise rates for the first time in
a generation, equities decline 20% in what the media will tell us is a
natural correction. Bitcoin will lose 50% of its value as governments
tighten the rules on digital assets and their platforms.

The combination of Covid chaos and economic troubles will result in the
first signs of right-wing unrest since the 2020 election. Fueled by
anticipation of another stolen election, populist groups will organize
public rallies in DC. The FBI, of course, will play their role but
thanks to awareness of their shenanigans, these rallies will be full of
people with cameras looking for FBI infiltrators. Finding the
infiltrator will be the most popular internet game in 2022.

Everyone at Reason magazine will come out as trans and no one will
notice.

Conservative Inc. begins to show some serious problems as the decline of
their donor base begins to accelerate. Some of it is driven by the
actuarial tables but most of it is the increasing realization that
conservatism is just a money pit. This will correspond with an uptick in
support for populist and dissident operations. Grifters like Ben Shapiro
and Charlie Kirk to become more populist in their rhetoric. Even Trump
will start attacking the conservative establishment again.

On the media front, we see a wholesale reorganization of cable news. CNN
shifts to a pure news model, dropping their entertainment shows. MSNBC,
responding the Tucker Carlson-ization of Fox, begins adding left-wing
populist content, retiring many of their current personalities in favor
of left-wing YouTube personalities. The collapse of conservative talk
radio will accelerate as that audience ages off and people simply stop
listening to terrestrial radio in general.

Happy New Year!
