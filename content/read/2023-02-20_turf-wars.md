------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the political heyday of Conservative Inc., back in the Bush years,
Karl Rove would speak about the benefits of “big tent” conservatism. The
main upside was that it provided a winning coalition politically. This
not only gave the people controlling it power, it made it easier for the
coalition they assembled to ignore their differences, as there would be
plenty of goodies for everyone. This was the theory behind the FDR
coalition that ruled politics for half a century.

The Rove argument never held together for the simple reason that most of
the people in this new coalition were never going to get anything. They
were being lied to by the neoconservatives who seized control of the
conservatism. Their singular quest was to use the American empire to
further the long term goals of the neocons. This became clear in the
Bush years where we got pointless wars of choice, a massive expansion of
government and the creation of a police state.

That said, there was some bit of truth in the Rove claim. A successful
political movement is always making compromises with itself. Regardless
of the types of politics, practical necessity means cutting corners when
it comes to ideology. The communists figured this out after they gained
control of Russia. This means there is always going to be tension
between the true believers and the ambitious. Success is what allows
both sides to look past these differences.

Again, this was true with the communists in Russia. When they were
easily crushed by the tsarist system, they spent their time squabbling
with one another. When the tsarist system began to wobble and victory
became a possibility, the various factions of Russian communism came
together to fight the system. The Bolshevik coalition held together
through the resulting civil war. Once victory was achieved, the factions
began to go at one another.

There is much more to it than that, of course, but the point is that
winning and the prospect of more winning can keep opposites attracting.
Logically, losing or the dim prospects of winning will highlight the
differences. That is what we are seeing inside the conservative
industrial complex. The array of ideological groups is starting to turn
on one another as their prospects dim. Faced with a shrinking pie and a
growing threat from outsider politics, they are turning on one another.

For example, we have this <a
href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-bronze-age-pervert-seduced-right-wing-thought-leaders"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the submissions editor of
National Review Online attacking the Claremont people. The first thing
to note is the post was published in the far-left conspiracy site *The
Daily Beast*. The cozy relationship between people in the conservative
ecosystem and the people they claim to oppose has always been a tell,
but this is like satire of that old dynamic. If NRO was anything like it
claims, Jack Butler would have been fired immediately.

The other thing to note is that the post is supposed to be a rant
against the internet character Bronze Age Pervert, but it is an effort
to purge Claremont. This may explain recent behavior of some Claremont
people. Behind the scenes, where money changes hands and the donors do
their best Randolph and Mortimer Duke impressions, a decision has been
made to do something about Claremont. Jonah Goldberg’s flunky Jack
Butler is playing the Billy Ray Valentine role.

Alternatively, the yesterday men of National Review may simply be going
to their Trotskyite roots and taking a shot at the winners of the
internal power struggle within the conservative entertainment wing.
Claremont did not roll out a real person to respond to this attack and
instead used an internet character. This <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/02/18/why-bap-not-national-review-appeals-to-the-young-right/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> at American Greatness is mostly
laughing at the ridiculousness of that Butler post. He restates the
dissident case against conservatism made a decade ago.

In fairness, this spat is between low ranking parties in the
conservative industrial complex and may not reflect what is happening
inside it. Both National Review and American Greatness struggle to stay
in business. The former relies on school children to produce much of
their content. the latter relies mostly on unpaid volunteer writers to
produce its content. Their respective not-for-profit operations take in
a few million per year according to their tax returns.

In comparison, the neocon outfit <a
href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/American_Enterprise_Institute"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Enterprise Institute</a> takes
in over $100 million per year and has its tentacles wrapped around the
Republican Party. Similarly, The
<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Heritage_Foundation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation</a> takes in over
$100 million and remains the primary engine for Reagan nostalgia in the
system. Then you have the left-libertarian
<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Cato_Institute"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cato Institute</a> that takes in $30
million to promote globalism. In other words, two pipsqueak operations
beefing with one another is a tempest in a teapot.

The billion dollar thicket of not-for profits that controls the
conservative ecosystem remains unified in its opposition to the people
they claim to represent. In other words, at the top of the system, the
three legs of conservatism remain on reasonable terms with one another,
mostly sharing the same donors. Endless war (AEI), liberal
internationalism (Cato) and romance for a long lost past (Heritage)
continue to hoover up cash to animate the shuffling husk of
conservatism.

Even so, the turf wars between the low ranking soldiers of conservatism
suggest the system has far deeper problems than personal squabbles among
some of the circus freaks they put on stage. The institutions that
control funding of conservative operations are now clearly suffering
from Pournelle’s Iron Law of Bureaucracy. These operations care only
about hoovering up as much cash as they can in order to keep the
leadership of these groups in the lifestyle they think they deserve.

This is why they failed to thwart the Trump insurgency in 2016 and why
they are struggling to produce a coherent alternative for 2024. The
slobbering over Nikki Haley and Tim Scott suggests they have learned
nothing. It is also why they have failed to coopt ideas and people from
the dissident space. A guy like Bronze Age Pervert should have been easy
to crush or corrupt, but the system is now too sluggish and stupid to
handle such tasks. It is a fighter past its prime.

All of that said, we are a long way from see the collapse of
Conservative Inc., even as its influence fades to black. Even so, it is
encouraging to see it pick fights with itself, as it confirms it is
entering the end stage. From the dissident perspective, this dispute
between Team Claremont and Team Buckley is like seeing your ex-wife
drive your new Mercedes over a cliff. You hate to see BAP get singled
out for extra treatment, but the bigger picture makes it tolerable.
