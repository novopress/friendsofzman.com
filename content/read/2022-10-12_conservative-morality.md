One of the great tricks conservatism plays on normal people is to offer
up a set of false choices in response to regime morality. The ruling
class comes out with some new thing and conservatives come out with new
responses. One choice is something the regime has declared a fatwa
against, while the other choice is allowed. The job of the conservatives
is to herd their people into the acceptable choice. Often, the
acceptable choice is just an extreme version of what the regime offers.

The best example is racism. Way back in the last century, elements of
the ruling class invented a new sin called racism. For most of human
history, everyone just accepted the fact that people were different and
people liked to be around their own. This was so obviously true no one
had to think much about it. The exception was when one group of people
tried to move into the area of another group of people. Invasions always
led to violence, which is why invasions were immoral.

For reasons no one bothered to explain, elements of the ruling class
decided that it was immoral for you to want to live around people like
you. Further, you were not allowed to notice the differences in people.
That was this new thing called racism. For several generations now,
conservatives have been trying to prove that the Democrats are the real
racists. You see, the greatest conservative principle is opposing racism
more than the people conservatives claim to oppose.

This desire to be more of whatever the regime is promoting infects
everything nook and cranny of the conservative mind. When the regime
decided sodomy was a sacrament, conservatives celebrated sodomy. When
the regime decided men in dresses could stalk your children in the
playground, conservative suddenly discovered a new sacred <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">principle</a> in favor of crossdressers.
To be a conservative is to fully embrace every degenerate moral claim of
their alleged opponents.

Here is a <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/will-the-supreme-court-end-affirmative-action/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">good example</a> of how conservatism is
just the extreme version of yesterday’s moral claims by their opponents.
The Supreme Court is looking at two cases related to freedom of
association. *Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows
of Harvard College* and *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v.
University of North Carolina* challenge the race policies of their
respective defendants. In both cases, the schools discriminate based on
race.

What the regime has always argued is that white people have dominated
the world due to dumb luck and their unique cruelty. Whether it is the
exploitation of resources held by nonwhites or simply good fortune,
Europeans have unfairly outperformed the rest of the world and this is
immoral. Therefore, it is required that current white people be made to
suffer in order to balance the scales. This is the moral claim made in
all policies under the umbrella of *restorative justice*.

One way to even the scales is to force whites to accept nonwhites into
their lives so that the nonwhites can partake in the good fortune of
whites. In education, for example, the underlying assumption is the
teachers in white schools do a better job teaching their subjects than
the teachers in nonwhite schools. The proof is Asians, who prefer white
schools over black schools. Asians do very well, so it must be that
special magic that exists in white schools, but not in black schools.

In the middle of the last century, a natural right enjoyed by all humans
since the dawn of time was stripped from Americans. You no longer had
the right to place your body next to another body without permission
from the state. Further, you no longer had the right to deny nonwhites
access to your life. Effectively, what was done is the forging of a new
right possessed only by certain nonwhites. That right is the right to
access white people and the things they create.

The rational opposition to this is that all people, even white people,
have a right to make the most of their talents. Therefore, they have the
right to work with whomever they think is in their best interest. This
is a foundational argument of Western liberalism and the basis for
market economics. Since you own you and have the right to use your labor
as you see fit, it naturally follows that you have the right to
associate, or not associate, with whomever you choose.

Conservatives do not make that argument. As you see in that post, their
argument is that you have no rights whatsoever. You are not even allowed
to notice that people are different and posses different qualities.
Instead, in order to be even more berserk about race than the most
berserk member of the new religion, you have to poke out your eyes and
rip off your ears. The conservative principle with regards to the human
condition is to be to the extreme left of the new religion.

Of course, the moral position here is that Harvard, a private college,
can discriminate however it pleases with regards to admissions. If they
want a freshman class of left-handed Korean midgets, they can only admit
those people. On the other hand, North Carolina is a public university
and as such must admit students according to a set of rules applicable
to all American citizens. That would also bar them from favoring
legacies and potential sports stars in admissions.

You see, while we human beings and citizens enjoy the absolute right of
free association, our government does not have that right. Otherwise, it
is not our government and is instead an occupying force. Foundational to
liberal society is free association and that means we collectively own
the state. As equal partners in the state, the state cannot favor one
group over another. Again, equality before the law is a bedrock item in
a moral society.

The writer of that post is probably a decent sort. He wants to do the
right thing, but he has been conditioned by conservatism to think the
right thing is always the most extreme version of whatever the liberals
are peddling. It is so ingrained in the conservative mind that they do
not notice it. If the liberals suddenly favored wearing colorful jock
straps on their heads, conservatives would be boasting about how their
new headgear is the best ever.

The result of this madness is the courts will now decide if the state
has a right to discriminate against white people or no one has a right
to discriminate against anyone for any reason at all. Given the makeup
of the courts, the most likely result will be to ban the most basic
right of free association. In effect, the new rule will render citizens
as prisoners in a permission state. Conservatism will have made
otherwise free people into servants of the managerial state.
