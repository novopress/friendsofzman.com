One of the things I don’t like about taking time away is that it seems
to take me almost as long to get back into the swing of things. I get
back from vacation with things stacked up from before I left and I’m not
in the right frame of mind yet to get anything done. By the end of that
first week back, I feel like I need another vacation, because I’m
working twice as hard to get half the stuff done. I’m really looking
forward to the weekend so I can get caught up on everything and get back
to my normal schedule and routine.

When you travel, you learn things, but not always what you expect. For
example, I got to spend time with Ed Dutton, the English anthropologist
who teaches at the University of Oulu in Finland. He mentioned in
passing that I have an odd voice, by which he meant different from most
Americans. Some others said the same thing, which still puzzles me a
bit, but I suspect it is just a European thing. They have certain
expectations for how Americans should sound and I fall outside of that
set of expectations.

I must admit though, it is a strange thing to be halfway around the
world and have someone comes up to you and say they recognize your
voice. We live in amazing age in many respects. People in our thing all
over the world can communicate with one another over the internet to
such an extent we don’t think much about it. I have listeners in
Estonia, which is amazing when you stop and think about it. To think
this connectedness is not having profound changes on human society is a
major mistake.

Another bad thing about the first week back is spring time has hit
Lagos, which means tons of pollen in the air. I’ve never had allergies,
but when I moved here some local shrub must not sit well with me, as I
have a week every year where my throat feels like sandpaper and my eyes
are irritated. This is that week, so I may sound ever odder than normal.
I tried to tinker with the audio to clean it up, but that never turns
out well, so there are a few stretched where the audio is not as good as
it should be.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
