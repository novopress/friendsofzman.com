I did not start out this week with a theme for the show, but one sort of
developed as I set about putting it together. My habit is to mail it in
the first week after a break from recording, so I can ease back into the
routine. A one hour show is two hours of recording and two hours of
editing. Research adds to the time. A show based on news items requires
less research, so it is an easier show to put together.

The news of late has been dominated by a few big items, all of which are
driven by the ruling class commitment to their narratives. As a result,
the show this week is about how the Cloud People are living in a
simulation. Their reality is not only not our reality, but rather an
approximation of it. If you imagine the Cloud People playing a live
action role plating game of real life, their rantings make more sense.

They just had Mumbly Joe slur through a speech on Covid that sounded
like it was given by an alien in another universe. This great emergency
he thinks is happening outside the bubble is not happening at all. For
most of the country, life is back to normal, except for the annoying
interference of these idiots. Team Dementia, however, is sure the
peasants are living through a version of the Black Death.

The thing is, they probably sense that it does not exist, but they need
it to be real so they pretend it is real. It feels better to imagine
themselves defending their democracy from Covid that to see themselves
as wreckers cause the food prices to shoot through the roof due to their
meddling. Reality avoidance is a major concern for the Cloud people, so
they are fully committed to their own narratives.

For the intensely on-line, this simulated reality crowds out their daily
reality. In the case of Covid, the Covidian believe all of the Covid
porn that the system beams at him on-line and through the mass media.
The reality he sees is not the normal activity around him, but the
imaginary hospitals overrun with sick people. He is like someone
addicted to video games, struggling to discern fantasy from reality.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
