The news brings word that <a
href="http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/norman-lear-all-in-the-family-jeffersons-reboots-1201944546/"
target="_blank">Hollywood is planning to “reboot” some hit TV series</a>
from the olden thymes. Shows like *All In The Family*, *The Jeffersons*
and *Good Times* are on the drawing board for new versions. Presumably
there is a market for 1970’s nostalgia, although the people old enough
to remember those days are getting long in the tooth. If you were an
adult in the heyday of these shows, you’re past 60 now. Perhaps the
children or grandchildren of these people suddenly have a taste for
these old programs.

Or, maybe it is time to retcon the 1970’s.

It’s not hard to imagine how this will go. *All In The Family* will
feature a mixed race family, where the patriarch is a transgender white
man. Gloria will be a gay male and Meathead will be a gender fluid
lesbian, who enjoys lifting weights. *The Jeffersons* will be the same
show, but not funny, because nothing has changed for black people since
the ’70’s and that’s not funny. *Good Times* will have Amy Schumer and
Seth Rogan forced to live in a tenement owned by Donald Trump and
managed by Richard Spencer.

The truth is, those descriptions are far too conservative. People who
watch a lot of television probably just filter out the endless
proselytizing, but that’s pretty much all TV is these days. It is an
endless stream of agit-prop. The mere fact that Amy Schumer can get work
on television says the people in charge hate their customers. According
to the ads, there is a show called Samantha Bee, where a middle-aged
prude screeches at a camera for an hour every night. Why would anyone
make such a show?

The sudden interest in the 70’s by the crazy liberals who run Hollywood
could simply be a bit of cosmic humor. The last great Progressive
Awakening started in the early 1960’s and burned itself out by the
middle of the 1970’s. Even though Jimmy Carter is remembered as a dreary
liberal, he was not a darling of the Left in 1976. By that point it was
clear that the Progressives were spent and it was just a question as to
when the normal adults would regain control and begin cleaning up the
mess left by the Progressive lunatics.

Today, we are at a similar spot. Hillary Clinton was the only person the
Left had as an option. Progressives have burned themselves out to the
point where it is a movement run by broken down old geezers. Just as TV
in the 70’s was full of preachy liberals when the country was
increasingly tired of preachy liberals,
<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/come-on-it-s-2015-current-year"
target="_blank">the current year</a> will be filled with despairing
moonbats railing about the current year. Recycling the great liberal
hits of the last period of Progressive decline is a logical starting
point.

The big difference is the current year has cable, streaming and cord
cutting. The Progressive proselytizers in Hollywood cannot rely on a
captive audience. For example, the endless ads for the Samantha Bee show
suggest no one watches it. Why else run all of those ads? A quick search
reveals that her program gets a peak of 700,000 viewers, which would
have got it cancelled immediately in the 1970’s, but today’s subsidies
from the cable monopolies keep these fringe shows on the air, mostly as
vanity projects.

All of this should be viewed as good news for normal people. The fever
appears to have broken and we are heading into a period where the normal
adults take over from the nutters. The Progs will be left to
proselytizing to an increasingly disinterested audience on TV. Unlike
the 70’s, where we had to sit through liberal crap on television, we can
now watch whatever they call the new Top Gear on Amazon or something on
NetFlix. We are, with regards to our video entertainments, spoiled for
choice. That’s ultimately the best antidote to Progressive lunacy –
choice.
