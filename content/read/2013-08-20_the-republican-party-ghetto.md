There are many reason for the ineffectiveness of the Republican Party,
but the primary cause of their failure is they are not a real political
party. Instead, it is the off-Broadway version of the liberal party.
Instead of offering a compelling alternative to the liberal party, based
in real ideological differences, the Republicans assume the liberal
moral order is the correct one. They just try to work within it to
placate different constituencies. Their first instinct is to bend the
knee to the Left. You see it in <a

This is why the Republicans have been called the “stupid party” for
decades. The people in it always make unforced errors. Almost always,
those errors stem from their habit of taking advice from the liberal
party. A Democrat uses a crisis like a hurricane to attack his political
opponents. Republicans use a crisis to embrace their opponents and
concede all sorts of things to them in an effort to make friends. That’s
Chris Christie. He thinks hugging on Obama will score him friends among
the Democrats, but it never does.

This is why the Republican Party always loses. The other guys never
permit one of their own to wander off the reservation. They never excuse
it. They know that only encourages disloyalty. That’s a basic
organizational technique. You enforce all of the little rules
dogmatically and the big stuff takes care of itself. The young
liberal knows he is done for if he does not toe the line. By the time he
gets to leadership, he is invested in the cause completely. So much so
he is willing to ruthlessly impose those rules on the junior guys.

The Republican Party has it backwards. Their junior members are always
competing with one another for who can get a pat on the head from Lefty.
In fact, it is how they rise through the ranks. By the time they become
senior guys, they are invested in nothing but stabbing their fellows in
the back to score points with liberals. The party is like a life boat
and the game is to keep tossing people over the rail to make room for
new people throw off the liberal cruise ship. The result is guys like
Christie becoming Republican leaders.

In 1992, every said pat Buchanan was not electable, even though most
conceded he was right about things like immigration and trade. In 1996,
the argument for Bob Dole over Buchanan and the libertarian Steve Forbes
was electability. In 2000, Bush was electable and he ushered in eight
years of government expansion and endless war. In 2008 McCain was the
electable choice and was crushed by Obama. In 2012, Romney was the
electable guy and it was his turn to lead the party. He lost to a badly
wounded Obama.

That means in the last two decades the GOP is 2-for-5 and their one
winner was a complete loser in terms of policy. If you are a small
government conservative, a social conservative or a libertarian, the
success of the Republican Party means you lose in a slightly different
way than when the GOP loses an election. To people on the Right, and
let’s face it we’re are talking about white people here, politics has
been a heads they win tails you lose proposition for a couple of
generations, maybe even longer.

Frankly, I hope that Christie wins the nomination and gets clobbered by
that old crook Hillary Clinton. The problem we have is that about 40% of
the voters want something not offered by either party. About 80% of
whites would prefer something to the Right of the most extreme
conservative. In America, the GOP keeps these voters in a ghetto, so
they can make deals with the Democrats. The way forward for the American
Right, and again, we’re talking about white people here, is to destroy
Conservatism Inc. and the GOP.
