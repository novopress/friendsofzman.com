**Note:**
<a href="https://schoonercreekfarm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Schooner Creek Farm</a> is in a legal battle with the
corrupt mayor of the City of Bloomington. The city has allowed (probably
encouraged) Antifa street gangsters to harass these people in order to
ruin their business. I met Sarah Dye last winter and she is very nice
person. She and her family are just trying to live and mind their own
business, but they have been set upon by well-funded gangsters. If you
have a few bucks to spare, donate <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> or

Human societies are like ocean going super tankers. They don’t turn
quickly, and their movement seems glacial, but they have tremendous
momentum. That’s how it is with change in attitudes. It is hard to
notice, but then all of a sudden it just seems to happen and the force
of it changes all sorts of other things. We’ve seen that this year. The
Left and their ruling class backers had slowly decided they could no
longer live with us as equals in society. This year that become
stunningly clear.

[Buchanan](https://vdare.com/articles/patrick-j-buchanan-is-our-second-civil-war-also-a-forever-war)
is right in that we are now a divided country that can never go back to
looking anything like what passed for normal in the past. The managerial
class has become class aware and they look at the rest of us as insects.
The oligarchs completely support this view as it enables them to loot
the middle class. Those normal hard working white people the alt-right
types like to dump on are slowly coming to the realization that they are
becoming despised minorities in America.

It will take a while, but change comes slow then quick. That has been
the lesson this year in the managerial class rebellion. They hated us
long before Trump, but as long as we posed no trouble for them they left
us alone. After 2016 that attitude changed and finally we saw it spill
into the streets and the voting system. Now the reaction and realization
is happening on the receiving end of their fury. People who said 2016
was a Hail Mary by the dispossessed were more right than they knew.

Politics will have to change and white people will have to start using
the tactics the unrepresented have used in the past. You see some hints
of it with boycotts of woke companies pushing degeneracy. Those ad hoc
efforts will need to be normalized and formalized going forward.
Boycotting the GOP, for example, will be the last peaceful tactic
available in the political system. If voting only results in more of the
same, then the only logical choice is to stop voting.

That’s the topic for the show this week. It is one of those things that
must become a topic of conversation among normal people. Changing
attitudes takes time and the first step is to normalize the new idea as
something that can be discussed. That’s the first step with boycotting
as a political tool. Whitey is tuned to think voting is the only choice,
so he will need to be re-tuned to think of other options. That happens
with reasonable discussion in everyday life where people talk politics.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
