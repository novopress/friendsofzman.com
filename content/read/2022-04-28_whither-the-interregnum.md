A topic that John Derbyshire and Peter Brimelow have discussed over the
years is the cultural interregnum that existed in the late 1980’s and
1990’s. This was a topic raised in their talks at the inaugural VDare
conference in Berkeley Springs. For a little more than a decade,
starting toward the end of the Cold War and running through the Clinton
years, certain taboo topics could be discussed in public. You could also
take the rational position on these topics without being killed.

For example, Peter Brimelow published his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Alien-Nation-Americas-Immigration-Disaster/dp/0060976918"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> in immigration titled, *Alien
Nation: Common Sense About America’s Immigration Disaster*. The book was
an expansion of an exceptionally long essay he published in National
Review. His essay criticizing immigration policy and warning about the
cultural damage being done by it took up the majority of the space for
that issue. National Review published an anti-immigration special
edition and felt no need to grovel about it.

Around the same time, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray published
the *The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life*.
Not only did they publish the book, but lots of people bought, read and
discussed it. Those alive during this period probably recall that it was
a popular topic of conversation. Murray was actually allowed on
television to frankly discuss the findings. Again, mainstream
conservatives did not ritually denounce the book.

These are two examples of where now taboo subjects were acceptable.
During this interregnum, a wide range of topics and people were allowed
to operate. Jared Taylor, the founder and leader of American
Renaissance, was allowed on television to talk about his views. His
conference was shown on C-SPAN. Here is an <a
href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?110725-1/race-real-us-constitution"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">old clip</a> of Sam Francis speaking at
the conference. Notice the lack of fainting and hysterical demands for
violence against the people in the clip.

Today it is hard to imagine what it must have been like to live in a
country where people could openly debate the topics of the day. One of
the only benefits of the communications revolution is that we now have
easy access to archival video from the time before the crazies took over
the public square. We know there was once a place where adults could
speak freely about difficult topics. The past is a counter to the claims
of the present and operates as a hope for the future.

That is the context in which Brimelow and Derbyshire usually discuss
this. The 1990’s was a peak time for them and the older dissidents. It
was not just the peak years of their personals careers, but a peak for
honest inquiry. The end of the Cold War and the apparent transition back
to normalcy was a hopeful time. Instead of everything organized around a
twilight struggle against communism, the focus of public life could
return to the practical and productive.

There are two questions at the heart of this. Why did this period of
relative tolerance occur and is it possible to return to such a state?
For two decades now the lights have been going out in America and the
West. The former Soviet Union offers more political freedom, because
they have clear rules. The public square in the West is now controlled
by a feckless, emotionally unstable mob that flits from panic to panic,
destroying whatever happens to be in its way.

The answer to the first question is rooted in the past. What appears to
have been an interregnum was actually a continuation of the Cold War
consensus. Maintaining a broad public debate was an essential part of
opposing communism. The West was where people could question the state.
The Soviet Union did not permit public debate or questioning the state.
This consensus carried forward after the end of the Cold War but shifted
to more relevant topics.

Note that the closing of the American mind started with the 2000
election. During the Clinton years both sides of the consensus had to
search around for a reason to exist now that the communists were gone.
One side settled on post-Marx culturalism and the other embraced
neoconservatism. For the former side, white people and heritage America
would be the enemy around which the ruling class would organize, while
the other side wanted Islam to be the new enemy.

You will note that the neoconservatives have produced a new enemy now
that post-Marx culturalism seems to be burning out. The Russia-China
axis will be the new forever enemy around which America must be
organized. The other side seems to be open to this new arrangement,
perhaps sensing that their war on white people is becoming dangerous for
themselves. On the other hand, nostalgia plays an enormous role in
ruling class thinking.

The second question is more difficult to know. The Judeo-Puritan ruling
class that still prevails is a product of the 20th century. Unlike in
Russia, where the old Cold War ruling class was eventually replaced by a
modern one, America and the West remains saddled with a ruling elite
built for a prior age. The American ruling class is sure that it can
only exist if America is organized around some great struggle. It is why
for thirty years they have lurched from one crusade to the next.

On the other hand, reality eventually does prevail. America is now
suffering a shortage of qualified people for high skilled jobs. It turns
out that airplane pilots and engineers are not floating across the Rio
Grande. It also turns out that the cost of racial vengeance is not only
borne by the bad whites. Managerial class whites are now experiencing
the consequences of their reckless misbehavior. This is no way to
organize a society for a new cold war with old foes.

In the end though, the answer to the larger question that looms over all
of this is that for America to become a normal society, it must acquire
a normal elite. Again, Russia provides a useful example. The old
communist elites were able to transition into a new system of rule by
oligarch. The 1990’s was also an interregnum of sorts for America’s old
Cold War foe. The end of that period brought about a return to normalcy
with the rise of a new elite reflective of the new Russia.

This did not happen in America. The cost of winning the Cold War was the
belief among the ruling class that they had no need to change. They were
on the right side of history so the only rational answer was to push
down on the accelerator. For thirty years America has been rocketing
toward the glorious future with a generation at the wheel, high on Cold
War success and cultural narcissism. Unlike Russia, America’s elite has
never had to confront their limitations.

In the long run, the last twenty years may be seen as the slow painful
death of the Cold War ruling elite’s legitimacy. This dark age in
America and the West will be understood as the slow death of an old
power structure. These spasms of illiberal authoritarianism are the
death throes of an old system. From the rubble of elite legitimacy will
rise a new elite and new cultural framework to support them. There will
be a new elite for a new America and a new West.
