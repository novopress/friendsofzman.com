Once you have been on this side of the great divide for a while, you end
up in another place that is not obvious when you first make the journey.
That is, you look on at conventional politics with a bemused detachment.
Since it is obvious to you that it is all theater, you wonder why some
of them put so much effort into the performance. Why does Elizabeth
Warren, for example, feel the need to carry on like the champion of the
little guy over GameStop? What is the point of this charade?

It could be that her script writers and directors have told her there
are tribes on the Left that need to see this show. Maybe they think the
Bernie Bros are starting to wise up about what is happening and need a
booster shot. It is not as if she is going to follow through and do
anything about the shenanigans. Even if she wanted to, she lacks the
authority and she has no influence over those who do have authority. The
SEC and FBI laugh when they hear a politician demand anything from them.

We live in a country where the FBI can manufacture evidence in an effort
to overturn a presidential election and nothing happens. Thus far, one
guy was charged with faking evidence to a FISA court. He confessed, as
he was caught red-handed, but he received less than what drunk drivers
get these days. He is a hero to the Bureau, because he took his pinch
like a man. He kept his mouth shut and he learned the two greatest
things in life. Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth
shut.

In the case of GameStop and the shenanigans surrounding it, the players
are not punks doing small crimes like that FBI stiff. These are shot
callers who bankroll the political system and control the economy. They
already own dingbats like Warren and Ocasio-Cortez, so they have no fear
of them. They probably have them on mute as no sober man would want to
listen to those two for more than five minutes. Their prattling on about
this issue is pointless.

This is the reality that has been brought home over the last decade. The
election of Trump was that last desperate attempt by normal people to
shake some sense into the managerial class, so they would start
enforcing the rules again. Even people on this side of the great divide
held out hope that this would be a wake-up call and the Overton window
would slide this way, allowing for discussion of the root causes of the
current crisis in the American Empire. None of that happened.

All you have to do is look back at posts here from a few years ago. Look
at the comments and you see familiar names holding out hope that the
investigations into the FBI would become a catalyst to reform. Even the
most jaded on this side of the great divide had some hope. Not puppy
dogs and rainbow hope, but the sort that thinks the people in charge
will sense their interests are at stake and they will adjust out of
self-preservation or maybe as a way to gain some advantage.

This is one of those changes for which we have no precedent. All of a
sudden, we have a significant number of people who look at convectional
politics as a joke. Instead of being angry and banging away on social
media or sending off an e-mail to the nearest Republican, millions are
just detaching from it. Outrage theater can only work if people are
engaged in the system. We are in the midst of a great decoupling, where
millions detach from the system and attach to independent systems.

In the past, the political culture provided for both satisfaction and
dissatisfaction with the current policies. Those who were happy would
get to see people inside the system being happy, so they could mimic
them in their happiness, getting the same dopamine hit as if they were
actually benefitting from the policy. Similarly, unhappy people could
find a performer in the system being angry and outraged. They would
mimic that behavior to get the satisfaction of feeling wronged.

Those of us fully decoupled from the system no longer get those
neurological responses from the performers in the system. Their outrage
and gloating strike us as ridiculous and bit absurd. A goofy old dingbat
like Elizabeth Warren barely has comedic value. Watching her is like
watching a 1970’s comic in a denim suit telling Nixon jokes. Similarly,
Ocasio-Cortez is just a reminder of why you are glad you are no longer
on Twitter. Millennial dingbats are a dime-a-dozen.

What we are seeing is a great decoupling. The shuttering of the social
media sites to tens of millions of people breaks the connection. Many
have ended up on Gab, connecting to a different social dynamic. Others
are heading to other places like Telegram, connecting to boutique
communities. Some will no doubt re-attach to Conservative Inc., but
there is not much there to offer the person looking for a way to express
their unhappiness.

The political system that has evolved to this point has counted on
greater and greater engagement at increasing levels of emotion. What
happens when those dials start moving the other way is unknown and
unconsidered. When tens of millions shrug and laugh at the pleas from
Conservative Inc. or mock the phony rage heads from the chat shows, how
does the system respond? Turn up the volume? Send their crazies back out
to poke people with sticks like they did last summer?

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
embracing crypto for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
