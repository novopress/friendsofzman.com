week is mostly about our rulers and their efforts to suppress dissent.
We now live in a country with dissidents and political prisoners. I also
have something on Jason Kessler, the man responsible for the
Charlottesville debacle. Since this is the weekend of the big fight, I
weigh in with some expert commentary and a prediction. The last segment
is the on the title of this episode, The Great Fear.

This week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and
segments from the show. I am now on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis
can listen to me on their Hitler phones.

I have been threatening to stream this to GabTV and I still have not
done it. Maybe this weekend, but whom am I kidding? I will be looking at
some alternatives as well, as platforms that support free speech are not
easy to find.
