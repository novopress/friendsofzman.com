Way back in the olden thymes, I worked in the Imperial Capital. I was
just a kid and that allowed me access to a lot of scuttlebutt. That may
seem odd, but no one has anything to fear from a kid running errands and
doing office tasks. Consequently, the young people, mostly interns and
pages, used to hear and see more dirt than just about anyone else. In
the age of cell phones, that’s probably no longer true.

The thing about people in power is they don’t have a high regard for
rich people. We like to think that the rich run the pols, but it is not
really that way. The powerful of DC live pretty well by normal
standards. The currency of DC is influence. Knowing how the system works
counts for a lot more than money. Knowing who to call will always trump
the ability to stroke a check. Lots of people have money. Few people
know the right number to dial to get things done.

As a result, there’s a degree of contempt for the rich, in general,
amongst the ruling class. The Rodney Dangerfield rich guys who barge in
thinking they can buy their way into the right parties are particularly
loathed by the Ted Baxter set. Even so, the sophisticated classes that
run things in Washington are very good at handling wealthy rubes from
the provinces. They want their money, of course. They just don’t want to
put up with the bullshit that rich people bring with them.

So, they direct them into harmless endeavors. I once had the task of
giving some rich guy and his old lady the tour of a UNICEF office. I
knew nothing about UNICEF, but the congressman I worked for was on their
board, I think. Maybe it was his wife. I was young and earnest looking
so I guess I filled a role in the hustle. It was a long time ago and all
I remember is how flattered the rich people looked. A Congressman’s wife
and her people doting on the rich people made for a good show.

Later in life I figured out that the game was to guide the rich
dumbasses into funding projects that employed friends of the political
class. It was a form of patronage. It was also a way to keep the rich
people from doing something stupid. Think about all of the Hollywood
assholes who get involved in a cause. Most of them can’t count their
balls twice and come up with the same number, but they are loaded and
they have free time. That’s a dangerous combo if they want to “make a
difference.”

That’s what you see with [Bill Gates and his gun grabbing
efforts](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/26/the-nra-pissed-off-the-wrong-nerd-genius.html).
The nitwit who wrote the article is generally clueless, but that’s part
of the game. The Left needs to keep tools like Cliff Schecter toiling in
the fields.

The ballot issue in question, \#594 is largely a nothing initiative. It
requires a background check for private transfers of firearms. This is a
favorite hobbyhorse issue for the crackpots because they think it will
lead to registration and then confiscation.

You see, there’s no way to enforce regulation of private sales without
registration. Registration is the precursor to confiscation. The trouble
is it will never survive court challenge. Imagine needing a permit to
post comments on the Internet. That’s how the courts will treat this
measure.

The bigger problem for the gun-grabbers is that [another initiative on
the
ballot](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/16/us-usa-firearm-measures-idUSBREA3F1XL20140416)
would forbid background checks and it has broad support as well. But,
some low-level flunkies get a paycheck for a while courtesy of rich
suckers like Bill Gates. That’s what counts.
