target="_blank">This post from NRO’s Mona Charen</a> is a good example
of how the distance between the Buckley Conservatives and the
Progressives has narrowed to the point where it is hard to see any light
between them.

It’s funny, but the little bet I made with myself while reading it was
“A bazillion to one says she dares not mention IQ.” I won that bet, of
course, because the subject of intelligence is now a forbidden topic
with the so-called conservatives. The subject of group intelligence, or
even group differences, causes these people to faint. They have fully
internalized the magic of the blank slate so therefore biology is ruled
out of any discussion of human behavior or quantifiable group
differences. Magic is always the go to move.

The fact is, the efforts to get more blacks into college, and out of
college with a diploma, has not changed the fundamentals of group IQ
difference. All the affirmative action in the world is not going to
change this fundamental
reality.<img src="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/retar0%7Bimage0%7D.gif"

lowering of standards at colleges, in order to increase diversity on
campus, just means more people with an IQ of 85 carrying around a
college diploma. It has no bearing on the earnings gap between those
with a 100 IQ and those with an 85 IQ. As everyone in the dreaded
private sector knows, the diploma counts for nothing when the employee
is being evaluated on their work product. Poor work produced by a
college graduate is still a poor work product.

IQ is not the only taboo avoided in this piece. Immigration is also one
of the banned topics with the so-called conservatives.

That paragraph is hilarious for a number of reason. Mona Charen
presuming to speak for the tastes of black women in the mating markets
is laugh out loud funny. There’s also the fact that she confuses income
and wealth. The bigger issue here is the fact that she cannot bring
herself to mention the real reason black males have rocket high
unemployment levels. That’s immigration. Cheap foreign labor and a
willingness to tolerate idle black men, has resulted in lots of idle
black men. This is really not difficult material.

The main reason Buckley Conservatism no longer has a constituency
outside the ruling class is they have accepted all the premises of the
Progressives. They are convinced that all humans are just amorphous
blobs that can be shaped at will. Differences in outcome, therefore,
must be due to society. That rules out the right answer and leaves them
in the same carnival of magical thinking as the Progressives. The only
difference is one side has slightly different incantations and
abracadabra words than the other.
