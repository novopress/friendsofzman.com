I was feeling pretty good about the AFPAC event last weekend, so this
week I wanted to do some stuff related to it. My original thought was to
open with a segment talking about the event itself, but one thing led to
another and it evolved into an overall theme for the show this week. I
found myself with more material than I could cover. Taking a step back
and assessing things is probably a good idea in everything, but in
politics it is highly useful in maintaining a proper perspective on
things.

When I finished up the show, I put on <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tucker-carlson-elizabeth-warren-identity-politics"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tucker Carlson</a> to see what
he was saying about things and he did a bit on Lizzy Warren. It fit
right in with the final segment of the show this week. I disagree with
Carlson’s assertion that identity politics was the cause of Warren’s
madness. That’s just red meat for his Boomer audience. I think the
better answer is that Warren was probably always insane. It’s just that
the structures around her prevented it from expressing itself in public.

What’s happening to our world, I suspect, is something Joseph Tainter
observed about societal collapse. That is, one ingredient essential to
collapse is the lack of a surrounding set of societies that are
connected to the failing one. For a failing society, the surrounding
stable societies operate as a support structure, either slowing the
decline or preventing it from reaching a critical point. The stable
societies have an interest in preventing collapse, so they act to
mitigate it.

Something may be at play with radical female empowerment. A century ago,
when society was run by men, indulging female empowerment was a luxury
good, like having ice cream in the summer or a drink after dinner. Over
time, as the male power structure faltered and atrophied, female
empowerment expanded to fill the void. Because it was inherently
unstable and antithetical to orderly society, the overall society became
less stable, more chaotic. Our world got more hysterical.

In the example of Elizabeth Warren, we see this in miniature. For most
of her life, the necessity of career and social pressure kept her within
a narrow path. She could decorate her office with dream catchers,
pretending to be an Indian, but she had to follow the rules in order to
maintain her position. On the campaign trail, she suddenly found herself
free to express all of her thoughts. The result was demanding that
transgender children riding unicorns select cabinet members.

What we are seeing, I think, is a madness spreading across the ruling
class that is closely following the final feminization of it. If
Elizabeth Warren had not lost her marbles on the campaign trail, the
party would not be in the position to back a dementia patient for the
nomination. Just let that sink in for a moment. The inner party is
prepared to install a dementia patient in the White House as their best
option. That is prima facie evidence that the political class has
descended into madness.

The thing is, this virus spreading around the world could very well be
the crisis that requires a competent and assertive ruling class. Tough
decisions will need to be made in order to prevent a catastrophe. can we
realistically count on the people around Dementia Joe to make those
decisions? For that matter, can we count on Trump to provide sober
minded leadership and assurance in a crisis? Covid-19 could very well be
the modern equivalent of the Mongol Invasion.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sticther</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.
