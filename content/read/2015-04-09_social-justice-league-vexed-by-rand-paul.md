rel="noopener" target="_blank">It’s not hard to see how this will play
out in the general</a>. Any opposition to Cankles will be off limits
because, well, vagina.

*Rand Paul’s first day on the campaign trail was marred by a
high-profile fight with NBC’ “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie that
raised questions about whether he is ready for primetime.*

*Video of Paul telling Guthrie how she should do her job went viral on
social media, placing his attitude toward female reporters in the
spotlight.*

*The Kentucky GOP senator was ultimately forced to give a partial mea
culpa, even as he sought to dispel the notion that his earlier pushback
was sexist.*

*But the damage may have already been done for Paul.*

*“If this were the first time this had happened, that would be one
thing,” GOP strategist Ford O’Connell told The Hill. “But I’m not sure
it is all that clear to Rand Paul that, when you’re running for
president, it is not a good thing if you launch into a diatribe.”*

*The incident with Guthrie was reminiscent of a February interview with
CNBC’s Kelly Evans when the senator “shushed” the TV host and told her
to “calm down.”*

I’m not much of a Ran Paul fan, but if the dingbat twat squad is against
him, maybe he deserves a second look.
