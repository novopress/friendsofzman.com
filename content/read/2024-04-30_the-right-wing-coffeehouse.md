Last week Keith Woods posted on his Twitter a
<a href="https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1782350568704348232"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">video montage</a> of a guy going about
his daily routine somewhere in America. Woods captioned the video with
“One of the most disturbing videos I’ve ever watched.” What followed was
a chain of thousands of comments back and forth, either trying to
explain what Woods meant by that tweet or why he missed the point of the
video. The video is worth watching and the comments are worth reading to
get a sense of the debate.

The video itself was posted by the guy you see in it, and it turns out
that he is a reasonably successful man. He has an advanced degree and a
nice job. He is obviously doing well in the material sense. He is also
married to a professional woman, and they are expecting their first
child. Reportedly he posted the video without thinking much about how
people would react. As is often the case with “viral” content, this one
is about the people reacting to it, not the content.

The first thing it reveals is there is a segment of the on-line right
that looks at normal life as something to be avoided. For Woods and many
of his fans, a life like the man in the video enjoys is a nightmare. The
reason for it is they see his life as having been reduced to material
goods. He is not “living” in any meaningful way. He labors in a tedious
job inside a sterile office in order to pay for things that are as
sterile as the life he lives in order to obtain those things.

For this side of the on-line right, the point of life is not material
prosperity, but something else that they are never very good at
explaining. Keith Woods is not a hardy guy who is going to go off on
dangerous adventures. He is not signing up to be a soldier of fortune or
sail the seas as a merchant marine. In all probability his life is as
routine and boring as the man in the video. Yet, he thinks that life
should be about more than material comforts and should have a higher
purpose.

Romanticism like this is associated with the people we call the left,
but there has always been a strain of it on the right. This is
especially true in Europe, where the terms left and right used to mean
more than tomorrow and yesterday. In America, the people we call the
right have always embraced the sterility of material existence. The
point of life is to get a good job, work yourself to death to buy stuff
and then die before you become a financial burden on the next
generation.

Note that Woods was not universally denounced for his post. There was
another divide in the responses and that was the age divide. His younger
fans were right there with him in condemning the traditional definition
of success, while the old guys like Matt Walsh were
<a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1782510532169273551"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">baffled</a> by the response. From his
point of view, the old American right’s point of view, the video guy is
living the best life. It is impossible for Walsh to grasp why people
like Woods reacted negatively to the video.

No doubt hoping to benefit from the debate on Twitter, Nick Fuentes
posted this
<a href="https://rumble.com/v4rzpw0-nick-you-gotta-get-a-real-job.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> of himself mocking people with
jobs. Unlike the Keith Woods reaction, Fuentes is crude and
self-indulgent, but the point of view is the same. He is rejecting what
most people would consider a normal and happy life. It is important to
him that the world knows he rejects the conventional life. His critique
of women, heterosexuality and marriage all come from the same rejection
of the conventional.

This new romanticism is not entirely new with the Zoomers. Richard
Spencer should probably get credit for introducing this to the
alt-right. Much of his appeal was to the sorts of young men who
suspected that the middle-class suburban life they have always known was
missing something important. Spencer was never able to explain what was
missing, but he was able to tap into this longing in order to make
himself a cultural phenomenon for a brief time.

The superficiality of this new form of romanticism is what gives it the
coffee house radicalism vibe. By any reasonable standard, Richard
Spencer lived a boring life, even when he was at his peak fame. Other
than a few publicity stunts, he spent his days drinking and playing on
the internet. The next generation of online romantics does even less
living in the romantic sense. Woods and Fuentes, for example, are
teetotalers who primarily exist as avatars online.

Even so, there does seem to be a change among the young right-wing with
regards to their view of what constitutes a good life. Read the comments
to that Fuentes video and they are more slobbering than normal. The new
counterculture forming up is on the right and it is exclusively male.
Having been raised online, they want nothing to do with the mundane life
that makes the physical world possible. They may not know what they
want, but they do not want what is on offer.
