As this show is released to the world, I am preparing for The Mencken
Club conference, which is held annually here in Lagos. Unlike other
events on the far far far extreme right, this is an older and more
educated crowd. A good number of the attendees have advanced degrees,
work in the academy and are members of AARP. Last year, the crowd was a
blend of people in their 30’s and people in their 60’s, with a small
number in the Generation X category. In other words, it’s mostly Boomers
and Millennials.

Despite that, I had a good time last year, so I’m returning. I’d say the
crowd is also divided ideologically. The older crowd is pretty much
paleo-conservative, while the younger side skew alt-right. Given the
condition of the alt-right these days, I doubt any of them would use
that label, at least not in public. Still, the generational divide at
this event is a useful proxy for what is happening in the culture. The
older generation still thinks ideology is what matters, while the
younger generation is drifting into identity politics.

One of the things that will be interesting to watch over the next decade
is just how these sorts of events change, as the old give way to the
young. The older generation prefers a model similar to an academic
conference, in which you have speakers and organized social events. The
younger generation seems to be less inclined to formalized meetings and
more interested in the general socializing aspect. There’s also a
noticeable lack of leaders in the younger generation, willing to
organize these sorts of things.

Given the events of the last year, I’m interested in see who shows this
year. The older crowd is less concerned with being outed as a heretic
than the younger people, for obvious reasons. If you are a 30-something
college professor hoping to get tenure, you need to be cautious in this
age. This weekend will be a good test to see if the the endless
persecution of heretics is having its intended effect. If I don’t see as
many young faces this year, then we’ll know that the terror campaign
working. .

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
