Social media is all about getting as many stupid people as possible
together so they can bellow at anyone and everyone. Giving the dumb
fraction a veto over the rest of us will go down as a primary reason the
West collapsed. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s example eleventy billion</a>.

*The Jaguars have apologized for their mascot using the Ebola epidemic
to mock the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Terrible Towels during Sunday’s game
between the teams at EverBank Field on Sunday afternoon.*

*Jaxson de Ville held up a handwritten sign during the fourth quarter of
the game that read “TOWELS CARRY EBOLA” while carrying a yellow Terrible
Towel in his right hand. Jaguars president Mark Lamping said the team
had no prior knowledge of the sign and is handling the matter
internally.*

*“Improvisation and humor have both been key elements to the character
of Jaxson de Ville, especially when he performs at home games,” Lamping
said. “On Sunday, the person who has played Jaxson de Ville over the
past 20 seasons made an extremely poor decision in that regard.*

*“The team was unaware of this inappropriate sign, which was hand-made
by Jaxson during the fourth quarter of yesterday’s game, until after it
had been displayed. We are handling the matter internally and taking it
very seriously. We extend our sincerest apologies to anyone who was
offended.”*

Apologizing to people for their stupidity is madness. Spending a minute
of time on what was a silly joke at a game should be evidence at a
commitment hearing. The correct response here was “go bleep yourself”
when the scolds and pests complained about the mascot. But, that would
require perspective.

*Curtis Dvorak has been playing de Ville since the mascot’s inception in
1996. The picture of the mascot holding the sign went viral and drew the
ire of many on social media Sunday night.*

*Ebola is a viral disease that is highly infectious and spread by
contact with bodily fluids. It has a mortality rate of nearly 90
percent. According to the World Health Organization Ebola response
roadmap update from Friday, there have been nearly 8,000 probable,
confirmed or suspected cases of the disease in the African nations of
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.*

*There has been one confirmed case of Ebola in the United States, in
Dallas.*

Think about the intended audience of this column. These are people so
intensely stupid the writer is required to explain what Ebola is to
them. Frankly, if they are that stupid, what are the chances they can
read?
