Note: The

use the expression “of course” far too many times. Of course I do.
There’s also

Deep Space Nine and not liking it very much.

It is easy to forget, but one of the predictions about the
post-scarcity, technological age was that it would result in a great
leveling of society. Class it was argued, was the result of there never
being enough for everyone. Once there was plenty, there would be no need
for some to horde at the expense of others. Of course, the high-tech
society would abandon the silliness of class distinctions. Everyone
would wear gray Lycra jumpsuits and happily perform their roles in
society.

Like so much that comes from the Utopians, the class-less society
assumed things about people that could never be true. Hierarchy is an
essential part of the human condition, which means signaling status is a
feature, not a bug. The rich guy driving the expensive car is signally
his status in the same way a chieftain would signal his status with
ornamental weaponry. Even in a world where everyone can rely on having
plenty of the essentials, status and status signally still matter.

In fact, they probably count for more in a rich society than a poor one.
A guy who is worth fifty million can do a lot of signaling. He can have
a supercar, a big house in the country, expensive tastes. The
billionaire can have all of those things, of course, and that is a big
problem. How does the billionaire show he is a bigger fish than the guy
worth fifty million? He needs to have other stuff like political access,
cultural influence, and global attention. His status is measured in
attention.

Attention as currency is not confined to the plutocrats. This is one
distinguishing feature of the media age that arose with the American
empire. Before WW2, the super-rich would build mansions and fund public
projects like theaters, colleges, and museums, but this was always what
the top of society did to reinforce public virtue. In the medieval
period, the elite built churches, and cathedrals. In the Renaissance
they supported great artists and later they supported the sciences.

The world changed after the war as material progress suddenly
accelerated with the spread of American-style capitalism. Material
excess first took root in America and with it the growth of the
attention society. Popular culture, after all, is about getting public
attention in some way. In the early phase of pop culture, people got
famous through some talent for entertainment. Now people get attention
by being unusually freakish, deranged, or hysterical. The crazier the
better.

This is why so many people now experience the world with their mobile
device held up in front of their face. They are mining their daily
experience for the currency of the age, which is often a viral video or
a lot of likes on the social media platform. It is also why the
super-rich are fond of supporting increasingly deranged social fads. If
the freak show is the cathedral of the modern age, the super-rich must
show their status by building bigger and better freak shows for the
people.

One result of the giant freak show is that the culture is becoming less
rational as it becomes more bizarre. The governor of New York, for
example, gets a pass for murdering old people through ineptitude, but he
could end up in jail for upsetting a gentle lady in his employ. Of
course, that gentle lady could very well have an OnlyFans account and be
in favor of mutilating children, so crazy people can pretend that sex is
an imaginary part of the patriarchy.

In other words, the attention seeking society is one in which you can be
both a vulgar degenerate and an intolerant prude. The media is awash in
messages to young women saying they can only fulfill their purpose in
life by being a slut. On the other hand, if a man treats a woman like a
slut, he gets chased by an angry mom of sluts. You can be certain that
the women claiming Cuomo hurt their delicate feelings are mouthy
advocates for every vulgar item on the feminist to do list.

Morality is the software of every human society. It is the unwritten set
of rules, the habits of mind, that allow strangers to navigate their way
around one another. Morality must have a point and that point is
reflected in the organization of society. In a warrior society, the
qualities of the warrior are the goals of society. In an aristocratic
society, privilege, duty, and honor bound the moral code. The morality
of this age is wrapped around the desire for public attention, usually
public outrage.

Another aspect of the new morality is that it is arbitrary and random.
This is true of the carny world, where stardom is usually dumb luck. The
world is full of waitresses that look great and can act. Those that get
their big break are those who tick the right box at the right time for
some reason. This sense that life and death, success and failure are
controlled by the fickle gods of fate is the carny code. It is now
becoming the America creed, as we embrace the carny culture.

This is clear in the Cuomo story. The reason Andrew Cuomo is governor is
he is the son of a famous mobster. He won the lucky sperm contest. The
Covid panic was another big break for him. He got to carry on like a
hero, despite the fact he was recklessly putting the lives of old people
in jeopardy. The fates were kind to Cuomo, until another turn of the
wheel brought him low. Like the tragic figures popular in the carny
world, he will be ruined because he made a small mistake, not a big one.

It turns out that the post-scarcity world is like a giant carnival tent.
The only thing holding people together is a desire for attention. They
need the crowd in order to get the attention of the crowd. Semi-retarded
basketball players become billionaires because they are the best
performers in the human flea circus. Dingbat barmaids become congressmen
because they are good at getting attention. Post-scarcity America is
carny world, a freak show celebrating the worst humanity has to offer.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
