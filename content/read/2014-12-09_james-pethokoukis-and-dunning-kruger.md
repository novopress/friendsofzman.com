James Pethokoukis used to post at NRO about the economy and that’s where
he first got my attention. He tended to write things that stupid people
say when they wish to sound smart.
<a href="https://www.aei.org/author/james-pethokoukis/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">I looked him up</a> and sure enough, I found a
journalism major. I look at journalism majors in the same way I look at
communications majors. That is, these are people who were not smart
enough to real college work or they were simply too lazy to do real
college work.

In short order it became clear he was a fake nerd in the Ezra Klein
mold, but maybe not as good at working the bit. Klein puts a lot of
effort into it. Pethokoukis seems happy to be a clueless lunkhead that
thinks he is the smartest guy in the room. Thus, the reference to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&amp;oldid=612847043"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger.</a> As an aside, I love
how is called a “fellow” at AEI. These agitprop houses love bestowing
scholarly titles on one another.

Anyway, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">I saw this gem today</a> and thought it
was a great excuse to take some cheap shots at someone.

*One big difference between America’s K-12 education system and that of
other nations is where our teachers come from. <a
href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/Closing_the_talent_gap.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">McKinsey</a> has found that
top-performing nations recruit their teachers from the top third of
college students. As one report notes, school systems in
Singapore, Finland, and South Korea “recruit 100% of their teacher corps
from the top third” of the academic class vs. just 23% in the US.*

The other big difference, the one that makes all the difference, is the
schools in Finland, Taiwan and South Korea are full of Finns and East
Asians. When you compare US schools to those around the world, you have
to make that adjustment. Once you do that, you find out that our Finns
do as well as Finns everywhere. Our Koreans do better than those in
Korea. Thinking like that is hard and lunkhead can’t be bothered with
that.
