------------------------------------------------------------------------

The terms Left and Right have been ubiquitous in Western public
discourse for so long people just assume they are universal constants.
The fact is though, they are neither universal nor constant. There is no
African Right or Burmese Left. These cultures have not been shaped by
the French Revolution. Similarly, what it means to be on the Right or
Left has changed over time. Today’s left-wing American genuinely detests
yesterday’s left wing American, who is probably on the Right today.

There is not much in the way of ideology on either side. There has not
been an important thinker on either side in a long time. The last
important radical thinker was probably Herbert Marcuse or perhaps John
Rawls. On the Right, Paul Gottfried and Sam Francis are recent, but
their influence is only on the fringe. The main driver of politics is
the Left and they are wildly ignorant of the intellectual history that
shapes left-wing politics today.

In the main, people divide up over history. What controls the American
Left is the sense that the past is littered with monsters. These
monsters are things like slavery, discrimination, morality, decency and
so forth. The fact that these things have existed means they could exist
again. The practical effect of something like slavery, for example, is
zero, but the possibility it could return shapes the present. These
monsters haunt the dense fog that is the left-wing mental space.

This is why the Left maintains all of its focus on the future, a place
that is free of those monsters like inequality and human suffering. It
is a secular Gnosticism in which a mystical and esoteric understanding
of what lies at the end of history justifies the assault on the present.
The monsters of the past haunt this fallen world and the only way out is
to destroy this world thus freeing mankind from its grip and allowing
man to move into the next phase of human history.

On the other side of this is the Right. They share the Left’s disdain
for the present, but for entirely different reasons. They see the
present as a degraded version of some past they hold up as the ideal. To
be on the Right is to consume yourself with discovering forgotten
kingdoms and then imagining yourself in them. Just as the future is an
escape for the man of the Left, the past is a refuge for the man of the
Right. The difference is his escape is much more detailed and appointed.

It is on the Right where you see the immutable differences between
American and European politics. In Europe, the man of the Right can
embrace ancient social structures like pre-Christian paganism and
tribalism. He can embrace the aristocratic age of the high Middle Ages.
These are not pasts that an American can conjure as they do not exist in
the American past. The one shared alternative is the period of the
interwar years but that brings unique problems.

For Americans, the most popular past is the Founding. Throughout the
20th century, right-wing Americans have said some version of, “If we
just return to our founding principles everything will be fine.” Even at
this late date there is an effort to conjure the 18th century colonial
experience into the present. Implementations of this have been a desire
to return to the America of the 1950’s or the 1980’s. In both cases, it
is a desire to go back before the start of the present troubles.

This difference between Left and Right explains the difference in
tangible results over the last century. Left-wing activity can move
forward. Time marches on regardless of human desire, so the illusion of
progress is easy to maintain. It just requires the destruction of
present customs and traditions. The image of a toppled statue provides
the left-wing mind with s symbolic step toward the promised land, which
in turn provides a motivation to keep moving forward.

The Right has the insurmountable problem of time. There is no way to go
back in time to start over. Time only moves forward. This physical
reality that provides the Left with hope provides the Right with dread.
Every day they move further from their desired spot in the past,
suggesting it will never be attained. This despair results in a stubborn
defense of the present, not because of its superiority to the proposed
future, but for its vantage point into the desired past.

The reason modern conservatism is stuck in 1985 is because that was the
last good viewing point for 1955. Of course, that was the last good
viewing point for 1925 and so on into the founding period. Similarly,
for many on the European Right, the interwar years were the last high
ground to see the fading aristocratic order. For the Right, history is a
series of signal fires leading back to a romanticized ideal order where
Western man could fully express his nature.

While the Left has the advantage of time, they are increasingly haunted
by the fact they are running out of it. The old Marxist framing said
that once economic relations were solved, political relations would be
solved. That proved to be both impossible and incorrect, so they moved
up to the institutions. Once they controlled those, they would guide
society into the future. That led to the seizing of the culture. By
controlling the means of cultural production, they can build the desired
future.

Of course, the reality of the human condition is once again unravelling
these plans for the great temporal leap. The only thing that remains is
something like a rapture in which the political elect is taken off this
fallen world into the promised land, leaving the rest of humanity
behind. One reason the Left sounds increasingly like a UFO cult is they
are sure the end times are approaching. They cannot articulate it, by
they sense the hour is short and the great finale will happen any
minute.

The Right is not prepared to make the leap into the abys but they are
also haunted by the prospect of time. In their case, it is the reality
that is too late to defend the present from the ravages of the Left.
There is nothing left to defend. The last bridges to the past have been
severed. Like survivors on a lifeboat, the Right is terrified by the
prospect of floating along for eternity in a sea of nothingness. For the
Right, hell is the eternal present, cut off from the past.

Perhaps this signals the final denouement of the cycle that began with
the French Revolution and ushered in ideological politics. The dream of
the glorious future will die with the dreams of a return to the glorious
past. Politics will lose its sacredness and return to being the struggle
over practical things. The sacred and the profane will return to the
sphere outside of earthly demands. The sacred will produce moral men to
debate the practical, rather than practical men to debate morality.

On the other hand, maybe the West is simply out of time. The long cycle
that began in the high Middle Ages has run its course. The people will
remain but what defines them, that old Western tradition, including its
messianic claims, will fade away, slowly replaced by something not yet
born. The West is now a death row inmate waiting execution, terrified of
both the future and the past. The former for obvious reasons and the
past because it is what brought him to this point.
