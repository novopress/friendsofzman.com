Over the holidays, the great Jared Taylor was on one of the many live
streams that pop up during the that time. He was asked if as a
Southerner, he found some pleasure in seeing the statue toppling mobs
now turning on statues of Lincoln. The irony of nonwhites going after
Lincoln as a white supremacist is hard to miss. Taylor demurred, saying
something along the lines that he abhorred any attacks on whites or
white history, even if the person in question made war on his ancestors.

It was an interesting answer as it touches on the central problem of the
current crisis we see playing out in America. Who’s to blame for it? The
basic starting point of problem solving is to identify the problem and
then identify the cause. When the mortgage market fell apart a decade
ago, people blamed the bankers. Some people blamed the credit agencies
or the regulators. There was plenty of blame to go around, so lots of
people were blamed, but no one was punished.

In the case of the ongoing pogroms against white people, there is not
much talk about who is responsible for it. Part of that is due to the
prohibitions against white people talking about being white. One of the
great ironies of this crisis is that the media is filled with invective
about white people, but you will never see a white person start a
sentence with “as a white person.” Whiteness is a thing that is only
allowed to be a hobgoblin in the minds and mouths of the anti-whites.

Getting back to the Taylor example, he cannot laugh at the mob turning
on Lincoln, because Lincoln was white, but that would apply to the mob
as well. If the people doing the toppling are white, then the Taylor
rule prevents a pro-white partisan from blaming them for it. An
inescapable fact of the current crisis is the people leading the
anti-white pogrom are often white or white presenting. Giving white
people a pass on partisan grounds creates a problem when trying to
assign blame.

This is why the anti-white pogroms have met so little resistance thus
far. On the one hand you have the taboo against white people taking
their own side. On the other hand, you have the face of the anti-white
program being white or white presenting. If all of the anti-whites were
black, then the problem of assigning blame would be simpler, but the
leading anti-whites are almost always a pale face. The chief racketeer
in the grievance rackets is a white woman named Robin DiAngelo.

The attacks on white people are just one example. The financialization
of the economy starting in the 1980’s has created a massive wealth
disparity. America now has an invisible over-class that owns almost all
of the wealth. What they do not own directly, they control through what
amounts to regulatory capture. They control the institutions that set
the rules on how you can use your property. Inevitably, those rules
favor the greed heads that control the financial system.

How did this happen? Who is responsible for it? Conservative will say
that you cannot blame capitalism or free markets. Just like the taboo
against whites taking their own side, they enforce a taboo against
questioning the current economic order. Similarly, you cannot blame rich
people, as that’s class warfare. If you do not like the rich people
running things, get rich and challenge them. It is a version of build a
better mousetrap so the world will beat a path to your door.

The Left side of the political class has an answer. They say the reason
for the massive wealth disparity is white privilege and systemic racism.
They focus on the white and white presenting faces running the
corporations. This is a dangerous game for obvious reasons, so it is
deliberately made absurd. The result, however, is white people are left
with two choices when wondering who is to blame for this. They can
either blame themselves or celebrate their dispossession.

This shape shifting that prevents the people from identifying the cause
of the problems that plague their society is the result of democracy.
When everyone has a vote, either in an election or in the economy, then
everyone is to blame for the result. Don’t like woke capital? Don’t buy
from it. Don’t like woke government? Don’t vote for it. The fact that no
one actually voted for it or demanded it makes no difference. The blame
for every problem is the imaginary neighbor who is demanding it.

This is one reason for the increasing unhappiness. It is not just the
problems people can see all around them. It is the fact that there is no
acceptable cause. People are left to blame themselves and their
neighbors. If everyone is to blame, then everyone is the problem and
everyone is in a war with everyone. The democratization of a society
means the democratizing of blame. Self-hatred and self-loathing become
the creed of the majority, with only the minorities are able to find a
suitable enemy.

This is an unnatural condition as people are naturally inclined to find
the source of their unhappiness and make that the focus of their anger.
Eric Hoffer noted that “mass movements can rise and spread without
belief in a God, but never without belief in a devil.” Get enough angry
people together with the raw material for a shared identity and they
will find their devil. This is what makes being in the ruling class a
dangerous game right now. It is why they are stacking the sandbags so
high.

This is usually where the conservative pops back in and says it is wrong
to pin the blame on people when the problem is systemic. The thing is
though, the people at the top of any society have a duty to the system
that creates them. They are the stewards of the system. The ruling elite
of our liberal democracy are responsible for economic and cultural
troubles underlying the current crisis. It is their failure to do their
duty as a ruling elite that has led us to this point. They are to blame.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
