**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about college football and
the war on tradition, a post about the bunker mentality in Washington.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the long holiday weekend, President Joe Biden pardoned his crooked
son Hunter, which surprised only the enemies of Donald Trump. Everyone
else knew that the old man would not leave office without cleaning up
the mess of his son. Say what you will about Joe Biden, but he loves his
kids, perhaps too much. At some level, you must respect his family
loyalty. There is an old world gangsterism about his willingness to help
his family loot the political system.

An interesting part of the pardon is that it is not just a pardon for
specific crimes that have been alleged by the Department of Justice. It
is a blanket pardon for all things he may have done since 2014. This
does not cover state crimes like murder, but outside of something
extreme like that, it means he has been given the sort of get out of
jail free card reserved for important gangsters. Henry Hill, of
*Goodfellas* fame, was given this type of deal so he would become a rat.

If the 2014 start date seems important, that is because it is when the
Biden family started feeding at the Ukraine trough. This was when the
State Department engineered the Maidan coup that toppled the Ukrainian
government of President Yanukovych, who refused to sign a deal with the
EU. Once he was gone, the State Department helped put Petro Poroshenko
in charge, who was followed by Volodymyr Zelensky. It is funny how so
much has revolved around Ukraine for a decade.

That is what keeps many people in Washington up at night. Trump
returning with a vengeance could mean him directing his people to
investigate this long running scam called Project Ukraine. After all, it
was his decision to question Ukraine that got him impeached, so Ukraine
should be at the top of his vengeance list. That and the Ukrainians are
desperate to cut a deal with Trump. There may be more Ukraine related
pardons coming before January 20th.

That is what makes the timing of this interesting. Normally, the
president leaving office signs the pardons on the way out the door or
maybe over the Christmas holiday, in order to minimize attention. Bill
Clinton pardoned the Jewish gangster Marc Rich on his last day in
office. At the time, Rich was on the lamb hiding in Switzerland, but his
wife was loading the Clinton family down with cash and prizes. Rich got
rich as part of the looting of post-Soviet Russia, in case you are
wondering.

As an aside, once word got out that Clinton had pardoned Marc Rich there
was a hue and cry in Washington demanding that the incoming Republican
administration investigate the matter. It was not just Republicans
pretending to be outraged. All the beautiful people were playing along
as well. Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to look into it,
but she took the job seriously, so she was replaced with James Comey,
who could find nothing wrong with it.

That aside, it would have made much more sense for Biden to have done
this on the way out the door, so it suggests this is part of a process.
Everyone involved in the very dirty dealings in Ukraine must remain
silent or face the prospect of Hunter Biden talking without fear of
prosecution. Given how the Biden family has operated over the years, it
probably means the next six weeks will be a pardon auction for those who
ever did business with the Biden family.

The hilarious part of this is how the people we call the left are having
a collective meltdown over this news. Twitter/X is now full of angry
denunciations from Trump haters about how this makes them look stupid.
The people who serious thought Kamala Harris was a good choice are also
very vexed. They see this as proof that their girl boss was undermined
by a conspiracy of pale penis people. They are now determined to make
sure this never happens again. That should be fun.

Official Washington sees the problem with this pardon. They have been
running with the narrative that Trump is a say anything to win dictator
who will then grow a small mustache as soon as he returns to Washington.
That sort of self-righteous indignation does not work when your side is
issuing blanket pardons to family members and potentially anyone with a
fat wallet. It is hard to claim Trump is corrupt when Joe Biden is
putting pardons up on eBay.

In a way, it is a fitting end point for this long moral panic that
kicked off during the Obama administration and came crashing down in
this election. The subtext to all of it was that the good guys, the
people launching the pogroms and panics, were surrounded by an invisible
army loyal to Old Scratch. This required any means necessary to reveal
and then defeat this threat to our democracy. It turns out that the
threat was in the mirror all along.

Not only has the “crying Trump” run its course, but the moral panic that
has been the basis of it has also run its course. The public no longer
believes any of it now and the people doing the point and shriek are
running out of energy. It also means there is no more money to be had
from monetizing these panics. The relatively muted response to the
election is the result of exhaustion. The Hunter Biden pardon is the
start of a great sweep up from a party that went on far too long.
