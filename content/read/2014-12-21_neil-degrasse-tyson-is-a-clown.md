I must admit I have zero interest in <span class="st">Neil deGrasse
Tyson</span>. He’s a magical ornament for the Left and the fake nerds.
He bills himself as a scientist, but he makes his living as an amusement
park manager. That and doing the trained monkey bit on TV. There’s
nothing wrong with it. Lots of people enjoy planetariums. Everyone loves
TV and you can’t have TV without trained monkeys. But, he guy is a
complete clown.

I get that his audience wants validation so they come to hear the
magical black guy tell them they are the bestest. My guess is there’s
not a single person in the audience that could count their balls twice
and come up with the same number so that means he can’t actually talk
about real science. It’s all theater, a morality play, of sorts. He
mocks the bad people in the familiar way and they arf like seals at the
right time. It’s the Jon Stewart routine, but with high school science
as the straight man instead of politics.

The thing that surprises me about this video is just how buffoonish he
is during his act. The time or two I’ve caught him on TV he was
pretending to be a serious scientist, but in that video he one step from
dropping his pants and spraying his junk with seltzer. It’s rather
embarrassing to watch, particularly since the premise is so absurd. If I
did not know better, I’d think he was cleverly mocking the rubes in the
audience.
