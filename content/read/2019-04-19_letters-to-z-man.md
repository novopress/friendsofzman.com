Back around Thanksgiving last year I did a whole show just answering
questions from the e-mail and people liked it. I read all my e-mail, but
not in a timely fashion. I try to sit down once per week and go through
the inbox, but life does not always cooperate. My work life is conducted
by e-mail. That means I spend a lot of my time reading and replying to
e-mail during the day, so I lose track of my personal stuff. Doing a
show once in a while just on e-mail and other correspondence is a good
way for me to catch up on it.

What I did is group these by topic and then make a general e-mail out of
them in order to cloak any revealing details of the correspondents. That
seems like a fair thing to do as I don’t want to get anyone in trouble.
I get a lot of e-mail and comments, so a lot of stuff did not make it. I
should probably do a post once per month just on correspondence as a
regular feature. I think I tried that once before, but I may be
mistaken. I’ve written so many posts that I’m starting to forget some of
the things I’ve done over the years.

This is Good Friday, so Happy Easter to my Christian readers and
listeners. It is also the start of Passover, so Happy Passover to my
Jewish readers and listeners. Perhaps it is just me, but it seems like
Easter is not what it used to be these days. When I was a kid, the
grocery store would be full of Easter themed items. I noticed my market
just had one little area with Easter and Passover items. Perhaps people
just don’t do the baskets and candy stuff anymore. Maybe it is just
something about Lagos I’m just noticing.

One other housekeeping item. I will be on the RamZPaul show tomorrow. He
invited me and Frodi Midjord on to talk about some of the things we
discussed in Finland at the Awakening conference. I don’t think there is
a fixed agenda, but the general these is about how we go about
organizing and networking in the age of mass suppression. Frodi has his
ideas on these things as a European organizer and I have my thoughts as
an American, who is always dodging the censors. It should be a good
conversation.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
