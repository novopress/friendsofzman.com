When I did the podcast on libertarianism, I re-read [Democracy: The God
That
Failed](https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-God-That-Failed-Perspectives/dp/0765808684),
as a refresher on the more responsible brand of libertarian thought. I
wanted to be fair, and I wanted to address their best arguments. It had
been a while since I read the book, and I was reminded of some things I
really liked about Hoppe’s treatment of democracy. I reject his
materialism, of course, but some of his language is useful in discussing
democracy in the modern age. As is always the case, there are useful
things in every book.

Democracy has become an almost esoteric concept since Hoppe wrote his
book. That is one of the things he missed in his treatment. It is
something the paleocons picked up on in their analysis of the managerial
state. Government needs legitimacy and that can only come through a
foundation in or an attachment to the transcendent. Democracy in the
modern age has matured into a religion of the state, but a religion with
a mystical sense of the supernatural, one that goes unspoken, but is
always hovering on the periphery.

Anyway, I have not written much about the topic, so it seemed like a
good subject for a podcast. It also dovetails in with some other stuff I
plan to write about in the coming months. It is also a good way to
introduce the walking dead on the other side of the great divide, who
need help coming over the river to our side, to some of our critiques of
the modern age. As with the show on libertarianism, this one could have
easily been three hours, so I had to take many shortcuts and a fair
amount of artistic license.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I am now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
