The great mistake over the last century, or more, is in thinking that
the American Left is an intellectual movement that relies on facts and
reason to formulate policy and strategy, with the goal of making the
nation better. Conservatives have long been obsessed with talking about
the Left as their colleagues, insisting they are simply mistaken, but
otherwise well intentioned. The truth is, the Left in America is a cult,
a suicide cult, that seeks to pull down the support beams of society so
the roof collapses on all of us.

The absurdity of the Russian hacking claims should be enough to put this
story to bed long ago, but the media is run by the Cult so they are
pumping air into this story every day. The Washington Post ran a fake
news story with claims that the CIA has proof the Russians forced John
Podesta to write all of those embarrassing e-mails that got released by
WikiLeaks. Put another way, the people running the Post are willing to
destroy what is left of their reputation to promote something they know
is nonsense.

It is one thing for a campaign to cook up fake news in order to divert
attention. The Clinton people were desperate to get their scandals out
of the news so they made up the Russian hacking stuff. Politicians of
all stripes do this sort of thing. LBJ used to accuse his opponents of
horrible things, just so they would have to deny it. What the Left is
engaging in now is an attempt to undermine public support of the
political system. It’s as if they figure that if they can’t win, then
everyone must lose.

What makes it especially suicidal is the obvious consequences, if their
efforts actually succeeded. Let’s assume they are able to crack
the Electoral College and overthrow the election. The result would be a
constitutional crises. <a

target="_blank">As Steve Sailer pointed out the other day</a>, the
people pushing for that should think about who would probably step into
the crisis to impose order. The military is full of PC ninnies, but
there are plenty of people in uniform that would like a shot at changing
it. It is a safe bet that they did not vote for Clinton.

Of course, none of this is going to happen. Still, the public does
notice that the people in charge are unwilling to abide by their own
rules. To some degree, that is why Trump won the election. Corruption is
just lawlessness among the ruling class and Trump promised to clean it
up. If the ruling class appears to be throwing the rules aside in order
to stop Trump, the public is going to begin to wonder why they are
supporting the political system at all. <a

None of this is to say the nation is staggering toward revolution or
civil war. That seems unlikely at the present date, but the lesson of
history is that things can spiral out of control quickly. The number one
duty of every ruling elite is to maintain public support of the system
that props up the ruling elite. Progressive attempts to kick the legs
out from under the system could eventually work. The fact that they will
be the first ones sent to the gallows does not seem to bother them. In
fact, they probably long for it.
