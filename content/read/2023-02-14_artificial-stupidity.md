Over the last few months, the internet has been buzzing about artificial
intelligence, largely due to the release of
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>. Lots of people have been having fun with it
and lots of bad people have been making it do bad things. Even more
people, those who fashion themselves as big-brained thought leaders,
have been telling us what this means for the future of humanity. Of
course, everyone selling a product is quickly adding the letters “AI” to
their marketing kit.

The ChatGPT is an interesting project, but as the bad people referenced
above have shown, it is still a work in progress. Even so, it does
reveal two things that are important in the much larger discussion of
artificial intelligence. One is that there has been some progress is
creating what *feels* like intelligence. A bit of software that feels
like it could be a human making small talk is a big step. That big step,
however, is relative to where things were to this point.

This is a barely perceptible move forward, relative to where things need
to be in order to start discussing anything close to artificial
intelligence. In fact, you would need a much more powerful algorithm to
detect the progress than what we currently possess, in order to quantify
the progress. The main reason for that is we are not entirely sure if we
can define human intelligence at the moment. In fact, we cannot even
agree on where to start with such a project.

Now, HBD types and psychometrists might bristle at that, but crude
methods to quantify aspects of intelligence are not the same as
understanding the nature of it. We can sit two children down, give them
a battery of intelligence tests and make some mostly accurate
predictions about their life outcomes. We have enough data now to make
statistically significant observations about relative intelligence. That
is not the same as understanding the nature of human intelligence.

The reason for this is we do not understand human consciousness, of
which intelligence is just one aspect. In fact, the human sciences are
struggling to come up with a definition of consciousness. The physical
sciences operate under the assumption that collections of non-conscious
agents can come together somehow and create consciousness, but that is
probably wrong. There is a good chance that it puts the cart before the
horse.

That is, conscious agents are what cause non-conscious agents. What we
think of as space-time and the objects within it are the result of human
consciousness. This is the basis of Donald Hoffman’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Reality-Evolution-Truth/dp/0393254690"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> *The Case Against Reality,* in
which he explains why much of what we assume to be true about the
universe is probably wrong. For those who prefer an audio version of his
work, <a
href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=reYdQYZ9Rj4&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> is a good interview of Hoffman
by the ubiquitous YouTuber Lex Fridman.

Hoffman’s approach rests on two things that seem to be true. One is that
nature does not reward accuracy in our perceptions, but rather the
fitness of our perceptions, which Hoffman
<a href="http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FitnessBeatsTruth_apa_PBR.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stated</a> as *Fitness Beats Truth*. The
short version is that evolution only cares about that which impacts
fitness. As a result, a strategy that seeks only to improve fitness
will, over time, dominate a strategy that seeks to create a more
accurate perception of the world.

There is a lot of math involved in Hoffman’s presentation, but there is
a much simpler way to think of it. We see in the marketplace for goods
and services that the most popular product is never the ideal product.
The Windows desktop won the computer wars not because it was the
platonic ideal of the personal computer, but because it was good enough
and cheap enough to win the fitness game relative to the other options,
some of which were technically better.

The game of life works the same way. That which makes it easier for a
living thing to replicate itself gets rewarded. That which inhibits
replication gets punished. That is it and nothing more. If human
perception evolved to improve our fitness, then it means it did not
evolve to give us a more accurate perceptions of reality. That does not
mean we live in a dream world. It just means that we cannot assume that
our perception of non-contextual reality is accurate or even real.

The other thing Hoffman points out in his book is that theoretical
physics has run into a very big problem. That problem is local realism.
This is the principle of locality which states a thing is changed only
if it is touched. The second half states that properties of objects are
real and exist in our physical universe independent of our minds. This
is the foundation of physics and it may not be true. Experiments have
challenged locality and realism, suggesting one or both are false.

This brings us back to the artificial intelligence problem. The
likelihood of us creating intelligence, much less conscious
intelligence, even by accident is so low as to not be considered a
serious topic of discussion. As Hoffman explains in his book, we are not
close to understanding the nature of consciousness. We are not even sure
the world we assume to be objective reality is more than an interface.
It could literally be a figment of our collective imagination.

Like discussion of space aliens floating balloons over North America,
talk of artificial intelligence is a nice distraction. We seem have a
need to believe that such things are possible and perhaps discoverable
in our time. In reality, they lie well outside our ability to grasp,
other than the fictional. Intelligence is an aspect of consciousness and
most likely that is not the result of non-conscious agents. That means
intelligence is not simply clever math operating on non-conscious
agents.

If a non-human intelligence were to visit our local concept of
space-time from its place on the N-dimensional manifold that is reality,
it would point out that our fancy new AI is not much more than a
relatively faster calculator. From its perspective, it would be
comically simplistic compared to our own consciousness. AI and the
pursuit of it is a fun distraction, but it is not the dawn of
super-intelligent robots enslaving humanity. We can do that without the
aid of a clever chatbot.
