There is a theme to the show this week. As I was collecting up items to
use, I noticed that many of them featured people in a state of
self-delusion. That was not intentional, but it just worked out that
way. I was hoping to find some items that I could make sport of as this
is a holiday weekend. I think it is a good idea to try and keep in light
when people are in the holiday mood. This is the first holiday of the
summer and probably the one people look forward to the most. I’ll be off
until Tuesday, weather permitting.

I tried to find some opening music that fit the theme, but I could not
find anything I liked and that worked as intro music. Surprisingly,
there’s not a lot of music about self-delusion. I guess that probably
hits too close to home for people in the entertainment rackets. That and
songs about drug taking sort of fill that niche. The result is I went
with whatever struck my fancy last night. AC/DC seems like a nice
lead-in to a long holiday weekend.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
