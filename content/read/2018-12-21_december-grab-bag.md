Most likely, this is the final show of 2018. I am not sure if I will do
one next week, because of this being the start of a long holiday. Lots
of people drop out between Christmas and New Year’s Day to travel and
decompress. I am one of them. I was going to spend the week in Paris,
but the whites are rioting again, so that is out. Instead, I will be
using the time to take care of administrative items around the office,
catch up on my reading and reset various projects I have going. It is a
good time to reset and get ready for a fresh start.

I will be dropping in on [Happy
Homelands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzzUa7-VAw) on Saturday.
Paul and Tiina will be hosting a special Christmas show, which will have
a bunch of people on over two hours. I always recommend Paul’s videos to
people curious about what is happening on our side of the great divide.
They are nice, gentle introductions to our topics and people. I thought
[his appearance with Millennial
Woes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wxD7PqndpU) last week was great.
Our side needs more accessible personalities, because most people see us
as the Hell’s Angels of politics.

Otherwise, the next week will be a light posting week. For me, light
posting means a day or two off, but everything is relative. It also
depends upon how events play out with the big showdown over the wall
funding. I’m not all that confident Trump can get a deal done, but maybe
[Ann Coulter taunting
him](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/422220-trump-stops-following-ann-coulter-on-twitter-after-joke-presidency-comments)
has finally snapped him out of his funk. This is probably where we find
out if Trump has any chance of winning a second term. But, we will have
to see what happens. Maybe we get lucky and it wraps up today.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
