Instead of doing a bunch of stuff on the impeachment hoax, I decided to
go another way and have some fun with the social justice warriors. My
guess is most people are already sick of the media’s attempt to foist
this latest left-wing lunacy upon us. The massive, coordinated effort to
gas light the public on this is breathtaking. No doubt the Left is
loving this, but normal people have to be thinking very dark thoughts. A
quick look at Drudge and it is clear the media detached from reality.

Speaking of Drudge, what in the world happened to that site? I deleted
the book mark back in the 2016 campaign, as I got sick of the anti-Trump
stuff he ran every day, but my goodness, that site is garbage now. His
site has always been run by rent boys he picks up in South Beach, but he
used to exercise some judgement over them. Maybe his lifestyle has
finally caught up with him. Whatever the reason, his site is unreadable
at this point. It’s a hysterical version of the New York Times.

Anyway, for a little relief from the madness, the show this week is
about the various social justice causes. The segment on Emily Walton is
my favorite, as it reminds me of when I used to haunt the comment
section of news sites. It was always good fun to post biographical
material about the author of a post about social justice. Inevitably,
the white people demanding justice are always the sort who organize
their lives so they never have to experience vibrancy. They talk like
MLK and live like the KKK.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
