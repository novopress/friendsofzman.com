An important project of the Left for a long time now has been to
discredit the idea that intelligence is genetic and therefore heritable.
In order to maintain the blank slate, they have to argue against
genetics and evolution. Anytime someone can produce a study showing that
environment alters life outcomes, progressives rush to the internet to
trumpet the study as if it was holy writ. That has been
<a href="http://time.com/5311672/iq-scores-decline-environment/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the response</a> to
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/05/1718793115"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Norwegian study</a> on intelligence,
that claims to observe a reverse in the Flynn Effect.

There is confusion in the commentary, because there is confusion about
the meaning of the Flynn Effect. The Left likes to claim that the Flynn
Effect shows that better schools and ideological indoctrination make
people smarter. What the Flynn Effect observes is that populations get
smarter as environmental conditions improve. People also get taller when
environmental conditions improve. In other words, an improving physical
environment means more people able to reach their genetic potential.

On the other hand, the other side often leaps to the conclusion that
immigration and fertility rates exclusively drive IQ. This is true in
the aggregate. Import large numbers of Africans into Iceland and the
average intelligence of Iceland will decline. That does not mean the
native Icelander got dumber, although the decision to import Africans
could be proof of that claim. The Flynn Effect observes that children
will be smarter than their parents, when environmental conditions
improve. A better life means better kids.

This Norwegian study is causing <a
href="https://reason.com/blog/2018/06/15/people-are-getting-dumber-the-flynn-effe"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">blank slate believers</a> to
hyperventilate because it claims to show a decline in IQ within
families. Specifically, the children are dumber than their parents and
younger brothers are dumber than older brothers. Children born in the
1960’s had an average IQ a little over 99, while children born in the
1970’s had an average IQ of 102. Since then, IQ’s have declined to the
1960’s level. Because this was measured within families, it rules out
genetics, dysgenics and immigration as causes.

Now, the first thing to note is that blank slate people employ the same
tactic we used to see with the intelligent design people. The ID’ers
would hunt around for anything they could hold up discrediting Darwin or
natural selection, no matter how trivial or tangential, so they could
claim evolution was not science. This was supposed to “prove” that
intelligent design was therefore a valid theory. Blank slate people play
the same game by trying to poke holes in genetics.

There’s a word for this sort of argument. It is called sophistry. Just
because natural selection cannot solve every puzzle in the fossil
record, that does not mean magic is the default explanation for the
fossil record. Similarly, just because IQ’s appear to be declining
within Norwegian families does not mean IQ is not heritable. It has
always been known that intelligence varies within families. The question
posed by this study is what is causing the change.

Further, it has been observed for a long time that average intelligence
within Western societies have been declining since the 1970’s. Overall
IQ appears to have peaked in the 1970’s and been in decline ever since.
Immigration is one cause. Another is the habit of smart successful
people having fewer children.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZ0ZUy7P3E" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">The opening scene to Idiocracy</a> is not entirely
wrong, even though fertility among the poor has declined. Smart people
used to have big families, because they could.

Again, this Norwegian study is not reporting this sort of result.
Instead, they are picking up a decline within families. The one
potential flaw is that it measures only male intelligence, which means
sons are dumber than fathers and younger brothers are dumber than older
brothers. The Flynn Effect observes increases in IQ within families due
to improved environmental conditions. Therefore, a decline would
logically be linked to some unknown environmental changes.

Of course, the changes are quite small, so it could simply be the
<a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27199" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Breeder’s Equation</a> at work. The uptick in the sample
population used in this study could have been driven by a bit of
environmental luck. The decline is simply a reversion to the mean. The
recent uptick you see in the above graph could also indicate a natural
variance between a maximum and minimum for this group. The observable
difference between a 99 and 102 IQ is so small it has no impact.

All that said, there are two things we know are true about human
intelligence. One is the population with low-IQ’s are breeding like
bunnies. Simple math says mankind is getting dumber on average. The
other thing we know is that the load
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the smart fraction</a> can carry is finite. Pile in
enough stupid people in a population and eventually they overwhelm the
efforts of the smart people. The puzzle is in figuring out the tipping
point and the goal is to make sure to avoid it.
