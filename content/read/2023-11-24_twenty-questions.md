In years past, whenever I have put out the call for questions, there
would be questions about specific people in politics and questions about
a particular question. This time there were no such questions. The
former questions have gone away along with the drama, which was a
defining feature of outsider politics. The days of various e-celebs
warring with one another seem to have passed.

The other question has also changed. You see it with the reaction to the
Israel – Gaza cheerleading from conservatives. Ten years ago, the only
negative responses to Shapiro or Pollack would have been the old school
JQ stuff. These days it is much more nuanced and matter of fact. A large
swath of people seem to have internalized many of these arguments into a
casual acceptance of ethnic reality.

I did not get a single Ukraine question. A good question is how the
general public will respond when the inevitable happens in Ukraine in
2024. The war is not on anyone’s list of concerns at the moment, not
even for those on this side of the divide. Will that change when things
fall apart next year? Team Biden never recovered from the Afghanistan
debacle, even though it had been off the radar for years.

It is a small sample size, but it got me thinking that much of the
action on this side of the divide has moved away from practical politics
to thinking about the systemic and philosophic issues at the heart of
the current crisis. The number of people who have quietly thrown in the
towel on conventional politics continues to rise. If there is no
solution at the ballot box, what is the point of talking about it?

Trump is gearing up for his 2024 campaign and you can sense that it is
going to be very different from 2016 because the people are different.
Relative to many people in the crowd, Trump will sound like a calming
voice, rather than the sarcastic bomb thrower scandalizing the squares
in Washington. Trump is now a moderate voice, a compromise for the
ruling class to buy some time.
