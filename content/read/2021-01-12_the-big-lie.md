The expression “the big lie” gets tossed around a lot in modern times,
usually defined as the means with which the Nazis fooled the people. In
reality, the expression was coined by the most significant man in
history to explain how the people who tried to prevent the catastrophe
of the Great War ended up being blamed for it. The big lie is a
falsehood so big that no one would think it possible to state such a
lie. In other words, it is believed because it is so outlandish it must
be true.

One of the many ironies of this age is that the people the most
significant man in history accused of employing the “the big lie” have
spent generations since that time redefining it to mean Nazi propaganda.
In popular culture, the Left will apply the expression to some
inconvenient facts pointed out by their many enemies. They claim a
famous propaganda minister associated with the most significant man in
history is the guy who coined the expression to describe his own
efforts.

That is the real trick of “the big lie” that gets missed. The
audaciousness of it distracts the attention of people. Instead of
focusing on the facts of something happening in society, their eye moves
to some other related thing. It’s no different than how a magician uses
distraction to get the audience looking one way while he some other
sleight of hand. Even though you know he does not possess magical
powers, you are amazed nonetheless.

We see this in how the term “fascist” is used in this age. The Left in
the West has always accused their enemies of being fascists, even when
there were no actual fascists vying for political power. For a period,
fascists and communist were locked in a bitter struggle for the soul of
socialism, so it makes sense. In America is never made much sense, as we
never had fascists or a communist party of note, but for the Left
everywhere, it is always monkey see, monkey do.

Even so, through the Cold War, a popular way to make sport of the Left
in America was to mock their absurd use of the word “fascist.” It was
only the hardcore cranks who used the term, so even the conventional
Left would mock them for it. The left-wing crazy was the guy making his
own clothes and growling his own food, so he was not a prisoner of the
fascists running society. The joke relied on the fact that America was a
bourgeois society, so we did not have fascists or communists.

Of course, the term is everywhere now, as the rulers and their loyalists
wage jihad against our ancient liberties. The excuse for their excess is
they are fighting fascists, so it is okay. They have internalized their
mythology about themselves and the world around them to such a degree
they really think Donald Trump was some sort of fascist dictator
plotting to seize power. They are sure that the peaceful protest at the
Capitol was their version of the Reichstag fire.

This is the modern version of “the big lie.” Look around at what is
happening and it is as close as any western society has come to fascism
in 80 years. The people stripping the rights of Americans are not
government employees, but corporate powers. The vitriol from the
politicians may be the signal to act, but the people trying to destroy
Trump and his supporters are corporate actors, not the state.
Corporatism is a foundation stone of fascism and that is what is
usurping the authority of our system now.

In other words, the big lie here is that the people allegedly under
assault are the people wielding power. That is a lie so big that no one
would believe that someone “could have the impudence to distort the
truth so infamously.” The people with a monopoly of power are crying out
in agony as they crush their enemies. Their claims to be on defense are
a lie to distract from the fact they have assumed total power. Amazon
can offer murder for hire to prime members and no one can stop them.

This is the “the big lie” in neon. The people who are engaging in a
modern version of fascism are claiming to be the great enemies of
fascism. This leaves the genuine opponents of genuine fascism without a
language they can use. Calling what is happening Marxism is so stupid
only the dullards accept it. The communist would not have allowed the
tech giants off the leash. They would not have been slavishly in support
of the financialization of the economy.

Another part of this big lie is that over time the fans of the most
significant man in history have accepted the premise of the big lie as
their big truth. That is, fascism exclusively means opposition to
nonwhites. The result is we have the self-proclaimed fascists
reinforcing the premise put forward by the actual fascists that they
cannot possible be fascists, because they are not white. In this version
of the big lie, the fascists have created an enemy and put him to
service in their cause.

The thing with a lie, big or small, is it is like trying to conceal a
body. Like a body after a murder, no matter how well you hide the truth,
no matter how many layers of lies you throw on it, its absence is
noticed. This is the problem facing our new fascist overlords as they
scramble to consolidate their power. Whatever this new system is, people
know it is not democracy or constitutional government. No amount of
lying can change that realty and eventually, there will be a word for
it.
