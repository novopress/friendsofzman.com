While putting the show together, something that came to mind is how
people on our side seem to be getting wise to certain things. The old
gags are not working, at least not as well as they did in the past.
Those coming over the great divide have learned some hard lessons about
politics in the process. This is why Conservative Inc. has not been able
to spin the events of the last five years into new fundraising. Many
people really have caught onto their tricks.

Part of it is a greater awareness of the political grifter. Way back in
the Obama years, I would drop the word “grifter” into the comment
section of a conservative site and most of the responses were asking me
what the term meant. Ten years ago, no one used the term and very few
people talked about politics as a confidence game. Today the word
grifter is used all the time. There is a much greater awareness of the
political conmen and the tricks they play on the unsuspecting.

One result of this is people are less willing to get behind someone who
steps forward to present themselves as the next face of the cause. The
stories about groups like Proud Boys and Oaf Keepers being run by the
FBI has opened a lot of eyes. Increasingly, the default assumption is
that whoever the media is trying to elevate is not on the level or is
just an agent of the state. The FBI shenanigans over the last five years
has made many people into cynics when it comes to activism.

This is an example of unintended consequences. The best tool the system
had was to herd normal people into these false alternatives. For
generations conservatism was the place where normal people rallied to
defend themselves. It never worked, of course, but that was the point.
Without the Potemkin movements, it is going to be much more difficult
for the system to organize the resistance into dead end causes or have
them rally around fraudulent leaders.

It will make genuine organizing more difficult, but that is probably a
good thing as it will require better people. If you can easily get a mob
together online, and no one cares to check out the people in the mob, it
is easy pickings for the bad guys. When an organizer has to work hard to
gain trust and build his organization, you get a better class of
organizer. He is going to be much more circumspect about the sorts of
people he lets into his thing he worked so hard to build.

This is something that happened in Tsarist Russia. There was widespread
unhappiness with the system in the middle of the 19th century, but the
people organizing against the Tsar were low quality people. It took time
to move past that phase and to a place where you had serious men
building serious organizations of other serious men. The last decade of
the Soviet empire had a similar transition. Perhaps resistance must be
born of cynicism for it to be genuine resistance.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
