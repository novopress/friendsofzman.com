In a week of left-wing riots, it seemed logical to do a show on the
left-wing riots, so that’s what we have this week. There is so much
material here that I could probably do ten hours and not cover
everything. What we are seeing is the orchestrated suicide of the
country by the ruling class. This is a not a revolution from above, so
much a suicide from above. The new world these people imagine is less
plausible than what libertarians imagine or even what anarchist imagine.

I’m thinking specifically of the current calls to end the police. The
conventional conservatives are responding like the trained dogs they are
by rushing to defend the police state and the police themselves. Many
are combining the effort to prove the Democrats are the real racist with
their defense of the police state by finding black cops to hold up as
heroes. That sheriff from Wisconsin who wears the cowboy hat on TV must
be very busy right now. He’s a super hero!

The thing is, this system cannot survive a month without the cops. Take
the cops off the streets and the mob consumes the beautiful people
neighborhoods. The usual suspect will be swallowing their jewelry and
racing to the borders. All of the petty tyrants that have been pushing
us around for the last two months over the ridiculous virus panic will
be swinging from lamp posts. Not only will the mob lay waste to the
people in charge, the normal people quietly seething will be suddenly
unconstrained.

It is something that goes unremarked, but the cops exist to defend the
rich people and the ruling class. Anarcho-tyranny is impossible without
the cops. They are assigned to hassle normal people over petty things.
They are the ones harassing normal people while making sure the
spaghetti-armed Antifa types are safe. Go out this weekend and visit
ruling class areas or your government buildings. They will have a full
police presence, while the mob goes crazy in the cities.

That’s what is important about these calls to end the police. It is a
sign that the people in charge want to be put out of their misery. Their
self-hatred often manifests as hatred of us, but in reality, it is
hatred of self that is driving them. They hate themselves, so they hate
the world around them and they hate their ancestors who made it
possible. This zeal to erase the past and destroy the present is a form
of self-abnegation. They wish to erase their hated self as an extreme
act of contrition.

No one should prevent them from doing it. We’re long past the point of
defending society from the lunatics. There is nothing worth defending
now. Let them deal with this gollum they created. It would be endlessly
amusing seeing the mob chasing the beautiful people around in their
burning neighborhoods. Imagine the cast of the cable chat shows being
forced to grovel and plead to a mob of gentle giants. My goodness, that
would be the best television those people made in their lifetimes.

**Note:** I did an interview with the Mama & The Pepes earlier this
week. They run a music channel on D-Live called the White Art
Collective. The interview is recorded, as no one trusts me on a live
stream. I kid. It is just easier to record and edit these things than
coordinate doing them live. The interview is scheduled to air tonight on
their channel and 8:00 PM.
<a href="https://dlive.tv/WhiteArtCollective" rel="noopener noreferrer"

bucks if you can, I think they have a link on the site for it.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
