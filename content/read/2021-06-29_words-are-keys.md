It is a popular joke among the worst people that the best people need to
find a minority to endorse their preferences before they can express
them. In this context, the “best people” are the poohbahs of
Conservative Inc. No matter how obvious or justified their position,
so-called conservatives need to prove they are the best people by
searching high and low for a “person of color” who agrees with them.
Candace Owens has gotten rich by blessing the positions of
conservatives.

It is the slave mentality, of course. The master is always projecting
pride and power, as those are the things he values. He is the master,
the man in charge, so he places the most value on the things that are
useful to him as the master. The slave, on the other hand, is obsequious
and submissive. The slave tries to express his will through quiet
subversion, always conscious of the master. In American politics,
conservatives are the slave, always displaying their submissiveness.

You see this with the growing controversy over Critical Race Theory.
Conservative Inc. was silent on the issue until a black women stood up
against it at a local school board meeting in Virginia. You could hear
the sighs of relief echoing around Washington as conservatives finally
had their champion. This antiwhite pogrom aimed at white children was no
longer antiwhite, it was racist! Ever since, the conservative
panjandrums have been piling in the company Lincoln with the DR3 tags.

Even Chris Rufo, the Andy Ngo of CRT, has struggled to accept the
reality of his own reporting on the issue. He has been trying hard to
make this about racism, rather than the long war on white people. He has
personal reasons for it, but it is clear that he really <a
href="https://media.gab.com/system/media_attachments/files/077/888/549/original/5747539427f89cff.jpeg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">believes</a> what they say about white
people. That is, if two or more white people get together outside the
presence of nonwhites, they will immediately start planning for the new
camp system in the Fourth Reich.

That last bit may seem like an exaggeration, but it is the root of what
drives things like Critical Race Theory. Another person desperate to
tone police, while riding the wave of controversy, is Karlyn Borysenko.
She was sent in by the usual suspects to tell white people that the term
“antiwhite” is very bad. Here she is with Patrick Casey explaining that
the term antiwhite promotes white solidarity and white positivity. In
<a href="https://youtu.be/iESmyLtqBfI?t=212" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this clip</a>, she says that this always leads to
genocide.

In fairness to Rufo, he seems to have figured out that he was speaking
to no one by making CRT about racism against nonwhites. The parents
flipping out about this stuff are all white. The people in the crowd
cheering them on are white. He seems to have settled for a middle ground
of implying that it is antiwhite racism. <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2021/06/27/critical-race-theory-is-just-anti-white-racism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Greer</a> seems to be happy with
that phrasing as well. The
<a href="https://archive.is/KfLH2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wall
Street Journal</a> is fine with this new, oblique way of framing the
issue.

As was brilliantly
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/watch-your-language/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> yesterday, the R-word can
only apply to whites, so this new formulation is nonsensical. When
someone on the Left hears the phrase “racism against whites” she hears
Charlie Brown’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ss2hULhXf04" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">teacher</a>. Racism can mean only one thing and that is
prejudice plus power. In the fantasy world of the Left, the only people
with power are white people, so they are the only people who can be
racist. As is always the case with the Left, compromise is suicide.

The reason for this is that the Left is a hive, dividing the world into
those inside the hive walls and those outside the hive walls. This is
reflected in their language. There are words and concepts that can be
used as weapons against their enemies and then there is language used by
the enemy, that justifies attacking them. When the say language is
violence, they really mean it. It is either a justification for their
use of violence against outsiders or a call to violence against
outsiders.

This is why the word “antiwhite” is so powerful. The Left has no way to
redefine it as a slur against their enemy. Worse yet, when they attack
their enemy for using it, they confirm the definition of the word. The
biggest problem for them is the word strips them of moral authority.
When the Left finger-wags about something like racism, they do so as the
moral authorities on the issue. Cast as antiwhite, they immediately
become just another snout at the trough of the culture war.

The Left has always relied upon informational asymmetry. They operate as
pure partisans, while the other side is objectivists. That is, the Left
wants to win every fight and the Right wants to find the correct answer.
If the Right ever embraces partisanship, then it becomes a genuine
fight. Since numbers matter, keeping white people chained to
simpleminded individualism has been key. The word antiwhite is a key to
unlock the chains and that is terrifying to the Left.

This does not mean the war is won just because the Left is on the
defensive over Critical Race Theory. As Joe Sobran pointed out a quarter
century ago, “The white  
man presents an image of superiority even when he isn’t conscious of it.
And superiority excites envy.” It is only when white people come to
terms with this reality will they abandon the slave mentality and begin
to assert their power again. This minor slave revolt over CRT is merely
a hint of what lies ahead.
