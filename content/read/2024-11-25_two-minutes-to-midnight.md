Last week, NATO began firing long range missiles into Russia and in
response the Russians fired something entirely new at Ukraine. There is
not much data on what it was and what it did, but the Russians claim it
was their Oreshnik system, which is a type of intermediate-range
missile. The Ukrainians, of course, claim it never happened and Western
media is saying it was a ballistic missile. Whatever it was is serious
enough to warrant an emergency NATO meeting this week.

From independent sources, the most likely answer is that the Russians
demonstrated the first combat use of a hypersonic glide vehicle in this
attack. The word “hypersonic” gets tossed around quite about by online
“geopolitical analysts” because it is a cool sounding word that is often
used in video games. There is nothing all that new about hypersonic
missiles, as many long-range ballistic missiles reach or exceed Mach 5
as they descend toward their target.

In fact, there is nothing new about hypersonic glide vehicles. The
Russians started working on this technology in the 1960’s. America also
had a program testing this technology for weapons. Both sides of the
Cold War figured out that traditional ballistic missiles were good
enough for the job of terrifying the other side with the prospect of
nuclear annihilation, so the technology never went into use. The cost of
hypersonic vehicles was simply too high for the task.

There was another problem with hypersonic glide vehicles. Traveling
through the atmosphere at those speeds made them impossible to hide.
Satellites would be able to track them as soon as they were launched and
ground radar would then also be able to track them, even if they have
some maneuverability. A pretty good rule of air defense is that if it
can be tracked it can be killed. At the minimum, the other side sees it
coming and has time to get its own missiles in the air.

That is a bit of the arms race that has been forgotten. It was not just
the race to have the most devastating warheads, but also a race to have
the best detection systems and the best cloaking system. If the other
side could not anticipate your launch or see it coming right away, you
had an obvious advantage. This is why both sides eventually banned
intermediate range missiles in Europe in 1987. The United States
unilaterally withdrew from the treaty in 2019.

The intermediate range missile presents a big problem if your goal is to
avoid wiping out mankind in a nuclear war. Because it can hit its target
in less than thirty minutes, there is no way to respond, short of
mag-dumping your ICBM’s. By the time the launch is detected, the
missiles are closing in on the target. Missile defense in the nuclear
scenario depends on hitting them in their boost phase or as they leave
the atmosphere to prevent them from exploding over your territory.

It is unclear when the Russians resumed their intermediate missile
program, but it was probably not long after the U.S. withdrew from the
treaty. It is not all that clear when the Russians resumed working on
hypersonic glide vehicles either. There is growing evidence that they
have been collaborating with the Chinese on this project, because last
year the Chinese demonstrated a hypersonic weapon. It combined a
hypersonic glide vehicle and a fractional orbital bombardment system.

That last bit is another clue that the Chinese have been working with
the Russians on this project, as the fractional orbital bombardment
system is technology that dates to the Soviet Union. The Russians first
developed this technology in the 1960s for its nuclear program. Unlike a
ballistic missile, the FOBS only reaches low-earth orbit and can then
deorbit over the target. This makes it very hard to track, because the
warhead does not follow a predictable path.

When the Chinese demonstrated the combined use of FOBS and hypersonic
glide vehicles, American military planners had a panic attack. General
Milley famously compared it to Sputnik, by which he meant a moment when
the West suddenly realized it had fallen behind the Soviets in space
technology. Everyone dismissed his comments, because he is a notorious
liar, but he may have been right. The possible use of this type of
weapon by the Russians likely proves it.

The Russians have not said much about this system, other than stating
that the West has no defense against it. The usual suspects are claiming
that it is just an old intermediate missile system, and the Ukrainians
say it was an ICBM. What we know is that minutes after it was launched,
multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles slammed into targets
in Ukraine at speeds above Mach 5. Some claim Mach 10, but that is
probably an exaggeration, but Mach 5 is still very fast.

What this means is that the Russians, if sufficiently provoked, could
remove any European city from the game board in a matter of minutes.
There is no defense and not much of a warning to the target country. If
France, for example, starts firing SCALP missiles into Russia, Paris
could cease to exist within a few minutes of someone telling Macron that
he better say his prayers. It is easy to see why the deployment of such
a weapon is so terrifying to fans of human civilization.

Of course, it is why the treaty banning the development of such weapons
was viewed as an important step in deescalating the Cold War. This
technology puts the world on a hair trigger with no time to pause for
communication with the other side. It is also why the neocons
desperately wanted the U.S. to withdraw from the deal. John Bolton was
instrumental is convincing American officials to pull out of the treaty.
In 2018, politicians still thought listening to psychopaths was a good
idea.

The path to this point is a familiar one. The neocons first invent a
threat, in this case the threat was that China and Iran were developing
intermediate range weapons. There was little evidence of this, but that
never matters. This is then turned into a justification for the United
States to do something stupid. Famously, the invasion of Iraq was based
on the entirely false assertion that Iraq was building doomsday weapons.
It turned out that they only had WW1 vintage chemical weapons.

For the next two months, the psychopaths are still in charge of Ukraine
policy, so they will no doubt keep poking the bear. It is pretty clear
they want the Russians to use nukes in Ukraine. They have been yapping
about it since 2022. That means the NATO meeting this week will be about
getting the Germans to start launching their Taurus missiles at Russia.
The excuse will be that they need to call the Russian bluff, but the
real reason is they want a reason to fire the nukes themselves.

It remains to be seen if Trump is up for the difficult task of
deescalating the arms race with China and Russia. He fell for every
trick Washington could muster the first time, even some tricks they
invented just for him. He seems to be set on keeping the neocons out of
his administration this time. Even so, he will inherent a world that is
now infinitely more dangerous thanks to the reckless behavior of the
Biden admin. Simply surviving the next term might be the best he can do.
