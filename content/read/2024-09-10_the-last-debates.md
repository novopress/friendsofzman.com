The first and possibly last presidential debate of this cycle is
scheduled for tonight in Philadelphia between Donald Trump and Kamala
Harris. Given the result of the last Trump – Biden debate, this one
should get a good audience. Despite the massive marketing campaign on
her behalf, people know little about Harris. She has been a colored
ornament on the Biden administration and the butt of jokes on the
internet, but most people have no genuine sense of her.

That is the reason it could be the last debate of this cycle. Harris has
a poor reputation as a public speaker. Her only real debate experience
was in the 2020 Democratic primary and she was horrible. Despite having
millions in tech money and a favorable media, she used the debate to
alienate every constituency in the party and dropped out soon after it.
Her recent CNN interview, which was heavily edited, suggests she has not
gotten better over the last four years.

It is possible this may be the last presidential debate we see at all.
It is assumed that debates are part of the show, but for most of the
country’s history debates were not a part of our political process. The
first general election debate in our history was the 1960 debate between
John Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Prior to that, there were a few debates
between members of the Democratic party on specific issues like foreign
policy, but those were a rarity.

After the Kennedy – Nixon debates, which were a great success in the
sense that they captured the attention of the public, there were no more
debates until 1976 when Gerald Ford debated Jimmy Carter three times.
The logic behind this series of debates was that neither of the
candidates were well known. Carter was the surprise winner of the
Democratic nomination and Ford fell into the Oval Office after Nixon
resigned in the wake of the Watergate coup against him.

Since then, we have had debates every cycle, but they stopped being
debates in the normal sense, devolving into choregraphed media contests.
The candidates come equipped with canned one-liners they practice before
the event. They hope to use one of them to win headlines. The moderators
do the same thing, usually in collaboration with the Democratic
candidate. No one remembers the content of these things because there is
no content to our debates. They are emotive gibberish.

This will become clear in the opening statements tonight. Harris will
repeat the abracadabra words and phrases that are supposed to trigger
good feelings for the target audience of her campaign. She will quickly
chant the abracadabra words and phrases that are supposed to get these
same people angry at Trump. In his unscripted way, Trump will attempt to
do the same thing. Both candidates could be replaced with lights that
flash green for good and red for bad.

If Harris is terrible again in this debate, then they most likely pull
the plug on the rest of them, including the Vance – Walz debate. Trump
would have no need for a rematch and Harris would have no reason to take
another beating. It also may be why the whole general election debate
concept ends this year. From the perspective of the regime, there is
nothing to debate, so why have debates? It was clear over the last month
that the regime was not excited about having these things.

The debate concept we have now was a response to the chaos of the 1960’s
and 1970’s, which was created by the ruling class, and then the
Watergate coup to remove Richard Nixon. The presidential debates were
designed to turn the page on the prior decades of cultural chaos and
convince people that the political class had regained its mental
stability. The ruling class had settled its difference in the wake of
the civil rights revolution and was ready to discuss the new consensus.

Prior to the Carter – Ford debate, there was nothing to debate, at least
nothing that required public attention. The legal and cultural battles
that often played out on the streets in the 60’s and 70’s reflected the
debate within the ruling class. Those first presidential debates
reflected the new consensus. Once the issues had been settled, then the
public could be allowed to see the results. The result was the
presidential debate format within the new moral order.

Something similar to the revolutions from above in the middle of the
last century has played out in the post-Cold War period. The
triumphalism of the Clinton and Bush years gave way to the collapse in
confidence of the Obama years. The chaos of the last decade reflects the
collapsing confidence of the ruling class. The abolition of rights, the
pogroms and censorship all point to a time when the regime simply
decides there is nothing to debate and puts an end to all public debate.

Another way of putting it is that after the radicals within the ruling
class won the fight, the debate concept emerged as part of a strategy to
normalize their victory. Note that in the first debates, none of the
major issues of the prior decade were discussed. Both sides were ready
to move on to practical issues like the economy and how best to deal
with the Soviet Union. No one mentioned the riots and the violence, much
less questioned the new civil rights regime.

At the other end of that story arc which began with the Brown decision,
the regime is in full control, but paranoid and insecure. The response
to Trump and populism was not to confidently confront it and “set it
straight” but to use any means necessary to avoid exposing the logic of
the regime to the crucible of reason. If Trump wins in November, you can
be sure the response will be a renewed pogrom against white people and
the rights they assume to be their inheritance.

Win or lose, the lesson the regime will take away from this election is
that there is no reason for debates anymore. There is nothing to debate.
More important, maintaining the idea that it is acceptable to question
the prevailing orthodoxy just leads to misinformation and
disinformation. The only thing left to do is to create a narrative that
explains why ending debate is vital to our democracy. If they can say
free speech is a threat to democracy, ending debates is no great
challenge.
