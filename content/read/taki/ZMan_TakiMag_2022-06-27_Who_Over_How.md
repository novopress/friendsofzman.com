The Supreme Court of the United States finally handed down its decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization_ , the landmark abortion case. The court ruled that the Constitution does not provide a right to an abortion, thus overturning _Roe v. Wade_ and the logic behind the decision. Clarence Thomas suggested that this will lead to the overturning of other cases reliant on such imaginative jurisprudence.

The usual suspects are out in the streets setting fires and smashing windows demanding something. Whenever the far-left crazies do not get 100 percent of what they want, they take to the streets and start smashing things. This is how their corporate handlers let them blow off steam. Those corporate handlers were quick to let them know that HR will be [there](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818201816/https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/jpmorgan-tells-employees-the-bank-will-pay-for-travel-to-states-that-allow-abortion.html) for them once they are done with the tantrums.

Right there is one of those mileposts that reveal just how much America has changed in the past fifty years. Abortion used to be an issue fought between white lesbians and Christian mothers. The former argued that abortion was a feminist sacrament that magically made women on par with men. The latter argued that it was just another step in stripping women of the natural respect they command in a just society.

“If a society has the right people in charge, people with a natural attachment to society, they will make decisions in the public interest.”

Interestingly, the other side of the issue has been subdued in response to what is their one and only victory in the culture war. Many of the people who made social conservatism a force on the right have been dead for a generation. Others simply got tired of waiting and moved on to other issues. Fifty years is a long time to wait for the conservative movement to deliver on a promise.

Conservative Inc. is also struggling with this one. Their whole model is based on losing gracefully, so they are unprepared for an actual victory. Crisis counselors have been called to American Enterprise and Heritage to help the staff cope with something they were told could never happen. For professional conservatives, _Dobbs_ is like seeing Big Foot riding a unicorn. They are questioning their sanity.

What makes this even more difficult for Conservative Inc. is the fact that _Dobbs_ was made possible by their archnemesis, Donald Trump. In his debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump made clear that abortion would be a litmus test issue for him when it came time to select judges for the court. His matter-of-fact [explanation](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818201816/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfdRmnT0Weo) for how he would roll back _Roe_ was mocked at the time, but it turned out to be correct.

Ben Shapiro [attacked](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818201816/https://archive.ph/S1Q6H) Trump and Trump supporters for thinking that it was possible to stack the court with judges who would follow through on their claims. Shapiro was sure that Trump was not only lying, but too stupid to understand how the court worked and how the nomination process worked. He also claimed that Trump lacked the stones to stand up to the left when it came to judges.

Unsurprisingly, Shapiro was wrong on all counts. This will have no impact on his status within the conservative echo chamber, as being wrong is universal. One of the many reasons conservatism is nothing more than a legacy grift right now is that no one in the movement ever paid a price for being wrong. Instead, being wrong turned into a weird status symbol that elevated the stupid over the intelligent.

Of course, this should inform the ongoing debate about the future of conservatism that is happening in various quarters. Many have argued that appointing originalist judges would not result in conservative ends. Chief among them is the Harvard academic Adrian Vermeule, who [claimed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818201816/https://iusetiustitium.com/the-end-of-originalism/) that the court would never take up _Dobbs_ , and even if they did, they would never overturn _Roe_.

Although they probably do not see it, the _Dobbs_ decision cuts the legs out from under the New Right just as it does Conservative Inc. Both sides of this debate claim that _how_ things are done is what matters. In reality, it is _who_ , not _how_. Who decides is what matters in the law and in social policy. If a society has the right people in charge, people with a natural attachment to society, they will make decisions in the public interest.

This is why the most unhinged opposition to Trump came from the neocons. They have always been the brains of Conservative Inc., and they correctly saw what the Trump phenomenon represented to them. Trump was not running to promote a process but on the promise that he and he alone could make the required changes. His campaign was an explicit appeal to the _who_ rather than the _how_.

In the end, _Dobbs_ will not change much about abortion in America. The states will arrive at policies that match their inclinations. In other words, the issue will quickly fold into the normal process of government. That was always the right answer, but the people promoting abortion opposed this because it made it impossible for them to impose _their_ morality on the rest of society. Again, _who_ versus _how_.

The real impact of _Dobbs_ is in reminding the white remnant that what matters is who decides, not how they decide. For generations they have been told by their betters that process is their greatest virtue. It took a billionaire bumpkin from beyond the pale to prove that process is a tool. In the hands of good men, it results in good ends. In the hands of alien rulers, the best process leads to bad ends.
