The opposite rule of liberalism says that whatever the Left is saying,
you should start with the opposite and that is where you will probably
find the truth. For example, if they are accusing one of their bogeymen
of something, most likely the target is not doing it and is not the bad
guy. Odds are, it is the Left engaging in the activity. Whether it is
latent guilt or deliberate distraction, the Left tends to accuse others
of the things they are doing or plan to do in the future.

It is not always simple like we learned with the Russian collusion hoax.
The Left is fond of creating elaborate and plausible concepts that they
can use to frame issues so that they are the default moral position.
Homosexual marriage is an example where they inverted the morality of
the issue. Normal people felt the need to explain why we should maintain
normal marriage, as if it was a novel concept. The opposite, of course,
was the truth but it was hard for people to see it.

The idea of the social construct is a good example of how it is not easy
to tease out the truth from what the Left is saying. It is tempting to
use the opposite rule of liberalism and say that there is no such thing
as a social construct. Something like sex is obviously not an invented
thing and people are not assigned sex at birth. While their concept of
gender is nonsense, there are gender roles in society. These are closely
tied to biological sex and the natural differences between the sexes.

Where the opposite rule of liberalism applies in regard to something
like social constructs is that it is not the normal world that is a
construct but rather how the Left engages with the world that is a
creation of their mind. Like the simple example of the Russian collusion
hoax, the Left is accusing Mother Nature of creating constructs of the
mind when it is the Left that is doing it. In fact, everything about the
Left relies on an invented moral framework that does not exist in
realty.

A good example of this is the “hate researcher”. There are people
running around now with that title. Another flavor of this is the
extremism expert. Whenever the media wants to label someone a heretic
and have them hurled into the void, they call on people with one of
these titles. The target is identified, the hate researcher provides the
“data” proving that this person meets the definition of a hater or
extremist, and therefore they deserve to be hurled into the void.

The fact that there can be no such thing as a hate researcher, or an
extremism expert is never questioned. Hate is an entirely subjective
term as used by the Left. It does not actually mean an intense or
passionate dislike. Instead, they have created a new definition that
means something close to unorthodox and taboo. Most of the people
accused of being a hater do not, in fact, hate anyone. They simply
disagree from the prevailing orthodoxy with regards to the human
condition.

Of course, “extreme” is and must be an entirely subjective term.
Extremes are relative, so it all depends upon your perspective. People
into “extreme sports” are not all that crazy to the people in those
sports. Someone holding an extreme opinion is only considered to be an
extremist in relation to others. Researching extremism, beyond
explaining the subjectivity of the term and how it is used, is like
researching UFO encounters or Big Foot sightings.

What the Left has done is create a moral framework. Inside the framework
are the acceptable truths and outside are the taboo ideas. Wrong and
right are not determined by factual accuracy but by the rules of the
moral framework. Accepting the facts of table 43 of the Uniform Crime
Report is wrong even though it is factual accurate. When the Left
accuses the world of creating social constructs, it is because
everything about their understanding of the world is through a social
construct.

The hate expert and extremism researcher are similarly inventions that
can only exist within the rules of the moral framework. In actuality
there is no such thing and can be no such thing without the warped moral
code of the Left. What the Left is doing, what they are expert at doing,
is creating the required social constructs that allow them to
anathematize things that contradict their current beliefs. It is how
something can go from taboo to virtuous in the blink of an eye.

Another good example of this is the concept of “racism”. It is another
invention that does not exist in the real world. The Left defines this
as prejudice plus power and power is only held by white people. The
reason for that is society is a social construct made by and for white
people. This mean the lowliest white guy has power, while Barak Obama is
his powerless victim. Therefore, by definition, the only people who can
be racist are white people, because they have power.

It is only in the matrix of the Left’s fantasy world that this idea can
seem real. The moral concept of racism would have been baffling to
people a century ago. Prejudice was certainly something people have
always known. They also considered it perfectly normal as tastes are
subjective. Some people hate lima beans while others love them, but that
says nothing about the nature of lima beans. The same applies to
people’s taste in other people and other tribes.

This is why clarity of language is such a powerful weapon against the
Left, even when wielded by crude people. When a leftist uses the term
“hate speech” and someone corrects them with “you mean taboo speech”
they will get very nervous. At some level, the Left knows the moral
world they inhabit is a fiction. Using clear language to turn the lights
on and expose the fiction is horrifying to them. Their fantasy world
works only when they can commit to it totally.

Maintaining this fictional moral universe may be why the Left is so
prone to accusing others of what they are doing. It is a defense
mechanism. By shifting the focus to outside their safe zone, they get to
avoid see the reality of their world. It is an extension of their
natural self-loathing. The fictional world replaces their hated sense of
self and the projection onto enemies of their own fears about themselves
provides a necessary distraction from the reality of their condition.
