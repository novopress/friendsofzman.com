I am enjoying the mass panic and evacuation of South Florida at the
moment, but I expect to be out of here by the time Godzilla strikes. The
hosting service where this site resides, however, is located in path of
the monster. These companies are pretty tough these days, with power
generators and redundancy, but there is always a chance things go very
bad. If this site is dark for some reason, the most likely reason is the
hurricane. Or, they finally came for me, but the most likely reason is
weather.

Best of luck to all of those in the path of the storm.
