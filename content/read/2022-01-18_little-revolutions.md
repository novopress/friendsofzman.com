Revolutions come when people suddenly realize that everyone else is
privately thinking the same things about the current arrangements. Most
people tend to keep their grievances private. Complaining is boring and
considered bad form even in the worst of times, so people tend to keep
their grievances to themselves. It is when they begin to notice that
everyone else has similar complaints that the cascading effect turns
complaints into demands and then into rebellion.

It is why the corporate communists who dominate the official social
media platforms like Twitter are more deluded than they seem. Their
entire public life is nothing but a litany of complaints, shared with
other miserable wrecks on-line. They literally know everyone who shares
their grievances, as they are all in the same groups. The only awakening
that will happen from their endless griping is that the rest of society
will realize that these people are nuts and need to be pushed back to
the fringe.

A version of that took place a couple of weeks ago when Douglas Murray
was assigned the task of purging Pedro Gonzalez. Murray took issue with
Gonzalez making sport of various internationalist types on Twitter.
Gonzalez was doing the “physiognomy is real” thing where he posted pics
of the people he was mocking. Murray <a
href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/when-the-right-plays-with-jew-hate"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">responded</a> with, “Mr. Gonzalez spent
his holiday weekend bringing what many have worked hard to relegate to
the gutter into respectable conservative circles.”

This is an old stand-by for the neocons. Starting in the 1980’s they
have slandered anyone who opposed their sociopathic agenda as
anti-Semites or racists. The fact that the favorite tool of
neoconservatism has always been the favorite tool of the far-left is not
an accident. Despite their claims, the neocons were never conservative.
Theirs is an ideology of the Left. They imagine a new world order where
they sit atop as the moral arbiters, using extreme force to impose their
will.

That incident was not all that interesting, but what is interesting is
that few people bother to notice and those who did mocked Douglas
Murray. His own comment section reads like satire cooked up by the
anti-Semites. Many had to be trolls having a laugh at the expense of the
geezers. On Twitter, Murray was mocked as a relic from an age in which
people were still fooled by neoconservatives. Gonzalez just laughed the
whole thing off as the rantings of an old man.

While a tempest in a teapot, there was a time when a bigfoot chattering
skull like Murray could have someone thrown into the void this way. Bill
Buckley was used this way back in the 1990’s when Bill Kristol forced
him to denounce Buchanan. This trick worked thirty years ago but today
it gets little more than a shrug. What people did notice is that it did
not work. The ad hominem and guilt by association stuff is no longer the
super weapon it was thirty years ago. The world has changed.

It is not just that these tactics do not work it is that they
increasingly sound like the rantings of old people complaining about the
world changing. This <a href="https://archive.is/iJZQR" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">column</a> from George Will before Christmas is a good
example. His quill pen act was effective into the Bush years, but now it
seems anachronistic and a bit ridiculous, like a man wearing a denim
jacket with “disco forever” spelled out in rhinestones on the back. It
reads like something that should have been written 40 years ago.

The tattered look of these old tactics also reveals the general
shabbiness of the arguments behind the name calling. Will’s claims about
individualism are pure nonsense and his claim that nationalism is
collectivism is ridiculous. How did this man get through high school
with such nonsense in his head? In other words, the datedness makes it
easier to see that these people were never smart. Neoconservatism, like
so-called conservatism, was a tactic, not a set of ideas.

It is not just among the chattering skulls that we are seeing a change.
All of sudden, without anyone noticing, Gab is no longer the bogeyman.
Hundreds of right-wing pols have joined and legitimate political players
like Rasmussen have joined because they see that is where the crowd is
going, the crowd they need to survive. People have noticed that the
biggest players on the planet tried to destroy Torba and his company,
but he simply refused to buckle to them.

Of course, this change in attitudes reflects the growing divide in
society. <a
href="https://summit.news/2022/01/17/poll-finds-close-to-half-of-democratic-voters-want-covid-internment-camps-for-the-unvaccinated/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half</a> of the people who voted for Joe
Biden support internment camps for dissidents and house arrest for the
non-complaint. Behind every double mask is someone who would volunteer
to be a camp guard. One of the causes of revolution is that there is
always some portion of society willing to support the regime. Disordered
minds seek the order of the bloody fist imposing its will on society.

Those people, the fringe crazies who have been allowed to run free in
the public square, are a fixture in human society. A central part of
every human society is maintaining the rules that define the society.
This means keeping the crazies under control and away from the levers of
power. That is, perhaps, what we are beginning to see with these recent
events. People are rejecting the moral claims of these people and living
their lives in spite of them.

There is a great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAtlyewU3To" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">scene</a> in the movie Braveheart in which the main
character captures the leader of the kings guard. He looks down at
first, as was required when addressing a superior man, but then he looks
up into the man’s eyes as an equal. It is a great scene, because it
reflects how control is exercised and broken. It seems that many are now
willing to look moral scoundrels like Murray in the eyes and give them
the treatment they so richly deserve.
