There is a cult like quality to the fake nerd stuff we see in the
culture. A lot of these people, particularly the young ones, think they
are part of a movement that will make this world like the imaginary one
in sci-fi movies. The web site Tech Crunch seems to be one of their
propaganda organs. It looks like they are also <a

The word “disrupt” is a buzzword borrowed from economics that is very
popular in the fake nerd world. Every startup begging for money peppers
its prospectus with this word. The reader is supposed to think the new
company is a part of the glorious future where we all live in gleaming
cities run on rainbow dust, where everyone is happy and there are no
poor people. The future for these people is a sanitized San Francisco
without the gays.

I’ll note the picture they use. You have two sexless people who possess
that innocent, Eloi quality so popular with the fake nerd crowd. The one
on the left is slightly Oriental, while the one of the right is
Occidental. Maybe they are boys or maybe they are girls. We’re not
supposed to know. If someone used this picture for a NAMBLA campaign, no
one would be surprised. That’s the creepy part of the glorious future.
It’s primary appeal seems to be to men who really like boys.
