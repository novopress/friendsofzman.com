For a long time, the phrase “13-do-50” has turned up in conversations
about crime because it is something of a universal truth. Both numbers
are a shorthand and not precise, but everyone gets the deeper meaning. A
more accurate statement would be something like “6-do-50” or “3-do-30”
but convenient shorthand works because it does not get too deep in the
weeds. In this case, the “13-do-50” phrase speaks to the demographic
reality behind the numbers.

We could also use a similar phrase for the people behind the cultural
mayhem that has racked American society. About 20% of white people in
America self-identify as left-wing, liberal or Progressive. This has
held up over generations. It is this group that is responsible of 100%
of the stress in society. They are always behind whatever is causing
cultural chaos. The phase “20-do-100” does not roll off the tongue like
the other expression, but it captures reality.

Think about it. If we rounded up these people and shipped them to
Africa, even on a one-for-one swap, America would look like Switzerland.
The remaining white people would junk all of the nutty cultural rules.
Politically, the center would move so far to the right that Ted Cruz
would be the Bernie Sanders of Congress. America’s crime problem would
be solved with free associations and healthy intolerance. The mass media
would shrivel up to a local news service.

Granted, some people would wriggle through the net. No doubt this mind
virus would find some new hosts in the remnant population. Nothing is
perfect but if the manifestations of this disease come to be treated
like leprosy, the new hosts would simply be deported as soon as they
reveal themselves. A society organized around opposition to post-Marx
culturalism would not be perfect, but it would be stable and as a
result, able to defend itself from this plague.

Such a plan is easier said than done. Deporting forty-five million
people is no small task, but we take in about two million a year
officially. Another two million come in illegally, so with some
planning, we could probably deport ten million a year. Many would flee
on their own making the task easier. On the other hand, there would be
people who showed sympathy for these people. This has always been the
weakness the 20%ers have exploited. They turn virtue into vice.

Of course, the first step in such a scheme is getting the 80% or at
least a critical mass of them, to accept that there can be no compromise
with the 20%ers. For reasons that are no longer worth exploring, these
people are beyond the reach of reason so there is no point in trying to
reason with them. They are simply a menace to society that must be
removed in order to save the whole. The road back from the brink begins
with the complete anathematization of the 20%er.
