Depending upon when you mark the start of the Covid mass hysteria, we
are either coming up on the one year anniversary or have just past it.
Panic was setting in as early as January, but that was mostly with
people who saw a profit in it. It was in February when the mass media
started picking up on it. For example, no one was wearing a mask at CPAC
2020, which was in February. By March you could not buy a mask anywhere,
along with toiletries and paper products.

A year on, we are getting a better picture of what happened in what may
go down as one of the great mass panics in human history. Given that the
panic is still with us, the picture that is emerging is blurry and
incomplete. In parts of the US and Europe, Covid has turned into a weird
religion. It is not just a public health issue to be managed and
navigated, but a stand-in for Old Scratch. The faithful are not only
vigilant, they are Covid vigilantes, minding everyone’s business about
it.

One thing we are seeing is a
<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/covid-19-cases-down-16-233021005.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">collapse in the number of confirmed
cases</a>. This is in line with what we know about past pandemics. The
number of cases is slow at first, often because we have no way of
testing for the new bug. Then the number of cases rises quickly, partly
due to awareness and partly due to panic. In the mass media age, the
need for attention surely drove the case count. Contrary to <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/plummeting-cases-in-u-s-show-a-path-to-crushing-covid-19/ar-BB1dIHkz"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">media narratives</a>, the drop in cases
has nothing to do with government efforts.

In fact, there is <a
href="https://mises.org/wire/almost-year-later-theres-still-no-evidence-showing-governments-can-control-spread-covid-19"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">no evidence</a> that any of the measures,
public or private, had any impact on the spread of Covid. The fact is
the only way to slow the spread of a virus like this is what the Chinese
did and that is lock everyone in their homes. Even the Chinese found
this to be close to impossible. What the West could do and is doing is
theater. It is about protecting the political health of the ruling
class, by convincing enough people that the government is doing
something about the virus.

Political theater is an essential element of liberal democracy. We live
in the modern version of a
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=18116" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Dionysian age</a>. All public acts are public
performances, and all public performances are part of the larger
morality play of politics. Facts and the discourse upon facts is purely
a private affair. It is why everything about Covid has been politicized
and only came to our attention when it could be politicized. For a year
we have been watching
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=20077" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Covid theater</a>, rather than a public health response.

Once the drama runs its course on the big stage, and it seems to be
reaching that point now that Mumbly Joe is staggering around the White
House, it will go off-Broadway and then close up shop entirely. The mass
roll out of vaccines with highly questionable claims to effectiveness
looks like the way out for government. Once the old people are
vaccinated, they can then claim herd immunity has been reached and the
rest of the public can get the jab at their leisure.

One caveat to that prediction is that the Covidians are getting worked
up over the new strain of Covid. This is the super-Covid that the
oracles prophesied back in the before times when this all started. <a
href="https://news.yahoo.com/californias-coronavirus-strain-looks-increasingly-130055544.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This one</a> is “armed with enhanced
capabilities.” Apparently it has infrared vision and portable drones.
Additionally, <a
href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/can-a-fourth-wave-of-covid-19-be-prevented-not-likely-says-fred-hutch-model-but-the-curve-could-be-flattened/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Nth wave people</a> will be with us
forever, it seems. Then you have the Covid industrial complex that has
invested heavily in lockdowns and all that surrounds it.

Assuming that the panic does end, and this drama moves off the stage
this year, we will also start to get a sense of the degree of madness we
have witnesses. For example, we are already getting a hint in the annual
flu numbers. In Britain, the number of influenza cases was <a
href="https://summit.news/2021/02/23/uk-health-authorities-announce-not-a-single-case-of-flu-detected-this-year/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">zero</a> this flu season. Maybe we have
witnessed a miracle or maybe Covid kills the influenza virus. Most
likely, the flu numbers have been re-classed as Covid, which <a
href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/the-unexpected-case-of-the-disappearing-flu-64fd1fa5e909"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">appears to be the case</a> in the US.

The truth is most cases we call the flu are caused by unknown pathogens.
In fact, only about 20% of flu cases treated by the medical system are
known to be the flu. The rest are from something else. Since the
medicines for treating the symptoms do the job, no one really cares what
caused the symptoms. It is why we do not mandate testing for the flu or
the common cold. Up until the past year, we just accepted the fact that
people get sick in winter and sometimes need to be treated for it.

Once the dust settles and the sober minded can begin to look at the
data, what we will find is that the number of deaths was wildly
exaggerated. Similarly, the number of people needing hospitalization was
also exaggerated. This is common to all pandemics in the modern age.
Even the Spanish Flu was exaggerated. A lot of the deaths attributed to
it were from other factors, like poor hospital conditions, poorly
trained doctors, bad nutrition, and other pathogens.

Another lesson will be that modern government is not capable of managing
a genuine crisis, even a mild one like Covid. The story emerging from
New York shows that the people making the decisions not only lacked the
basic skills to manage a crisis, but they were obsessed with the
politics of the moment. Like everything about partisan politics,
everyone chose sides. The left-wing states chose first, so the
right-wing states were left with the right answer by default. That is no
way to run a country.

It is not just a partisan political problem. It is a systemic one.
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1376/htm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">This paper</a> examining the political economy of this
panic looks at the role of mass media. The initial reality of the virus
was amplified by the mass media, which the decision makers in government
rely upon as their primary information source. They acted on the
exaggerated claims, which had the effect of confirming those claims to
the public. This was picked up and magnified by the media and we had a
vicious cycle.

The interesting bit in that paper is the parallel between how a virus
spreading faster in a dense population and how panic spreads in a media
dense population. Before the mass media age, most people were outside
the media environment, in the same way most people were outside urban
areas in agrarian times. Just as a pathogen needs a network of people,
bad information needs a way to pass from person to person. Our connected
age is now a breeding ground for informational pandemics.

Another aspect to this is a growing number of people seem to need the
emotional energy that comes from crisis. We saw this in the early days
of Covid. The auxiliary volunteer army of scolds were suddenly swarming
the public square. That energy eventually transferred to fighting the
virus that they call Trump supporters and insurrectionists but is now
looking for a new host. They will need another panic this spring and you
can be sure one will be supplied.

adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
