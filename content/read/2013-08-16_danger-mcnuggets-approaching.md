rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stories like this</a> are why Al Gore
invented the Interwebs. In the olden times, this type of story would
never get published, outside of some weird mailing list run by a dude
living in a van down by the river. I guess maybe in the days of public
access TV, these guys would get time or maybe on the weird local cable
show. The internet makes it easy for these people to reach a wide
audience. It probably encourages other nuts to start proselytizing,
because the barrier of entry is low and they can easily gain an
audience.

According to the “About Us” page:

> The NaturalNews Network is a non-profit collection of public education
> websites covering topics that empower individuals to make positive
> changes in their health, environmental sensitivity, consumer choices
> and informed skepticism. The NaturalNews Network is owned and operated
> by **Truth Publishing International**, Ltd., a **Taiwan corporation**.
> It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> recognized
> as a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States, but it operates without
> a profit incentive, and its key writer, Mike Adams, receives
> absolutely no payment for his time, articles or books other than
> reimbursement for items purchased in order to conduct product reviews.
>
> The vast majority of our content is freely given away at no charge. We
> offer thousands of articles and dozens of downloadable reports and
> guides (like the [Honest Food Guide](http://www.HonestFoodGuide.org))

> communities so that they may experience improved health, awareness and
> life fulfillment.

I’m sure the proprietor has good reason to base his company in Taiwan
and I’m sure it has nothing to do with tax avoidance or FDA avoidance.
The wild west of the food world is the “natural” food world. Go into a
natural food shop and you will be told all sorts of nonsense about their
products. I was once told by a clerk that drinking their mud potions
would be good for my colon. Imagine that. They were trying to have me
eat dirt. I suspect that’s the trick with all of their products. Make
sure it is harmless, like eating dirt.

Food cults are nothing new and that’s what sites like NaturalNews
exploit. The ancient Greeks had all sorts of food related rituals and
beliefs and they passed them onto the Romans. I think Pythagoras was a
vegan. The key element in all food cults is a low grade malevolence
toward humanity. If man created or improved on it, it is ruled out of
bounds by the cult. Organic food, which is often just a label, is a good
example. People think those ten dollar bananas are better because the
farmer eschews modern science.

Then there is the moral component. The point of joining a cult is to
upgrade the identity of the cult member. The adherent trades their
identity for that of the group because they think that’s better. Whole
Foods shoppers are “saving the earth”, “leaving small foot prints” and
otherwise being “socially conscious.” That’s why those grimy canvas
sacks are so popular. They display the holder’s goodness. Vegetarians
are the worst at this. They make sure to tell you they are a vegetarian
within five minutes of meeting them.
