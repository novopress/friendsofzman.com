Something I did not discuss in the show, but it will be a topic going
forward, is the candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. It may be the greatest
example of history repeating itself, but with a wry smile, we will ever
see. Most people will think of his father’s run in 1968, but it more
closely matches his uncle’s run in 1980. Ted Kennedy decided to
challenge Carter because Carter was weak.

Many have noted the parallels between this age and the 1970’s. Trump is
a good analog for Nixon. Biden is Carter. We have stagflation due to
mismanagement of the money supply and reckless spending. The politicians
have thrown open the jails and stopped prosecuting criminals, so the
cities are falling into chaos. We now even have a standoff with the
Russians. It is like old times.

Of course, the irony is that the people in charge today were in the
streets causing trouble back in the 1970’s. It is as if their last
hurrah is going to be reliving their youth at your expense, one last
time. The grand finale will be a Kennedy challenging their Jimmy Carter,
thus ushering in the end of the madness. Or will it be a Sirhan Sirhan,
this time in drag, assassinating a Kennedy to kick-off the madness?

All of those things are superficial, but the parallels are interesting.
A more serious storyline is that the Democrats may now have a Trump of
their own. Kennedy is promising to run as a populist. Many of his big
issues are popular with the sort of people who will vote for Trump in
2024. He will also tickle the fancy of old white people who still make
up a big part of the Democratic base.

If the party was willing to nuke Bernie Sanders for Hillary Clinton and
do so again for Joe Biden, they will probably do the same to Kennedy.
This time they have full control of all the regime tools. On the other
hand, Kennedy is making that a point of his candidacy, so it promises to
be a very ugly fight. It will take a heart of stone not to enjoy the
havoc Kennedy will cause in the 2024 election.
