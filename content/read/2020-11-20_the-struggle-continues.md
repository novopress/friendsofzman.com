In the business world, a regular topic of conversation is the
cost-benefit analysis to solving business problems. It is easy to see
that you don’t solve a fifty dollar problem with a million dollar
solution, but most problems are not so simple. Figuring out the real
cost of the problem is not so easy and then imagining the solution adds
a whole new layer of complexity. One of the ironies of problem solving
is figuring out the cause of the problem can cost more than the problem
itself.

Watching the election shenanigans roll on, it seems that the ruling
class may have created an expensive problem while trying to solve the
Trump problem. The wholesale election fraud has created a very expensive
problem for them. They cannot sit back and let Trump’s lawyers find
examples of fraud or use those examples to overturn one of the disputed
states, as that creates a big problem for them. Joe Biden becomes the
Pretender Biden for most of the country.

On the other hand, the only way to prevent any of this is to double down
on the shenanigans in all of these states. That means threatening
judges, lawyers and election officials. It means more midnight capers to
alter the rules and results. In other words, the way to prevent Trump
from establishing his claims is to prove another set of claims. They
will convince a large number of people that the whole system is rigged
and controlled by thugs and crooks.

This is a managerial class feature. A group of experts identify a
problem, real or imagined, then set about solving it. In the process,
they create a whole new set of problems that require a new set of
experts to solve. That new set of experts are conveniently the proteges
of the first set of experts. This cycle has rolled through the culture
since the middle of the last century. It now appears to be consuming the
system that makes the managerial class possible.

It is remarkable, when you think back over the last five years. They
could have easily co-opted Trump, by cutting some deals with him. He
would have put the MAGA stamp of approval on things like DACA, higher
immigration levels and big new administrative initiatives, in exchange
for some trinkets like the wall project. Instead, they cut off their
nose to spite their face. It is insane and suggests that maybe they are
the victims of the same process that has consumed the Trump movement.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
