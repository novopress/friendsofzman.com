------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the last several years, a group of academics and intellectuals have
formed what is now called post-liberalism. The members of this group do
not agree on many things, but they agree on one important thing and that
is what they call liberalism has run its course and it is time for
something new. Patrick Deneen, one of the key members of the
post-liberals, has a new <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Regime-Change-Toward-Postliberal-Future/dp/0593086902"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> out called *Regime Change:
Toward a Postliberal Future*, in which he sets out to describe what
should replace liberalism.

This is the third book from Deneen on the subject. In 2016, Deneen
published *Conserving America?*, which was a collection of essays on the
current social and moral troubles of this age. After that he published
*Why Liberalism Failed*, which was a book length analysis of what he
calls liberalism. This latest book is supposed to build on that second
book and lay out a vision for how to put an end to the liberal order and
provide a sketch for what should replace it.

*Regime Change* has been met with mostly negative reviews. A good <a
href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2023/06/22/regime-change-toward-a-postliberal-future-patrick-deneen/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a> is from Charles Haywood at
Worthy House, who was enthusiastically positive about Deneen’s prior
book on the subject. It is also fair to say that Haywood is positively
disposed to the broad concept of post-liberalism. He makes the point
that despite the title, Deneen is not actually suggesting we change the
regime. Instead, he offers up the usual list of reforms that have no
chance of being considered.

The main problem with the book, as Haywood notes, is that it is
organized in such a way as to avoid the main topic of the book. The
first three quarters are a summary of the arguments Deneen made in his
liberalism book. Instead of leading to a demand for a bloody revolution
to overthrow the regime, replacing it with a dictatorship of recent
Catholic converts, Deneen delivers a poorly conceived list of reforms
and some bromides about racism and colonialism.

This gets to one of the main problems with the post-liberal project. It
is not really post-liberal and the members are not opposed to
liberalism. Instead, they oppose some of the consequences of the current
ruling order. They appropriate words and concepts from dissidents,
without fully understanding the meaning of them. The phrase “regime
change” is a good example. One gets the sense that Deneen liked the
sound of it and wrote a book so he could use it for a title.

More troubling, the post-liberals have not thought about why the arc of
the liberal project has led to the present. If they wished to limit the
scope, they could start with the American constitution and examine what
happened along the way. It should be quite clear that the current ruling
order is nothing like what the Framers created and nothing they imagined
was possible. Chronicling how we got to this point, skipping past the
speculation as to why it happened, would be a good start.

There is none of that in this book or in Deneen’s prior work. In fact,
it is not particularly clear that he understands where to place the
starting point of liberalism. He gives us far too many references to
Aristotle, which is always a sign that the author is struggling with his
choice of topics. He also likes to quote Aquinas. That is getting
warmer, but when he talks about Locke, you wonder if he is talking about
the same John Locke that the rest of us had to read in college.

Probably the most puzzling thing about the Deneen project is that he
never mentions Alasdair MacIntyre, who was a long serving scholar at
Notre Dame. He wrote the book, *After Virtue*, which was a highly
successful critique of liberalism. If you search the name in Deneen’s
last two books you get zero mentions. This is strange, since MacIntyre
tackles the causes of liberalism’s failure and also takes on John Rawls,
the most important liberal political thinker of the last century.

This gets to the main problem of the post-liberal project. They do a
respectable job describing the present and the dangers it presents.
Where they struggle is in understanding that maybe the current order is
not actually a liberal order, but a post-liberal order. Further, they do
not understand that the American project evolved outside of European
liberalism. The Enlightenment is a good starting point, but the
Reformation is a much better place to start.

All that said, none of this should be taken as a dismissal of the
post-liberal project or the academics and intellectuals attracted to it.
What Deneen and others are doing is drawing attention to the inherent
flaws of the current order and in the process legitimizing the
questioning of it. Slowly, questioning the assumptions of liberalism is
becoming acceptable. When a bigfoot college academic calls for regime
change, it is now acceptable to discuss the topic in polite company.

As far as the Deneen book, while it fails to deliver on the promise of
the title, it is a useful look inside the mind of the post-liberal. The
dissident will see the same struggle they experienced as they crossed
the great divide. What comes through in this book is a man struggling to
wake up from the myth of the 20th century. If members of the modern
monastery are experiencing this, then it suggests the regime is far
closer to a moral crisis than many would like to admit.
