Fifty years ago, people just accepted the fact that there were people
walking around with nutty ideas in their head. You could easily avoid
them, and you could trust that the “marketplace of ideas” would police
the problem. Most people would recognize that this guy is a nut and
ignore him. The small number of people who fell for things like
conspiracy theories or libertarianism was small.

That is no longer true. It seems that the “marketplace of ideas” has
been flooded with crackpots, many of them sporting credentials.
Everywhere you go you feel the need to be on guard against the loonies
ululating about the latest thing. In social settings everyone has to
look over their shoulder before speaking, for fear that stating obvious
truths will set of a firestorm of mental illness.

Of course, much of this is due to the digital age. It is much easier for
the crazies to find you and inflict their craziness on you. The Gaia
worshippers, who have always existed in one form or another, are
everywhere now. Even mundane things give them a reason to start hooting
about Gaia. There is no escaping the misinformed and the deranged
because they have flooded the digital zone.

It is an interesting dilemma. The managerial elite is not wrong to worry
about the tsunami of nonsense that has swept society. You cannot have
any sort of self-governance when most people are misinformed. It is not
even clear you can have an authoritarian society when most people are
misinformed. How can you organize society when most people believe in
nonsense?

A lament among people on this side of the great divide is that Western
societies have become atomized and deracinated. That would be preferable
to a world of misinformed people networked to the rest of us via
technology. Imagine if the Gaia worshippers all suddenly lost their
internet connection for a year. The world would suddenly become quieter
and vastly more sober minded.

It is not just people who are sincerely misinformed. Spend time on
social media and it quickly becomes obvious that there are people who
take some pleasure in minting false information and passing it onto
others. In an age when information is king, these people should probably
be killed. They are the coin clippers of the digital age and should be
treated as such. Death to the misinformers!

Of course, that would require a ruling class that is not chock full of
misinformed and deranged people, which is obviously not the case. In
fact, they may be the most deranged of all. Their efforts to combat
“misinformation and disinformation” are only lowering trust in all
information. What is needed is an informed will to power that will
replace the ruling class with an informed one.
