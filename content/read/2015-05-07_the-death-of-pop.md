rel="noopener" target="_blank">One of moonbat friends sent this to me
today.</a> Being a moonbat, he stopped at the nice graph that he most
likely did not understand. What he cared about was the headline. As a
moonbat, he worships black people (from a great distance, of course) and
he naturally assumes non-moonbats are racists who hate black people.
That’s why he sent it to me. He thought it would bother me that hip-hop
the most important thing since pockets.

Being a normal, I already assumed that pop music was mostly black. Every
day of my life I hear heavy base coming from a crapbox, driven by a
white kid or an Asian. Rock music largely died out when black people
stopped playing instruments in the 1970’s. Hip-hop went mainstream in
the late seventies with The Sugarhill Gang. You can count on one hand
the number of black guys playing instruments in rock bands since then.

Anyway, not being a moonbat I looked at that story about the evolution
of pop music and wondered what that has meant for sales. A little
looking and I found this graph:

Interestingly, music sales started to fall off once hip-hop broke
through to the mainstream. It continued to slide until CD’s got everyone
to re-buy their music collections. The higher quality medium probably
drove sales too. I know the first time I heard a CD (U2) I was stunned
by the quality and immediately went out and bought a bunch of them.

Music companies were smart enough to know this was a great way to
re-sell their catalogs, which they did. All of the big bands from the
60’s and 70’s not only released their old stuff, they released stuff
that had not made the cut the first time. After a decade it started to
fall apart as people learned how to rip mp3’s and pass them around to
friends and strangers on-line.

Once you net out the boost from digitizing and repackaging music from
the 60’s and 70’s, hip-hop has been a disaster for the pop music
business. Demographics has something to do with it, but you cannot get
around the fact that sales are at all-time lows, despite the country
having more than a third more people. There’s a lesson in those numbers
that extends beyond the music business.

Something similar happened with the NBA after the Jordan years. Thinking
the key to prosperity was to embrace the hip-hop culture, the league
encouraged the players to go full gangster rap. The result was a
cratering of their TV audience, two labor stoppages and a decline in
revenue from which they have yet to recover. Maybe it was just a
coincidence, maybe not, but the sport still has an image problem.
