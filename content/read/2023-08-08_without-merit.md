Every human civilization has some mechanism to find talented people who
can be of service to the ruling class of the society. The system can be
formal, like the Chinese exam system or graduate school in modern
America. It can also be informal, as it was in the Middle Ages when a
talented young man could be noticed by his lord and given a chance to
raise his own status. The Hundred Years War created fortunes for many
common men who fought on behalf of their king.

This search for talent is not only internal. Jews in Europe found that
there was always a noble in need of smart and literate men. The
*Hoffaktor* in Germany was almost always a Jewish banker who not only
kept the finances of the house he served, but he also maintained
connections with other court factors. In return for these services,
these Jewish men were often awarded lands and titles. The endless search
for talent by the ruling elites is why we have Ashkenazi Jews.

This is important to keep in mind when members of the chattering class
talk about the meritocracy and the role it plays in the current crisis.
This <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">column</a> by David Brooks titled, “What
if We’re the Bad Guys Here?” is a good example. Brooks speaks as a
member of the meritocracy, which he defines as the highly educated and
highly connected urban class that runs the institutions. His column is
mostly a self-congratulatory call to action to address the growing
unrest.

The place to start is the assumption on behalf of Brooks and no doubt
his intended readership that he is a member of the meritocracy. He ticks
many of the boxes he repeatedly insists are requirements of the
meritocracy. He is the child of wealthy foreigners, and he went to the
right schools. He has avoided anything that looks like productive labor.
He has no loyalty to his host country. He sent his son off to serve in
the army of a foreign country.

By the standards of the people who throw around the term “meritocracy”
as a compliment, David Brooks is a good example. The question is what
service is he rendering to the ruling class? He has no useful skills,
and he has never tried to do anything that requires sacrifice on behalf
of the ruling class. His career looks like the life of a self-indulgent
fop from the British literature. What has David Brooks ever done to
merit consideration of the ruling class?

The first clue is a quote from Thomas Edsall he uses in his post to
explain why he and his fellow meritocrats aligned against Trump.
“Republicans see a world changing around them uncomfortably fast, and
they want it to slow down, maybe even take a step backward. But if you
are a person of color, a woman who values gender equality or an L.G.B.T.
person, would you want to go back to 1963? I doubt it.” That right there
captures the Cloud People – Dirt People divide.

Opposing Trump was never about practical things like the priorities of
government or the general welfare of the people. It was class struggle.
The meritocratic class view their membership in that class as a sign of
their moral goodness. Their ability to worm their way through the
labyrinth of credentialling mechanisms in order to fill up their resume
with the best associations is proof of their virtue. A perch at the New
York Times is no different from an assigned seat in the front pews.

Hatred of Trump, and it was real hate, was a defense of the *optimates*
versus the *populares* on purely class grounds. The problem is the
*optimates* are a polite fiction, a fig leaf for the tiny ruling elite
at the top of the system. The role of thoroughly impractical men like
David Brooks is to maintain both a moral code that benefits the ruling
elite and to provide a barrier between the *optimates* and the
*populares.* Trump crossing that barrier was viewed as a violation of
this system’s integrity.

That is the heart of the Brooks post. The headline is misleading as at
no point does he genuinely suggest the meritocrats are the bad guys.
Instead, he explains how people could possibly make this mistake,
because their highly exclusionary systems do seem to violate their
alleged moral code. Note he quickly moves along to the part his readers
expect from a Brooks column. That is the part where he says the Dirt
People are undereducated rubes who need to be put in their place.

In fairness, he probably sensed this and finished with “We can condemn
the Trumpian populists until the cows come home, but the real question
is: When will we stop behaving in ways that make Trumpism inevitable?”
Fools grabbed onto this thinking it revealed some genuine
self-reflection and perhaps a sign that the managerial elite is coming
around to the criticisms leveled at them. In reality, it was another
blow on the shofar to rally the people of the meritocracy.

That is how the Cloud People view things. Like the children of Israel
camping in the wilderness of Sinai, they await the final instructions.
They have seen the destruction of the Dirt People and they can see the
ultimate end of their leader. What comes soon is the Promised Land where
the meritocrats will build a kingdom of priests and a holy nation that
serves the gods of the new religion. The Dirt People will be gone and
what will remain is the righteous led by the meritocrats.

That is the purpose of these men of the meritocracy. Their role is to
keep the dream alive and encourage the elites to push forward and
faster. Whether any of this is possible is never considered. Those
debates are left to the Dirt People and once they are gone, all doubt
will be gone. In the end, the meritocracy is nothing more than a
cheering section for a system that serves elite interests at the expense
of the people and nations on which they feed.
