Way back in the early days of the internet, those already on-line could
not help but notice that the media was hilariously ignorant, but
supremely confident, of this revolutionary new thing called the
internet. On television, the people who claimed it was their job to keep
the rest of us informed clearly knew nothing about this new “internet
thing” or the people signing up for accounts. The print side of the
media barely knew the internet existed and had no interest in it at all.

In those early days it was a glimpse into the weird combination of
ignorance, insulation and confidence that defined the mass media.
Television and radio are pure carnival acts, selecting for people who
fit a role. The print side, the people engaged in “serious journalism”,
are stenographers and cheerleaders, hoping to one day be noticed by the
carnival operators so they can get on television. The whole thing is
part of a large scale agitation campaign on behalf of the ruling class.

This is what makes the collapse of Twitter so amusing. The agitation
machine that is the modern mass media was invited onto Twitter in the
early days as a way to promote the product over the alternatives.
Twitter was custom built for the slow-witted, but supremely confident
people who make up mass media. All they needed to do is download an app,
open it up and begin typing. Limiting it to short messages reduced the
odds of them exposing their stupidity.

It did not take long before the mouth breathers of the Left followed the
media onto the platform and it became an echo chamber. Of course, it did
not take long before the enemies of this unholy alliance of the
confidently stupid joined Twitter to mock and ridicule these people. For
a short while it was amusing to see someone, probably posting from the
john, wrecking the day of sanctimonious simpletons like David French or
Max Boot, with mockery and irreverence.

Of course, that is why the whole thing was doomed. The agitation machine
we call the media can only exist when the people inside of it are sure
they are the intellectual vanguard, the cutting edge of history. That
only works when they are not exposed to reality, which is what happened
when they went on-line. It has been forgotten but the great censorship
campaign began in the comment sections first and then spread to the rest
of the internet. Twitter was late to the intolerance party.

Now the party is over. Contrary to the pained howling by conspiracy
theorists like ADL leader Jonathan Greenblatt, Elon Musk did not buy
Twitter as part of some five cushion bank shot plan to bring back you
know who. Musk bought the company because he thinks you can have a
successful platform that allows open debate with limited moderation.
Elon Musk is a civic nationalist who still believes all the old liberal
ideals about the marketplace of ideas.

Of course, we live in a post liberal age. The people with real power no
longer hold those old liberal ideals. They see themselves as guardians
of humanity who must carefully manage the choices of the people. They
are the elite of the managerial system and as the elite, their job is
not only to set the direction for humanity, but to make sure the rules
are properly enforced. All of their chanting about democracy aside,
theirs is a totalitarian dictatorship of the managerial elite.

This is why Musk’s project is doomed. For starters, the agitation
machine known as the media cannot exist on a platform which allows
criticism of the media. That risks holding a mirror up to them. The
dimwitted scolds that follow them around demanding censorship of
imaginary things like hate speech cannot exist on a platform that does
not provide them protection. This is why they avoid Gab. If they start
demanding censorship there, the response is mockery.

This why the media are threatening to
<a href="https://archive.ph/Dcc0t" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stomp
off</a> in a huff to the Mastodon, the federated system of independently
created nodes. Because they are stupid and do not know how anything
works, they think that there is a trust and safety team there waiting
for them to arrive from Twitter. These people are so insulated they just
assume the internet works by magic, rather than people. Just wait until
they learn that Gab is a node on the Mastodon system. That will be a fun
day.

The bigger problem for the Musk project is that the people with real
power, like the duopoly that controls the mobile device market, will
make sure he is never able to create his civic nationalist paradise.
Apple is preparing to <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11453435/Apples-App-Store-head-leaves-Twitter-Elon-Musks-platform-clash-Google-Apple.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">remove Twitter</a> from the Apple
ecosystem and you can be sure Google is doing the same. After all, both
companies work closely to prevent competition. They have long ago worked
out how to cooperate on censorship issues.

Then there are the advertisers and purchasers of Twitter data. The main
source of revenue for Twitter and all internet firms is the sale of user
data. They sell this in packages to companies, market researchers,
political campaigns and the many intelligence services tracking our
moves. All of the people running these outfits strongly believe in the
dictatorship of the managerial elite. They see the Musk project as a
direct challenge to the system, so they will oppose it.

Even if Musk was not walking headlong into the civilizational abattoir
known as managerialism, large scale social media was always doomed. The
reason is people self-segregate and they do this because they do not
enjoy conflict. It is only the spiteful mutants who enjoy constant
turmoil. The other 80% of humanity just want to talk about their stuff
with other likeminded people. This is why all previous large scale
social media projects eventually
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=6646" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">disaggregated</a>.

While the whole thing is amusing, it should also serve as a reminder to
dissidents that this abomination we call modernity is unnatural.
Projects like Twitter that were supposed to control the culture run
counter to human nature. Mother Nature is undefeated in this area, which
is why the graveyard of intellectual thought is littered with the ideas
that challenged human nature. Musk will fail for the same reason the
ghouls before him failed with Twitter. It runs contrary to our nature.
