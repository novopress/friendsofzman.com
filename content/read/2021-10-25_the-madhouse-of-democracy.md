**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/surviving-the-modern-age/"

relate to the theme of this post, bit from the perspective of the mass
media. For those supporting the efforts here, there is a new

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the middle of the last century until the current age, the choice
presented to Americans is the party of more central government versus
the party of less central government. State and local government tends
to be left out of the discussion, as there is no money in debating it.
Regardless, even local elections tend to revolve around the central
question of how much government. Team Blue is more, and Team Red is less
or not quite as much.

This is one of the central contradictions of liberal democracy. The
claim is that democratic systems are inclusive, which means all members
of society are able to participate in the process. The political
theorist [Robert Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dahl) listed
inclusiveness as one of his prerequisites of democracy. Not only are all
people included in the process, but all ideas are given a chance to
reach the public square. A requirement of democracy is that all ideas
are fully heard and fully considered.

The composition of the two parties in America, Team Red and Team Blue,
makes it clear that the choices are narrow and exclusive. Despite the
fact that both parties preach about the need to get everyone involved,
both work to make sure the choices on offer never change. You can have
more involvement by the central government in your life or you can have
less of it. Put another way, you can have more of what you don’t want,
or you can have less of what you need.

A good example is in this American Thinker
[piece](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2021/10/61_of_americans_paid_no_federal_income_taxes_in_2020_whos_greedy_.html)
on taxes. The site is fairly representative of Team Red. The claim of
the post is that two thirds of Americans paid no federal income taxes.
The source is a government sponsored think tank called Tax Policy
Center, which publishes this sort of stuff every year. They play the
role of Team Red, demanding lower tax rates for rich people. The post
concludes that the 60% not paying taxes are being mean to the nation’s
rich people.

Interestingly, this sort of rhetoric is not aimed at rich people but
aimed at the middle and working class. Rich people are not reading the
American Thinker or any of these sites from Conservative Inc. The
closest they come is the upper-middle-class person who imagines himself
as rich. Otherwise, these sites cater to the people who take orders in
exchange for a salary. Many of whom are in that two-thirds the author
thinks are selfish jerks for not paying taxes.

Of course, there is another side to this. The mass media is full of
opinion writers who make mid-six-figure salaries. Their audience is
often the middling members of the managerial class who make similar
salaries. The demand here is for the rich to pay their fair share of
income taxes, despite the fact that the genuinely rich make their money
from things other than salary. In other words, in the name of fairness,
the servants of the rich need to pay more tax.

The paradox of modern liberal democracy is that despite its constant
exhortations in favor of inclusion, it systematically excludes most
options. It is a tails the rich people win or heads the rest of the
people lose. There is no option for the guy making $250K per year to get
more of what he wants from government at a better rate. The people not
paying income tax do not have an option that promises to do some of
things they want at a reasonable cost in taxes to them.

The fact is, most of the people who vote Republican want the government
to defend cultural norms so they can live their lives in peace. They
don’t mind paying taxes and they do not resent rich people for being
rich. The people voting Democrat want the government to do a better job
looking after the poor and to provide useful services to the
middle-class. The people running both parties hate all of that and spend
their time pitting the two sides against one another.

That American Thinker post is a good example of how it is done. The
claim itself is implausible, which is why the sourcing is so convoluted.
Even dishwashers pay some income taxes, so how are two-thirds of
households managing to pay their bills if they have no taxable income?
The devil lies in the definitions, but the people who churn this stuff
out know that no one digs into the details. Instead, it is fed to Team
Red with an executive summary they can use in their posts.

In other words, the point of the exercise is to maintain the false
choice between the two factions in politics. One side promises that you
will get more of what you do not want from government and the other side
promises to make sure the government never does any of the things you
want from government. Both sides invest a lot of time telling you the
other side is to blame for this. Democracy is a false choice in which
both sides blame the other for outcomes neither side wanted.

This is why there is <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">no correlation</a> between voting
patterns, public opinion, and the final policy results. The more you
participate within the parameters of the system, the less you get of the
things you want from the system. With each election, this paradox
becomes more evident. Voter participation goes up, while voter
frustration with the results goes up as well. This illusion of choice
logically must lead to some untenable point where the frustration
exceeds the capacity of the system.

One of the implications of Robert Dahl’s thinking was that democracy was
impossible in a society of any size. Instead, he proposed that what we
get from popular government is something he called polyarchy, “a form of
government in which power is invested in multiple people”. The state
follows certain procedures in order to maintain “the continuing
responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens,
considered as political equals”.

Clearly, modern liberal democracy is not responsive to the preferences
of the citizens and the people at the top do not see the citizens as
equals. Not only is the system not democratic by definition, it is not
even the compromise imagined by Dahl. In other words, the real
contradiction of liberal democracy is that in its full flowering it is
neither liberal nor democratic. It is a collection of false choices and
deceptions to mask the realty of a ruling elite impervious to the
popular will.

The great irony of liberal democratic politics is that to make it more
democratic, more responsive to the will of the people, means abandoning
the system entirely. This leads to another contradiction in that the
people in it, knowing the choices are not what they desire, insist on
picking from the options presented, thinking this will change the
options at some future date. Liberal democracy is a madhouse of
contradictions that slowly drives the victims of it insane.
