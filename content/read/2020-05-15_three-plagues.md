The original plan for the show this week was to talk about the fact that
many people seem to be enjoying the panic over the virus. This is a
wide-ranging phenomenon that includes people on this side of the great
divide. [Greg Johnson](https://twitter.com/NewRightAmerica), for
example, thinks the lock downs should continue until forever. Presumably
he knows immortality is not in the cards, so he is happy to keep the
lock downs in place forever. He’s in good company, as lots of people
seem to agree with him and want this to continue.

The lock down camp is not monolithic. Some people are simply enjoying
the new lifestyle that has arisen in the last two months. Working at
home, home schooling and the simple life has been a revelation to many
people. One thing that has been revealed in all of this is that many
Americans detest the office life. They hate it with the intensity of a
thousand suns. If it means playing along with the virus charade in order
to avoid going back to the cubicle farm, they are happy to do it.

There’s also a wing that is genuinely frightened. Here in Lagos, there
is a couple that has not been outside since the local tyrant issued the
lock down order. They have groceries delivered to them. There have been
other deliveries, presumably other supplies they would normally buy at a
store. The delivery people leave the items on the porch and when he has
retreated to safety, they retrieve the items. Otherwise, they have not
been outside in over six weeks now.

Of course, the fear is spread through the media. Something I’ve noticed
about the people in the fear camp is they tend to be very left-wing. The
couple in hiding are Bernie Bro types. Others are deep into the
anti-Trump stuff. This makes some sense as left-wing people tend to be
intensely on-line and very trusting of the media. They also have a faith
in government that defies reason. They are sure all corporations are
evil, but they have a child-like faith in the government.

This is something that normal people are picking up now. Much of what is
driving the panic is the anti-Trump lunacy. We forget that these same
people were sure that Trump was going to declare himself dictator. They
are still sure he is secretly plotting with Boris and Natasha to
“undermine our democracy!” Maybe they think the virus is part of the
secret plot or some form of divine retribution, but they have conflated
their response to Trump with their reaction to the virus.

On this side of the great divide, there is a wing that is driven by
their reaction to the people demanding the economy open up. Like all
reactionaries, they allow their enemies do all the thinking. If Paul
Ramsey is in favor of something, these people will oppose it without
giving it much thought. They better hope he does not do a video opposing
suicide anytime soon. That is the cost of a negative identity. You put a
leash around your neck and hand the other end to those you hate.

Right now, at least, the sum of these various tribes is a majority. Here
in Lagos, the local tyrant will end the lock down this weekend. There
will be plenty of restrictions, but business can begin to open again.
The city and county officials, however, are fighting him and will issue
their own orders to continue the lock down. Presumably they are doing
this because they think it is popular. For now, at least, most people
want to keep the pandemic charade going for the rest of the month.

That’s another element to this. Most people really do think the people
in charge will figure out how to pay their bills and keep the food
supply going. It really is just a live action role play for them. This
is not everyone and maybe no longer a majority, but at some point,
reality is going to return to the scene. You cannot shut down the
economy like this without real consequences. How will the lock down fans
respond when they are suddenly faced with the reality of this thing?

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
