In case anyone thought the muzzling of dissent was a Continental
problem, <a
href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/online-troll-muslims-police-facebook-11707461#ICID=sharebar_twitter"
target="_blank">here’s a story from Britain</a> that is worse than the
German story.

> An online troll ended up in the dock after posting comments ‘grossly
> offensive’ to Muslims on a police website.
>
> Dad-of-seven Stephen Bennett, 39, made inflammatory remarks on Greater
> Manchester Police’s Facebook page, in response to an appeal for
> information in a sex case with an Asian suspect.

I’ll just note that the internet term “troll” has now been redefined to
mean “people who refuse to shut up.” It used to mean “someone trolling
for attention.” Now the Progs have defined it to be “the scary little
man shouting hate think at the bridge to paradise.”

> One comment he made concerned Asian women, another was likely to be
> offensive to Muslims.
>
> Bennett, of Wythenshawe, also wrote: “Don’t come over to this country
> and treat it like your own. Britain first.”
>
> He made the comments despite his mother-in-law and sister-in-law being
> Muslims, his lawyer told the court.
>
> The response sparked outrage from Facebook users who feared his
> remarks would set people against each other.
>
> When Bennett was arrested by officers in an 8am house call, he said:
> “Is this about that Muslim thing on Facebook? I’m getting locked up
> for sticking up for my own country.”

Notice how the writer is astonished that this monster does not like
Muslims despite the fact his in-laws are Muslims. In the New Religion,
diversity is our strength so there must be something really wrong with
this guy. He’s getting a full dose of diversity at the dinner table, yet
he remains a racist! Some people are beyond repair so I hope they put
him down mercifully. Wouldn’t want his sort infecting others!

> Bennett later admitted an offence under the Malicious Communications
> Act.
>
> His Manchester Crown Court sentencing hearing was told that he was a
> dad-of-seven who was finding it ‘difficult to cope’ at the time
> because of the loss of his job, but was now back in work as a cleaner.
>
> His lawyer added that his mother-in-law and sister-in-law were
> Muslims, and that he was not racist.
>
> But web users who read his posts felt his remarks would fuel tensions.
>
> One Muslim witness told police he was concerned the ‘irresponsible’
> comments would ‘incite hatred’ and be a ‘potential tool for
> radicalisation’.
>
> Another Muslim personally offended by the remarks challenged Bennett
> online, telling him ‘act your age’.
>
> People in the wider community were also offended, prosecutor Gavin
> Howie told court, with one female Facebook user describing his remarks
> as ‘offensive to all women’.

Orwell deleted things like this from his own work as he assumed no one
would believe it, even in fiction. The suspension of disbelief can only
go so far. We used to mock primitives for carrying on like this.
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24539989" target="_blank">We
still do</a>. The accused would be charged with black magic and his
accusers would claim to have been given the whammy by the accused. The
judge would then consult the court shaman, who would read some goat
innards or his star maps and offer up an opinion.

The religious aspect of this is clear. In the New Religion, the
happiness of the dusky people is the sign of collective morality. If the
muzzies are vexed, then it must be the fault of the honkies for failing
to embrace diversity. It’s why the good thinkers take the side of cop
killers. Even through the cop is doing an important duty, the
unhappiness of the killers, the black ones, is a sign the void where God
used to be is unhappy with the people.

You’ll also note that one can be indirectly “offended” by a heretic. Why
else include in the story that one Muslim was “personally” offended? It
means one can be transitively offended, in the same way one can feel
shame for the sins of your society. The concept of “offense” has taken
on a spirit form like a jinn. How long before the theocrats demand we
affix hex signs on our homes and wear talismans to ward off the racist
jinn?
