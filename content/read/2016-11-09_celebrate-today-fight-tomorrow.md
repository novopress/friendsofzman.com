Like most everyone, the election result left me in a state of mild
euphoria for the last dozen or so hours. It’s mostly due to the fact I
stayed up half the night watching the results. I’m usually in bed by
midnight so being up past two made for a challenging day. Even so, it
feels pretty good to see the good guys win once in a while. It feels
even better when you are proved right.
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=7596" target="_blank">I put
Hillary at 46%</a> for this election and she came in a tiny bit higher,
but well below 50%. I said all along that the status quo must break 50%
to carry the night.

Now, I look forward to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zGxi-7xDDw"
target="_blank">Triumph</a>. In January, Donald Trump will enter the
Imperial Capital in a four horse chariot, wearing a laurel crown and
painted toga. Behind him, in chains and rags, will be the members of
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nevertrump16/"
target="_blank">NeverTrump</a>. The great enemy of the people and the
threat to the republic, Hillary Clinton, will be displayed in a wheeled
cage so the citizens can throw rotten vegetables at her. After the
festivals, the proscription lists will be posted around the city and the
<a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430137/donald-trump-conservative-movement-menace"
target="_blank">NeverTrump loons</a> will be thrown into a pit.

Yes, victory feels good.

That said, this is not the end. It is just the beginning and the road
from here to a safe and healthy country is long and full of perils. A
political class that is willing to tolerate festering carbuncles like
the Clintons, is perfectly willing to close ranks and do everything it
can to destroy the Trump presidency. A nation willing to vote for a
woman with the ethics of Pol Pot is a nation willing to stand aside and
let the political class stymie any attempt to reform the broken system.
Cautious pessimism is the right outlook today.

The thing Trump has working for him is that the ruling class is truly
stunned at the result of the election. This is a black swan event for
them. This is not just a media phenomenon. Kelly Ayotte is staggering
around Manchester New Hampshire with her panties on her head, asking
people if they know where she lives. She went all in on rejecting Trump
and now she is out of a job. The politicians that listened to their
party leaders and distanced themselves from Trump were all punished at
the polls. The world is upside down.

That’s what makes Trump so frightening to the political class. It’s not
that they threw everything at him and he won. That can happen. Political
athletes are skilled at beating the odds. What’s frightening about Trump
is that he is the nullification of conventional politics. He ran an old
school campaign and ran it like a business, instead of a jobs program
for the political class. He ticked none of the boxes the experts say you
must tick. He rearranged a political map everyone said could not be
changed. Trump is scary man right now.

The thing that scares the political class more than anything is that
Trump had coattails. It was an article of faith among the political
class that Trump would hurt down ballot candidates. He was a badge of
shame on the GOP, akin to slavery, and they would not recover for a
generation. Instead, Trump boosted candidates who embraced him and his
success probably saved the Senate and may have saved the
House. Everything the political class believed on Monday was proved
false on Tuesday.

One reason Trump exists and is the next president is that the political
class is long overdue for reform. The reason the political class is a
dumpster fire is the public has lost its civic morality. That cannot be
fixed with one election. That cannot be fixed by one man in one job.
What ails the country is not a missing comma in the tax code or the
regulatory code. The political culture in Washington has to change and
that happens when the American culture changes.

Another reason Trump is the next president is a lot of people were
willing to say what is not supposed to be said. Good men have sacrificed
much in an effort to stem the cultural slide.

right in an age when being right can often be dangerous. There’s also
the social media trouble makers like

maybe giving women the vote was not such a great idea. Sign up for a

truth in a world where speaking truth is a revolutionary act. Be a man
with nothing to lose.

Celebrate now. Tomorrow we go back to the war.
