“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and
creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast
carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other
people clean up the mess they had made.”

–The Great Gatsby

While writing yesterday’s tirade about the conservative industrial
complex and their poverty pimps, I kept thinking about the weirdness of
the people who populate the upper reaches of the conservative think tank
rackets. They obviously make enormous amounts of money doing very
little, which is not the world of most Americans. They don’t keep
regular hours at work, coming and going as they see fit. They live in
communities that are set apart from the rest of America. They have
little interaction with normal people.

None of this is new. Normal people learn quickly that the rich are not
like the rest of us, despite the Hemingway quip to the contrary. The
lack of want changes a man. Struggle, fear and the sleepless nights are
the crucible of resourcefulness and creativity. The result is not
just resourcefulness, but caution and prudence. It is the instinctive
understanding of risk that comes from failure, what economists call
moral hazard¹, that is at the heart of prudence. Pamper a man long
enough and he loses this.

It is most obvious with our carny folk. Young people go into the circus
hoping to become stars, but most spend their youth waiting tables, doing
odd jobs and never doing more than some small parts in small
productions. Some kick around as extras, making a decent living, but
working hard. These are usually very sensible people because they know
how hard it is to maintain their spot and they appreciate how quickly it
can go away. It’s not an accident that these are the most right-wing
people in Hollywood.

Then we have the stars who are magically plucked from the gutter and
made rich, glamorous and famous. It’s rare for a mega star to have had a
long apprenticeship or have struggled in bit parts for a long time. They
tend to hit it big early in their career. Whatever sense they had is
quickly squeezed out of them and they become spoiled toddlers,
complaining about the unfairness of the world.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Meryl Streep</a> is a classic
example. She hit the acting lottery and now lectures the peons about our
lack of morality.

Now, Streep was probably nuts before she entered the carnival, but it
does not take long for someone living like a noble to start thinking
they are noble. If serendipity led you to a one-percent lifestyle, you
can be forgiven for thinking that you were chosen. Further, you can be
forgiven for thinking that things like hard work, prudence and
loyalty are a sucker’s game. After all, the people who cherish those
things live down in the valley, while you live up on the hill with the
rest of the Cloud People.

This seems to be the dynamic in the managerial elite. They went off to
college, ticked the right boxes and were magically transported to the
top of society. Look through the biographies of famous pundits, media
people and public intellectuals and you don’t find a lot of time in the
fields with the sons of toil. Instead, you see biographies like the
<a href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/macron-the-outsider/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soon-to-be-president of
France</a>. Macron was literally plucked from the crowd, like Billy Ray
Valentine from <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Trading_Places"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trading Places</a>. Why would
Macron value hard work and struggle?

The consequence free world of the ruling classes not only makes them
reckless; it makes them contemptuous of the lower ranks, particularly
the middle class. It’s probably why the American Left adopted the
anti-bourgeoisie language of Continental Marxists, despite living
exaggerated versions of the bourgeoisie lifestyle. It just felt good.
That appears to have been the motivation of those who sponsored Barak
Obama’s political career in Chicago. The aging radicals who sponsored
him knew he would offend normal people.

This witch’s brew of reckless disregard and seething contempt is on
display in this story about <a

I don’t know about the Arab and Mexican stuff, but I do know the reason
he went from rent boy to political rock star is that he is “not American
enough.” If he was an Irish guy named O’Shea, he would be working the
business end of a shovel, rather than entertaining the Cloud People.
Like an actor waiting tables, this guy’s whole existence is about
cultivating a look in the hope of catching the attention of the right
people. He may as well be an actor, as he is just playing a character he
thinks will be in demand in the big show.

Read the rest of the article and it is clear that
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammarnajjar"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ammar is as dumb as a
hamster</a>. He’s just repeating phrases he has picked up as an extra in
his minor gigs in Washington. But, he has the look in demand with the
Cloud People and he is about as alien to the native stock as you’re
going to get, so he has a future in Progressive politics. It’s not hard
to imagine a Prog version of Tom and Daisy Buchanan backing this clown’s
political career because it let’s them piss on the little people, who
they detest so much.

¹The term “Moral Hazard” has become a safe word for innumerate
fetishists, who will be tempted to sperg on it. Save it. I’m not
interested.
