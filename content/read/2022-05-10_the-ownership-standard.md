It is fair to say that ownership is a prerequisite for human society.
The ability to own things and have ownership respected by the other
members of society is what allows for settled society to form. The
evidence we have says that hunter-gatherers understood the concept of
property and property rights. People in these groups owned thing and
that ownership was respected. Early settled societies formed around the
claim of ownership of necessary resources like hunting land.

In theory collective ownership is possible, but the one big experiment
with it in the last century was a disaster. The theory was that once
private property was eliminated, inequality and conflict would be
eliminated. Yet within communist societies, there were laws against
theft, thus tacitly acknowledging ownership. It also underscored the
fact that conflict was not purely economic. Most crime is caused by an
immutable fact of the human condition. Some people are born bad.

Not only does it turn out that private property and property rights are
prerequisites for human society, but they are also a good measure of
societal development. By the time the Europeans were ready to conquer
the globe, they had worked through the problems of property ownership
and how to settle disputes. Europeans landed in Africa and the Americas,
only to greet people who had yet to master this basic concept. Even in
Asia, property ownership was still in development.

In this age, property rights are a good way to see how things are
slipping within Western societies. This <a
href="https://dnyuz.com/2022/05/06/goodwill-sold-a-bust-for-34-99-its-an-ancient-roman-relic/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> about a woman finding an
ancient artifact at a junk store is a good example. She spotted what she
thought was a strange lawn ornament that turned out to be a Roman bust
from the first century AD. Its last know whereabouts were in Bavaria,
but she found it in a Texas thrift shop. No one knows how it got to
Texas, but it was most likely a war prize.

The interesting thing about the story is the women is being forced to
give the bust back to the last known owner. Since that owner does not
exist, it will be turned over to the Bavarian government. The argument
is that the last acknowledged owner did not sell or transfer the bust.
Without proof of that or something to suggest there was a rightful owner
after the Bavarian king, the king still has rights to it. Since the king
is no more, his rights revert to the Bavarian state.

On the one hand, it seems like a good result. Respecting property
rights, even across countries and generations is a good practice. Jews
have been hunting lost property, or claims to lost property, since the
end of the war. Their argument rests on the fact that their items that
were lost in the war are still their items, as they did not voluntarily
transfer those items to the Nazis. The current owner may have honestly
acquired them, but the seller was not legally allowed to sell them.

On the surface, this looks a good example of how modern Western
societies enforce ownership rights. There is a global database of art.
Unless you can go into that database and show you are the rightful
owner, you cannot sell the item. That is why this Texas woman is being
forced to give up her Roman bust. She probably could keep it in her
garden, but she could never sell it to a collector. In other words, the
lack of provenance has rendered it worthless to her.

This heartwarming story of rich people getting their toys back, however,
is an exception, rather than the rule. This example of enforcement of
property rights is the exception in the modern West. For most people,
the phrase “you will own nothing and like it” is becoming the new
normal. Even real property rights are conditional in America, as we saw
with Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut. That
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/04-108" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">case</a> basically turned property ownership into a
privilege granted by the state.

At a more basic level, ownership is a thing of the past in America. Tech
companies are allowed to harvest your personal information without your
permission and sell it, often using it against the people from whom they
stole it. Privacy, which can only exist in the context of property
rights, has been lost. The mass media routinely violates the privacy of
people it has deemed enemies of the state. Ownership and everything that
springs from it is slowly being eroded in the current age.

Here is a simple example of how the erosion of property rights has
eroded the basic order of society. We get daily reports of computer
breeches in which the personal data of consumers is stolen by thieves.
The companies trusted with this information are never punished for their
negligence. The thieves are never caught. In fact, no one bothers to
look for them. Often the stolen property ends up in the hands of the
media or random weirdos on the internet.

The result is you lose the right to privacy and the ownership rights to
your data, with little recourse in the law. If something private about
you, your views on some political issue, get stolen from a tech platform
and posted in the media, you have no way to reassert your ownership
rights. You cannot sue the news site that posted the stolen information
and you cannot sue the site from which it was stolen. You, the victim,
have no protection while the beneficiaries of theft are protected.

A good example of this is Trump’s tax returns. During his time in
office, the New York Times came into possession of his tax returns.
These were stolen from the IRS by an employee, most likely. This person
had no right to those documents and they had no right transfer them to
the Times. The Times knew this and knew they were in receipt of stolen
goods, but they published them anyway. The standard in America is
finder’s keepers and society is the weeper.

If the Supreme Court really wanted to do some social justice, they would
forget about Roe and find a case to overturn Kelo in the context of the
reestablishment of basic property rights. Imagine if we go back to the
ancient custom that says you own you and you own what you make by
default. Most the abuses of the tech monopolies go away as their ability
to steal your property goes away. The media’s ability to use stolen
property would evaporate along with much of their power.

A simple example on that latter point is the Roe leak. The person who
received the stolen item knew it was stolen. The person who gave it to
him, unless it was Sam Alito, had no right to transfer it to the
reporter. Imagine a regime that says the reporter gets charged with
receiving stolen goods and the leaker gets charged with theft. All of a
sudden, the journalistic practice of selective leaking goes away and
they have to go back to old fashioned investigating and reporting.

Beyond that, this case of the Roman bust underscores the root cause of
societal collapse in the West. The elites care more about the chain of
custody for works of art than they care about fixing roads or making
sure the people can feel secure in the person and in their papers. For
the same reason they care more about Ukrainian borders than the Mexican
border, they care more about tracking art items than defending the basic
concepts than make society possible.

It is easier for the elites to “care” about the chain of custody for a
Roman bust than it is to care about busted roads or decaying schools. It
is easier to slap on a Ukrainian lapel pin than it is to do something
about fentanyl. The public gesture is also more fun and rewarding than
the grunt work required of elites to keep society going. Ours is a Nero
elite, people who spend their days dreaming of new ways to flatter
themselves while the basics of society crumble. They need to come to the
same end.
