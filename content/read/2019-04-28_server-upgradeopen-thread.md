Yesterday and last night, the server was upgraded to hopefully put an
end to the problems I have been having of late. Performance should be
better. There is still work to be done to finish the setup, so if the
site goes dark today, it is just maintenance. If you experience anything
weird that is related to the site, Iâ€™m not interested in your fight with
the mime at the dog park, post it up here so I can investigate.
Otherwise, things should settle down today.
