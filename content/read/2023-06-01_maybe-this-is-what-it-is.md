A popular plot device in movies is the hidden conspiracy where the main
players slowly learn about a secret group that is actually running
things. This secret group makes it look like the official systems are
running things, but in reality, they are manipulating things behind the
scenes for their own purposes. The movie *The Matrix* is basically a
conspiracy story, except that the conspirators have conjured all of
reality for humanity, who they have enslaved as batteries for some
reason.

The flaw in all of these stories is that the people behind the
conspiracy are so good that they are able to pull off the conspiracy. On
the other hand, they make basic errors that allow the good guys to
discover the conspiracy. This is done for the sake of expediency so we
can get to the showdown between the good guys and the villains. Movies
are about two hours of run time, so the filmmakers have to rush through
the discovery phase in order to have time for the final act.

What they get right though is that those little things that do not make
sense but are generally ignored by people. After all, if there is a
secret group running things, it means they are changing things in
violation of the rules. This was the basis of the Russian collusion hoax
mania. The believers in this conspiracy were sure they had stumbled onto
an event that had clearly violated the rules of the universe, thus
proving that there is someone secretly manipulating things.

This makes even more sense when you consider that the people who fell
for this conspiracy theory live in the world of narratives. Their
understanding of existence is through narrative devices created by the
likeminded. The people sure Trump was the result of a secret Russian
plot think they live in a long running movie. For them, all of reality
is just a long running story, the flow of history. The Russian collusion
hoax was proof that existence is just one long story.

As nutty as these people sound, they are right in that if we are living
in a simulation or one long story, then there is someone responsible for
it. Maybe it is just a first mover who set the story in motion or maybe
it is a computer programmer. Like *The Matrix*, our consciousness exists
in a computer simulation. Instead of something cool like Warhammer 40K,
we are stuck in a poorly drawn version of a world where child molesters
get a whole month to honor them.

The other thing about those movies that ties in with the Russian
collusion hoax and other popular conspiracy theories is that the people
who discover the truth are always the weirdos and oddballs. It takes a
person who naturally lives outside the normalcy of life to see the flaws
of the narrative. Pursuing these anomalies in the story in the face of
popular opposition requires a willingness to be unpopular. The movies
are right that the people who will discover the conspiracy will be the
oddballs.

The Russian collusion hoax was not real, but the people who were into it
were strange characters who do not get along with others. We live in an
age in which these people are selected by the people running the media,
but it does not change the fact that these people are not right in the
head. They are the same people who think their food is out to get them,
that their gas range is in a plot with the minivan to kill Gaia and that
there is an invisible Nazi army lurking in the shadows.

If you were a character in a conspiracy movie, the stuff in that
previous paragraph would be a clue that things are not as they seem.
After all, if the world operated by the rules everyone swears are in
place, it should not result in the mass media being dominated by
paranoid lunatics. Once it was clear, for example, that Rachel Maddow
was wrong about the Russian conspiracy stuff, someone would replace her
who is not suffering from these paranoid delusions.

It is not just the crazies that fall outside the rules. It is possible
that these people are selected by the media because some people like
freak shows. Most people do not like a freakshow, but some people do and
it is a lucrative audience. In other words, it makes no sense to employ
foaming at the mouth nutters in the media, but it makes sense if that
part of the media is a circus. The universe suddenly makes sense again
when you can explain these anomalies within the rules of the universe.

Of course, like the characters in a movie wrestling with the
contradictions in the narrative, the story does not end there. What
explains Jennifer Rubin? Look at her
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Rubin_(columnist)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">life story</a> and explain how that makes
any sense. Throw in the fact that she is clearly insane, and she is a
massive bug in the code. Now, there are people out there who would offer
an explanation, but that is just an alternative explanation for who
controls the simulation that is our consciousness.

Like the kooks in the circus part of the media, the “serious” part of
the media is full of examples that are not easily explained. How has a
goofy looking bugman like David French risen to a perch at the New York
Times? How has a talentless hack like Jonah Goldberg become a rich and
famous pundit? Look around at public life and little of what you see
makes sense within the rules as stated. Maybe the answer is we are
living in an increasingly bug riddled simulation.

Again, maybe there is an explanation that does not require us to
question the very nature of reality. Maybe there is a good reason we
only have two mobile phone companies or two political parties that say
the same things. Perhaps within the rules this all makes perfect sense
once the rules are explained properly. You always have to keep open the
possibility that it is not the world that is going crazy. You are the
one who is going mad, and the world is perfectly fine.

Alternatively, the madness of this age, including the popularity of
conspiracy theories and narrative hoaxes, could be in response to the
fixes in the code. As the late physicist John Barrow
<a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/barrowsim.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">explained</a>, complexity results in
error and the more complex human society gets, the more errors we
experience. Many of these fixes fall outside the rules of our reality,
so they lead some to question reality itself. The madness of this age is
the result of a cumulative bug fix some have noticed.

If we take a step back from the simulation and conspiracy stuff, maybe
the answer is simply that the incoherence of the world is due to an
incoherence in the rules that govern our world. Through some combination
of evolution, design, and serendipity, we have ended up with a set of
rules that make perfect sense in terms of outcomes, because the rules
are just as nutty as those outcomes. In other words, it is not a
conspiracy we are seeing. It is entropy.

That may also explain the increasing popularity of conspiracy theories,
especially among the primary beneficiaries of the system. It is far more
comforting to think the rules are mostly fine and it is just some secret
forces out there in the shadows responsible for the anomalies, than to
think that maybe the problem is the rules and that maybe the system is
in collapse. Most people would prefer to think they are living in a
computer simulation than face up to reality.
