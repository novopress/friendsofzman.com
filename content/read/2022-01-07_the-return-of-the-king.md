This week the Power Hour makes its triumphant return just in time to
celebrate one of the newest, but most solemn festivals, Insurrection
Day. Given the way they have been carrying on for the last year, it is
surprising that a congressional idiot has not suggested making it a
federal holiday. Then again, that would make it more difficult to
brainwash school children into thinking that this is the time when
orange Nazis tried to burn down the <s>Reichstag</s> Capitol and seize
power with Big Lies!

The absurdity of this ridiculous drama conceals something interesting
about the psychology of the political class. They seem to require an
Alamo-type event to rally their minds around as they lash out at their
enemies. Charlottesville, another trivial affair, has been a rallying
point for them. They got three years out of that one, so January 6th
will probably be with us through the next presidential election unless
some new political tragedy is engineered by our good friends at the FBI.

Part of it is the fact that the ideology of liberal democracy does not
provide the sense of struggle required to keep everyone engaged. Like
communism, liberal democracy has evolved into a revolutionary mindset
without a defined end. It is just a process that goes on until something
magical happens and we reach utopia. The commies came up with perpetual
revolution to solve this problem. Liberal democracy is evolving a
culture of permanent crisis to keep the believers engaged.

Charlottesville and now January 6 are legends that can be told around
the campfires as reminders of the struggle. They both have the same
elements. The cause was the good people were not vigilant, which allowed
the bad guys to form up. Both stories have a point where things could go
either way. Both have the point when the righteous swept the villains
from the field and triumphed over evil. Both have their martyrs,
although the January 6 martyrs are imaginary.

Of course, the more you examine it the more you see that the overlap
between ideological zeal and insanity is quite large. These people
cannot exist in the world as it is, so they have created a fantasy
world. This world of imaginary villains is one where they can pretend to
be on the side of angels in the great struggle. By itself it would be
harmless, but this madness comes with a fanatical drive to control
society. These people are crazy and highly motivated to take over
society.

Communism eventually sidelined the fanatics. That is largely what
happened when the Brezhnev faction deposed Khrushchev. The more sober
minded saw that rule by true believer would get everyone killed. They
were still left with an unworkable system full of logical
contradictions, but they were able to stabilize it for a generation. It
remains to be seen if liberal democracy can pull it off. Biden is the
closest analog to Brezhnev and he is a doddering old fool incapable of
doing anything.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
