Jonah is sorely vexed over the deliberate exclusion of the non-PPP in
the GOP field, but that misses a much better point about Progressives.
If one were to portray the power brokers of America preparing for the
election, it would be Elizabeth Warren holding a fundraiser on the
Harvard campus, attended by the glitterati of the billionaire class.

Instead, the Left maintains the fantasy that the Pale Penis People, with
their Anglo-Saxon culture and stubborn traditionalism operate out of
exclusive country clubs, while the revolutionary vanguard bangs on the
door in the name of the people. As Sailer is fond of pointing out, even
the banal image of the WASP country club is at odds with history.

It is an interesting aspect of the New Religion. Fundamental to Jewish
identity is being the outsider and the victim. Jews see themselves not
just apart, but excluded from the main. Unsaid is the fear that at any
moment the main will take note of the fringe and push it further away
from the core or worse. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made a lot
of people rich by frightening Jewish widows with stories of secret Nazis
living next door.

This otherness has become enmeshed in modern Progressive thought and
identity. Elizabeth Warren certainly started the Indian nonsense as a
way to advance her career, but she did so by advancing her status as an
outsider at the most elite training center of American power, Harvard
University. Think of that. In order to reach the top, one must pretend
to be on the bottom.

It is a strange delusion. The American Progressive imagines a world
where David always beats Goliath, but the results are always the fault
of Goliath, thus demanding a rematch so David can beat Goliath again.
The WASP ruling cast has been dead for a century, but Progressives keep
them alive so they can pick a fight with them. Since the enemy is
imaginary, they will always have them as a rallying point.

It’s why I’ve taken to calling the new religion “faculty lounge
Kabbalah.” It’s a mysticism based on the trinity of egalitarianism,
anti-racism and multiculturalism. It’s not hierarchical or dogmatic.
Instead it blends the Jewish sense of otherness and outsiderness with
the revolutionary fervor of Rousseau-ism, into a religion of perpetual
culture war. Progress is not a linear journey to a promised land. It is
a process of perpetual turmoil leading to enlightenment.
