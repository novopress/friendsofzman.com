Today is the 100th anniversary of the start of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World War I</a>. At least it
is considered the anniversary. This is the day Gavrilo Princip shot
Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie in the city of
Sarajevo. The Austrians blamed the Serbs and in July delivered an
ultimatum they surely knew would be rejected. The point was to provoke
war with the Serbs, which it did. In a month the great powers of Europe
were aligned against one another in what would be a massively brutal
war.  Close to 40 million men were killed, wounded or went missing in 51
months of war.

To put that in some perspective, the population of the United States at
the start of the war was roughly 99 million. Every hour of every day of
the war over 1,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing. Put
another way, one day’s fighting in The Great War had more military
casualties than the entire Iraq War. It is why, as John Derbyshire
points out in his <a
href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/RadioDerb/2014-06-28.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest transmission</a>, that
Europeans called it a suicide attempt.

The Great War has got slighted in the history books, but that may be
changing. Outside the Left, more people are taking a fresh look at this
war. Watching the American ruling class feverishly try to flood the
country with third world peasants in an attempt to break the back of the
middle-class, one cannot help but think things are headed to a dramatic
denouement. One hundred years ago the ruling elites of the civilized
world tried to commit suicide. They seem to be at it again.

The question that naturally arises when looking at the prelude to the
Great War is how did these people not see what was coming? As John
points out, all of the principles were highly civilized and highly
cultivated. These were not savage people led by glory seeking leaders.
The rulers of Europe were often related and certainly familiar with one
another through social connections. They were highly educated men
leading a class of men with much to lose and little to gain from war.
Yet, the actions of a lone madman set the civilized world on fire.

Similarly, no one outside the Left can figure out why our current rulers
want to destroy their countries. Pat Buchanan famously noted that we may
be the first civilization in history in which the ruling elite despises
that which holds them up as elites. The drive to bring in exotic
peasants to destroy the America is an act of suicide. The sorts of
leaders these peasants favor tend to murder the types of leaders we have
in place.

Today as 100 years ago, the causes and explanation are complicated. You
really can’t point to one thing to place the blame. Part of our trouble
today is due to the strange ideology that dominates American politics.
It is a toxic blend of Utopian lunacy and rage against the limits of
nature. The collapse of Christianity as an active part of people’s lives
means there is no transcendent alternative to the Utopian scheming. What
fills the void is the sterile conservatism we see in the pages of
National Review.

The years leading to the Great War had a similar feel. Europe had
abandoned Christianity following the 30 Years War. What came to fill the
void was a strange nationalism that was loosely based on blood and soil.
Contemporaneous accounts give one the sense that imperialism had run its
course. The Great War was the way to find out what came next.

Perhaps it is just a natural process. Marx described capitalism as the
organized destruction of productive forces. What he saw was a natural
process where competition
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commoditization"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commoditized</a> labor and
capital. Perhaps at the civilization level, material success destroys
the will to thrive. When there are no more hills to conquer, the leaders
lose focus and this devolves into petty, selfish behavior leading to no
good end. I don’t know, but today sure has the vibe of <a
