From time to time it is useful to pick up the spyglasses and take a look
at some of the smaller gatherings on the other side of the great divide.
The establishment Left is easy to see, as it takes up so much space and
makes so much noise. The same is true to a lesser extent with the
professional Right. The smaller subcultures are not as easy to see, but
they can be more useful in understanding the nature of the divide and
why there is a great divide in the first place.

<a
href="https://www.spiked-online.com/video/the-woke-war-against-the-enlightenment/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This conversation</a> between
someone calling himself Brendan O’Neil and someone calling himself Bret
Weinstein is a good example. It appears this is a regular show hosted by
Weinstein, where he invites on guests of “diverse opinion” to discuss
issues he thinks are important. The topic of this show, according to the
copy, was what he calls the woke war on the Enlightenment. Not much was
revealed in that regard, but it is useful in understanding why there is
a dissident right.

Now, Brendan O’Neil bills himself as a man of the Left. He is the editor
of something called Spiked, which is the successor of something called
*Living Marxism*, the journal of the Revolutionary Communist
Party. According to his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O%27Neill_(columnist)"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>, he is a
former Trotskyist and communist, but now he self identifies as a
Libertarian Marxist. That last bit only makes sense when you know that
Spiked is funded by the Charles Koch Foundation, the guys who bankroll
Reason Magazine.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Weinstein"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bret Weinstein</a> is a bit
more familiar to Americans. He is a member of the gratuitously
self-described “intellectual dark web.” This a group of mostly Jewish
writers who churn out conventional opinions for various mainstream
sites. Weinstein got famous because he was attacked by a mob on lunatics
on his college campus because he lacked enthusiasm for their latest
fashions. He became a symbol of mob action on campus. He describes
himself as a progressive and left-libertarian.

The first interesting thing to note in this is that both describe
themselves as left-libertarian in their own way. No one describes
themselves as right-libertarian, as that is something which no longer
exists. The so-called conservatives would claim they are now the home of
right-libertarians, but that is just another self-serving lie. They pose
no opposition to the Left on anything. Conservatism is nothing more than
a polite fiction now, a holding place for something yet to come.

Putting that aside, this conversation provides a good example of what
happens when you eliminate the right answer. You are left trying to mold
the wrong answer into something useful. Here, they refuse to consider
biology plays any role in culture and politics. In particular, they
refuse to accept that the people toppling statues and running Jewish
professors off campus are motivated by race. It can’t be race, so they
conjure strained explanations for what is happening.

At about the six-minute mark they get into identity politics. The claim
by the British guy is the lock downs broke the British collective
identity and that’s what caused mobs of people to go out and tear down
statues. He terms it a retreat into group identity, rather than
collective identity. The fact that the people doing the rioting were
non-white and their targets were white people and culture, seems to be
lost on him. It is a good example of what happens when you eliminate the
obvious.

The response from Weinstein is amusing. He makes the obvious point that
technology has made the world smaller. No matter how narrow your
interests, you can find people who share your interests on-line. In the
case of politics, it means on-line community around shared identity. He
suggests this is a problem, as people falling into these “echo chambers”
on-line eventually succumb to identity politics. It looked like he
wanted to use the term “false consciousness” at that point.

Later on, they refer to the “murder of George Floyd” which gives the
game away, but the show is still worth a listen. These tribes of the old
Left are struggling for the same reason that the so-called conservatives
and libertarians struggle. They cling to the notion that countries are
built around ideas. They think that ideology can replace biology as the
building block of human organization. The new man will completely submit
to the prevailing orthodoxy of the new society.

The creedal nation was always a left-wing idea and it was always wrong.
Like the Soviet Union, creedal America had a good run through the Cold
War. For a half a century, most Americans were happy to put aside their
natural identity in favor of patriotism, for the good of the country. It
was a useful way for the ruling class to organize the public in the
great game against communism. The Cold War is over and the reason to put
aside those natural identities is gone with it.

It should be no surprise that blacks in America and the new arrivals in
the West are the first to embrace this new reality. American blacks
never embraced the creedal nation stuff. They have always been the least
patriotic group. The new arrivals were never encouraged to drop their
natural identity. In fact, they were encouraged to embrace it as they
were told diversity is our strength. It is the occidentals that are the
last to catch on, but that is changing.

That is what you see in that video. Both men are clinging to the old
modes of thought, hoping to find a way to keep white people from
embracing identity politics. Nowhere in their discussion do they condemn
blacks or immigrants, even though they are the people rioting in the
streets. The long post-war period was, in fact, a break from human
reality, but now reality is roaring back. Yesterday men like those two
in the video cling to their creedal notions, while reality returns with
a vengeance.

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
