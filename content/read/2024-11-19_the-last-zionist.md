Lost in the excitement of Trump’s proposed cabinet appointment is the
lack of neocons in the list of foreign policy names. There are plenty of
pro-Israel people, no doubt suggested by the Israel Lobby. It is rather
clear that Trump made a deal with The Lobby in exchange for their
support in the general election. All his proposed foreign policy people
are Iran hawks, except for Gabbard. Otherwise, it is looking like an
Israel first foreign policy shop under Trump.

It is important to note that the neocons are not part of The Lobby. They
may have a lot of things in common, but they are different gangs with
different agendas. The neocons are not Zionists. In fact, they come out
of the anti-Zionist intellectual sphere with roots in international
communism. The neocons are happy to work with the Zionists and the
Israel Lobby when it suits their interests and vice-versa. As we saw
under Biden, they are also happy to work against the Zionists as well.

To some degree, Trump’s victory is due to the Biden administration
making the strategic blunder of prioritizing Ukraine over Israel after
October 7, 2023. Israel looked at that Hamas attack as the opportunity
to settle issues dating back to the Six-Day War, when Israel controlled
much of the land that the Zionist consider part of Greater Israel but
was given up in order to make peace. Netanyahu also imagined a regional
war, drawing in the United States to topple the Iranian regime.

Instead, the Biden admin worked to prevent a full-blown regional war,
often choking off support to Israel, at least in the view of The Lobby.
It turned out that the “arsenal of democracy” did not have enough arms
for both Israel and Ukraine, so the neocons running the Biden
administration chose to favor Ukraine. Further, The Lobby thought the
Biden administration failed to handle the anti-Israel protests that
broke out at elite college campuses after Israel launched war on Gaza.

The result was The Lobby backed Trump over Harris and Trump committed to
prioritizing Israel over all else in his foreign policy. This is one
reason the neocons are escalating in Ukraine and will continue to do so.
They think it could tie down the Trump administration in Ukraine and
prevent them from delivering on Iran. Again, there is no love lost
between the neocons and The Lobby. Contrary to what some believe, these
are not two faces of the same collective hive-mind.

This does not change the fact that the neocons are headed for the
political wilderness come January. While legacy conservatism would
welcome them back, the future of what we call the right is anti-neocon
and increasingly anti-interventionalist. The neocons have slithered back
to their home on the side we call the left, but they will run into the
same problem they now find with the so-called right. The groups in that
coalition have little interest in the neocon agenda.

Despite Trump’s commitment to the project, it is not all good news for
Israel, or the vast support network called The Israel Lobby. The main
problem is the political instability within Israel that could blow up
before Trump takes office. Protests against Netanyahu are a regular
feature in Israel. Netanyahu is slowly losing the
<a href="https://archive.is/gtHjy" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">judicial fight</a> surrounding his many corruption
probes. Then you have the
<a href="https://archive.is/9bQXD" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">hardliners</a> in his coalition, who are gaining power
as he struggles to maintain his position.

Making matters worse is the fact that it may no longer be possible to
bully Iran with the threat of military strikes. The tit-for-tat between
Israel and Iran revealed serious flaws in Iranian security, but it also
revealed newfound military prowess by Iran. On the one hand, Iran’s
missile and drone program is far more advanced than what had been
assumed until this exchange. On the other hand, her air defense
capabilities are also much better, largely due to Russian assistance.

Then you have the withering of support for Israel in America. The Lobby
has roots going back to the middle of the last century, where it
capitalized on certain events in the Second World War to build a vast
network of support for Israel. Much of this rested on the sense that the
Jews deserved special consideration due to what happened to them in the
war. Demographic change and the actuarial tables are slowly eroding this
base of support, both politically and morally.

Taken together, the ground is shifting underneath the feet of The Lobby,
as the state of Israel succumbs to its own demographic revolution and
the conditions in the Middle East change to reflect the reality of the
multipolar world. The Lobby might not fear the sight of an American
carrier on fire in the Persian Gulf, but the Trump people certainly do,
and they will have to adjust to this possibility. As with many other
things, Trump may be a transitional figure regarding American Zionism.

Put another way, the Zionists may be about to follow the neocons into
the political wilderness, despite having their guys in the White House.
American Zionism, like neoconservatism, is a creature of the last
century. It evolved for conditions that are slowly fading into the
history books. Like so much of American politics, it has failed to adapt
to the new reality. Just as the Biden administration was the last gasp
of neoconservatism, Trump may be the last gasp for American Zionism.

That does not mean the end of Israel or The Lobby. Unlike
neoconservatism, Zionism and Israel have a future. There is no interest
in the “destruction of Israel’ within the Arab world or among its new
friends in the multipolar order. Israel can maintain itself, even
without the unlimited support of America. Zionism and The Lobby simply
must adapt to the reality of the multipolar world and the changing role
of the American empire as it slowly returns to being a normal country.

While Trump could turn out to be the last Zionist in the old school
sense of it, he could also become the first Zionist in the new sense of
it. On the other hand, if he fumbles the problem of Iran, he could
simply be the last American Zionist. The images of an American carrier
on fire in the Persian Gulf would signal then end of public support for
Israel and The Lobby. Either way, Donald Trump is most likely the last
of the old school Zionist presidents and the last gasp of this version
of The Lobby.
