Sayre’s law states that “In any dispute the intensity of feeling is
inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake.” Another
form is, “Academic politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes
are so small.” This is often attributed to Richard Nixon or sometimes
Henry Kissinger. Intellectual history is full of famous battles between
rival camps over small differences. For example, two warring camps of
Straussians do battle over their understanding of the political
philosopher Leo Strauss.

This is not just true of the academy. People within in any organization
tend to give more weight to small issues than to the larger issues. The
famous example of this is the people designing a nuclear power plant
will have vicious disputes over where to place the employee bike shed.
Anyone familiar with corporate life knows that the major source of
tension between people is the trivial items. This is often referred to
as the law of triviality, but despite the name, it is a big part of
organizations.

This is something to keep in mind when examining the behavior of actors
within the modern political drama. Since the end of the Cold War, the
rancor has steadily increased, while the policy debate has steadily
narrowed. If you had no idea which political party was ascendant, you
just examined the policies coming from Washington the last thirty years,
you would be hard pressed to identify the two prevailing ideologies that
allegedly control both parties and the disputes between them.

This is where we see Sayre’s law at work. What emerged after the Cold
War is a general consensus on the big issues. The ruling elite is in
favor of open borders for both cultural and economic reasons. They favor
a global trade and economic regime that places the management of these
issues outside local legislatures. They embrace democracy as a sort of
civic theater, a drama that is never intended to impact policy, but
instead reinforces the prevailing morality of the elites.

Within this political structure, there is very little room for any
dispute, much less disputes over consequential matters. Our political
class, which includes the mass media, the commentariat and the donor
class, is left to fight pitched battles over trivial issues, often
invented for the purpose. In the case of the media, the selection
pressure over the last thirty years has resulted in a collection of
performers highly tuned to personalize trivial issues and express those
emotions on the stage.

It is why the Trump years were a cacophony of hysterics. This is how
everyone responds to everything. In the case of Trump, the entire
dramatis personae just happened to be on one side. Note how none of the
claims about his administration were rooted in policy. They never
engaged in policy disputes with him. It was all highly personal and
ridiculously petty. Seventy years ago, when Sayre made his observation
about the academy, this was the sort of thing he had in mind.

One reason for this is that whenever serious issues cannot be discussed,
the void is filled with heated debate of unserious issues. The result is
everyone is looking for a boutique thought to distinguish herself from
the mob. Everyone in politics at all levels believes they went into the
game to change the world. Instead of accepting their role as another
anonymous face in a chorus of actors, they embrace strange, but
pointless ideas to distinguish themselves from the crowd.

This is a very feminine instinct, which underscores just how feminized
our politics has become over the last half century. The reason the
military is always adjusting its uniform policy for female soldiers is
they are biologically tuned to signal their fitness to males in
competition with other females. The male soldiers are happy to wear the
uniform that is assigned to them. Females instantly seek to make small
trivial changes. This is the nature of our politics, where everyone
wants to be a special snowflake.

One result of this is that all political positions are positional goods.
Positional goods are goods that people value because they convey
standing within society. For example, South Asians like to wear gold as
a way to advertise their wealth. In African cultures around the world,
display items like expensive cars are common. In northern European
cultures, counter-signaling wealth is a form of positional good. The
trust fund guy who drives a twenty year old Volvo, for example.

In politics, especially left-wing politics, positions on issues and the
hierarchy of one’s issue list is a positional good. For example, the
forgiveness of student debt is an issue for those who stake out the
far-left position today. There is no plan as to how to execute such a
scheme. They do not appear to understand who holds the debt and what it
is used for by the system. The impossibility of forgiving college debt
is probably its chief appeal, as it lets them espouse something cost
free.

If you go down the laundry list of left-wing political positions, what
you find are aspirational and notional items. For four years the
Democrats could have struck a deal with Trump on roads and bridges. They
were too busy complaining about Hitler to engage in fruitful discussion.
In other words, to transform the notional into the practical would have
stripped the issue of its value. Something similar happened with
immigration, where Trump was willing to give the store away.

Mainstream politics is entirely about positional goods. This is true to
some degree of all politics, especially outsider politics, but we now
live in an age in which official political discourse is nothing more
than a personal spat in the faculty lounge. The difference between what
goes on in the academy and in Washington is that the latter revolves
around a central set of tenets that contain the ruling consensus. The
disputes, however, are every bit as trivial and pointless.
