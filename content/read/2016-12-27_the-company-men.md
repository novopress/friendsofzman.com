Since the major news outlets are run by the Cult, all of the focus has
been on how the Cult is dealing with the calamity of November 8, 2016.
Even two months on, members of the Cult are throwing tantrums in order
draw attention to their grief. For example, <a
href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/12/22/two-gay-moonbats-target-ivanka-trump-on-jetblue-flight/"
target="_blank">two degenerates had to be removed from a plane</a>
because they objected to Ivanka Trump riding on the same plane.
Unfortunately, the plane was still on the tarmac when they were removed.
Then there are <a
href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/how-many-fake-news-hate-hoaxes-were-exposed-today-alone/"
target="_blank">the daily hoaxes</a>, which are part of their grieving
process.

Less noticed is the ongoing collapse of the Conventional Right into
irrelevancy as it copes with the sudden realization that no one cares
what they think. National Review, for example,
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nationalreview.com"
target="_blank">has seen its traffic collapse</a> since
<a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZBlog/status/797037036943396864"
target="_blank">they went NeverTrump</a>. The ridiculous person they
have running the joint these days is out <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443184/national-review-fundraising-website-rebuild-editors-update"
target="_blank">begging for money</a> to redesign the site again. The
implication is that bad technology is the reason no one reads National
Review. The fact that they publish <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443153/transgender-bathrooms-conservative-defense-transgender-rights"
target="_blank">nonsense like this</a> gets no mention at staff
meetings, I bet.

While it is amusing to watch silly people like <a
href="http://cdn.thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/n_mj_cooke_130412-998x748.jpg"
target="_blank">Charles Cooke</a> struggle with the reality of his
situation, there are some intelligent and thoughtful people in the
Conventional Right trying to make sense of things. They correctly see
the rise of Trump, and the emergence of a counter culture on the Right,
as a dire threat to their thing. After all, why bother consulting the
grovelers at National Review when they are always wrong and there are
alternatives out there getting it right?

<a

target="_blank">This long piece</a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Continetti"
target="_blank">Matthew Continetti</a> the other day is a good read for
a number of reasons. Continetti is married to a daughter of Bill Kristol
and he is a true believer in the neo-conservative faith. Take that
however you like. This is the first bit of interest.

Like most of the box-tickers in the managerial class, Continetti is
largely unaware of what constitutes <a
href="http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/"
target="_blank">conservatism in English speaking countries</a>. For men
of the Conventional Right, conservatism is a list of policies and poses
that define their relationship with Progressives. The idea that
conservatism is a temperament, rather than a laundry list of policy
proposals is alien to these guys. They are men of the multiple choice
exam. Their options are always bounded by the number of choices provided
to them.

Moving along, this bit offers a glimpse into the mind of the neo-cons as
they face the dustbin of history.

> Trump has always been careful to distinguish himself from what he
> calls “normal conservative.” He has defined a conservative as a person
> who “doesn’t want to take risks,” who wants to balance budgets, who
> “feels strongly about the military.” It is for these reasons, he said

> dangerous position, defending a suspicious and resentful population
> amid IEDs and sniper attacks. The Iraq war, in this view, is an
> example of conservative writers and thinkers and politicians following
> trains of logic or desire to un-conservative conclusions.

One of the things that never gets discussed is just how spectacularly
wrong the Conventional Right was about the response to 9/11,
particularly Iraq. Everything the neo-cons said about the Muslim world
in the Bush years turned out to be wrong – disastrously wrong. There was
a prohibition on pointing this out for a while, but Trump said it, in
South Carolina of all places, and paid no price for it. Pretty much the
only refuge for the neo-cons is to pretend that everyone was wrong and
that Trump was just lucky in his opposition to the “invade the world”
portion of neo-conservatism.

This bit is comical because it highlights the foreignness of the
neo-cons and the Conventional Right.

> The conservatism of Donald Trump is not the conservatism of ideas but

What he is alluding to here is the deeply held belief, among
Conventional Conservatives, that the true leaders of society are the men
who manipulate ideas, not the men who manipulate other men or manipulate
things. The great revulsion for Trump among our betters is they see him
as a man that makes his way managing people things. He is not a man who
operates in the realm of ideas. Therefore, he is disqualified from
leading society. Continetti sees himself as Trump’s intellectual and
moral superior.

This bit is laugh out loud funny.

Guys like Continetti would not last five minutes in the world of real
estate or the world of fast food, for that matter. If he were to get a
job with Trump’s organization, it would be as a doorman or desk clerk.
Maybe in a decade or so he could be in a position to make a decision,
like selecting a cleaning contractor or a building maintenance vendor.
The reason the Conventional Right is in crisis is that normal,
conservative people, have grown weary of the smug condescension from
useless know-it-alls like Continetti.

In fairness to Continetti, he does seem to be figuring it out a bit.

> It is this specificity of attachment rather than adherence to a

Continetti cannot bring himself to contemplate how the people he labels
“street corner conservatives” arrived at their positions. That would
require a degree of self-awareness that he lacks. He is far too
concerned with distancing himself from these people, because
Conventional Conservatism is nothing more than a buffer between the
dominant ideology of Progressivism and the rest of us. In their heads,
they are standing athwart history yelling “stop”, but in reality they
are standing in front of you yelling “stop.”

I’ve gone way too long so I’ll circle back to this another day, but the
whole vibe from the Conventional Right is of a collection of middle
managers after a takeover. They are still wrapping their heads around
the fact that the guys coming in are now in charge. The old company men
will have to demonstrate their worth or be tossed out like obsolete
furniture. In the end, they will come around, because they have no
choice, but there will be plenty of moaning and complaining along the
way.
