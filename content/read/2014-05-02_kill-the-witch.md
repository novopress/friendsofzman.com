The various witch hunts going on America at any one time are pathetic
and degenerate, but at least we’re not burning the witches or throwing
them in jail. That’s going to change as the Left becomes more deranged,
so it is coming soon. Here in America we are a little behind the other
English speaking nations. Unencumbered with a First Amendment, [they
will throw people in jail for saying unapproved
things](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2614834/Arrested-quoting-Winston-Churchill-European-election-candidate-accused-religious-racial-harassment-repeats-wartime-prime-ministers-words-Islam-campaign-speech.html).

*A candidate in the European elections was arrested on suspicion of
racial harrassment after quoting a passage about Islam, written by
Winston Churchill, during a campaign speech.*

*Paul Weston, chairman of the party Liberty GB, made the address on the
steps of Winchester Guildhall, in Hampshire on Saturday.*

*A member of the public took offence at the quote, taken from
Churchill’s The River War and called police.*

*The passage from the book, written by the wartime Prime Minister and
first published in 1899, focuses on Churchill’s observations about Islam
while serving during the Anglo-Egyptian reconquest of the Sudan.*

*Mr Weston told his audience: ‘Improvident habits, slovenly systems of
agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property
exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.*

*‘Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know
how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social
development of those who follow it.*

*‘No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being
moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.’*

*Police officers arrested Mr Weston, mid-speech, for failing to comply
with their request to move on under the powers of a dispersal order made
against him.*

*He was further arrested on suspicion of religious or racial
harassment.*

Behaviorally, humans have not changed a whole lot since we moved from
hunter-gatherer to settled life. Religion is what holds people together,
fostering cooperation and providing ways to punish the freeloaders and
trouble makers. Two thousand years ago Mr. Weston would have been stoned
for saying bad things about Woden. One thousand years ago he would have
been broken on the wheel for saying bad things about Jesus. Today, he is
arrested for saying bad things about Mohamed.

I wonder sometimes if we are even that sophisticated. There’s strong
evidence that the smart fraction running pagan society knew it was
mostly nonsense. They enforced the rules because it was the only way
they knew how to keep everyone in line. The Catholic Church went after
Utopian heretics because they knew they disrupted society (as we see
today). They let a lot of harmless heretics go unmolested. Today’s
ruling clergy seems to really believe in Cultural Marxism.
