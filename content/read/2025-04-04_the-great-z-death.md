One of the downsides of writing and talking about the current scene is
that you often want to kill yourself or kill someone. There are only so
many stories about a crazed judge issuing an equally crazed rulings you
can read before you want to spit on your hands, raise the black flag and
start slitting throats. To paraphrase the late comic George Carlin,
there are a lot of people who need to be killed.

It is why it is a good idea to look away from the daily car wreck that
is the public square from time to time. It is why I quit Twitter. I will
post links to my work there, but otherwise it is on mute. The most
popular figures on that platform exist to irritate everyone else, so
being active on that site is like inviting people into your home so they
can break things and urinate on your carpets.

It is also why this week’s show is deliberately lighthearted. I randomly
selected questions from <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Revised-Updated/dp/0761177310"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">big book of questions</a> and answered
them without preparation. I am not sure how many I got through, but it
is probably about twenty. The book has three hundred questions in it, so
I will probably revisit this format in the future when I feel like
raising the black flag and slitting throats.

I have not read all of the questions. For the show I started at the
first one and kept going until I ran out of time. I skipped some of them
because they were not interesting to me, but that still leaves plenty of
material. The interesting thing about the ones I cover in the show is
that they have no link to current events, but they relate to things far
more important to daily life.
