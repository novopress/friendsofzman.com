When I was a kid, the big deal in sports news was Joe Gilliam, the
quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Gilliam was the first
black quarterback to start a season opener after the AFL–NFL merger in
1970, which is when people date the start of the modern NFL. Gilliam was
benched eventually and never got another chance to start in the NFL.
There was grumbling that his demotion was because he was black, but his
poor play and drinking problems were the real reason. Still, even then,
the default was to blame whitey.

What this means is that for my lifetime, the sporting press has been
hunting for the great black quarterback. There have been plenty of black
quarterbacks, but none have been elite or counted as greats in their
era. The closest was probably Warren Moon, but he never won anything.
Recently, there’s been an effort to make Cam Newton and Russell Wilson
the black Joe Montana, thus proving that white people are Hitler. The
trouble is the former is not very good and the latter has no interest in
being anyone’s Sambo.

black quarterbacks in the NFL tend not to be elite passers, and
therefore non-elite quarterbacks. Oddly, the proof of this is a white
guys, Tim Tebow. In high school, he was used as a quarterback because he
was big and could run. In college, he was used the same way in Urban
Meyer’s single-wing system. He had no career in the pros, because he was
a terrible passer. If he had been turned into a linebacker in college,
he would probably be in the NFL now.

That does not change the Cult’s desire to find the black Tom Brady and

This urge to make Dak Prescott into Tom Brady in black face is perfectly
consistent with Progressive thoughts about black people. They don’t
really like black people very much. They like the *idea* of black
people. Progressives have an image of the idealized black guy, the Magic
Negro, that they believe will fulfill the prophesies about race in
America. Barak Obama is about as close as they have come to finding
their Big Foot and he did not usher in the end times. Instead he was a
mulatto Jimmy Carter.

That’s the thing with Progressives and race. They don’t care about
blacks as people. They see black people as something they can sacrifice
on the Progressive altar, in order to get grace. American sportswriters
will now be competing with one another in piety displays, showing their
wonderfulness by how much they swoon over Dak Prescott. Whether or not
the kid has any interest in being their Magic Negro is immaterial. He
does not get a say in this as he is just a prop anyway.

Dak Prescott appears to be a level headed young man with no interest in
changing his name to Hamilton or dancing on a string for the Progressive
media. But, the Left has a way of getting their man, which in these
cases means turning the object of their affection into a white-hating
public nuisance. Colin Kaepernick started out as a sensible young man
enjoying early and unexpected success in the NFL. Now he is the symbol
for what has gone wrong with the NFL. Fans cheer for him to get hurt.

target="_blank">John Derbyshire called Hamilton</a> a minstrel show and
it is a good label for it. In fact, Progressive race mongering over the
last half century has been a long live action minstrel show. Instead of
whites in black face, Progressive deploy blacks to play the roles chosen
for them. Blacks are just props used by good whites to distinguish
themselves from bad whites and, at times, spite those bad whites. If
real black people actually benefit, it is an unintended consequence.
It’s something Hispanics should bear in mind.
