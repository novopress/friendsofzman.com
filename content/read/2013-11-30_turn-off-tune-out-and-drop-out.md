Timothy Leary coined the phrase “Turn on, tune in, drop out” in the
1960’s.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to the Wiki
entry</a>, it was 1967 and may very well have been a marketing ploy. The
Wiki entry is a little vague on that, but Leary was sort of a PT Barnum.
He was good at getting people to pay attention to him and he figured out
how to turn that into a business. Unlike Barnum, Leary was not offering
tickets to a freak show. Leary and his camp followers were the freak
show. He was all about being famous and that got him writing and
speaking gigs.

Anyway, that phrase came to mind when reading <a

for kids and pop technology is for kids too. There was a time when
e-mail was for young people, but it eventually proliferated. Now e-mail
is the domain of old people. Texting is for young people now, but that’s
even starting to be replaced with things like Instagram. Facebook is the
domain of grandparents and foreigners now. In other words, the platforms
keep shifting, like all fads, but at some point the trend has to run out
of road.

As the population of the West grows older, maybe the new trend will be
something like the title of this post. The Boomers, who are not just
hitting retirement in heavy numbers, will drop off the system entirely
and enjoy their golden years in a fashion similar to their youth in old
white America. It won’t be a fad, so much as a lack of interest. The
whole point of social media is to collect data on people in order to
sell them stuff and keep them from holding the wrong opinions. Old
people are not the targets, so they will be ignored.

On the other hand, maybe the oldsters clogging up social media platforms
and demanding rules that cater to them will set off a different fad. The
young will get off social media entirely and instead go onto video
platforms they can use on their phones. It’s not quite dropping out, but
it is a return to a form of face to face interaction.  Fads are funny
things, so it’s not unreasonable to think a back to basics fad could get
going. Maybe dropping out will one day simply mean disconnecting from
the grid like a normal person.
