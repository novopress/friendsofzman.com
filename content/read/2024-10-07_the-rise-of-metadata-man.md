path of Iran and Israel, a post about the most efficient way to install,
operate and maintain the guillotines after the revolution and the Sunday

For the longest time, before we had loads of tests and studies on the
topic of intelligence, being smart was something like pornography. It
was not easy to define, but you knew it when you saw it. The smart
person was well-read. You knew this because he could quote famous
writers from memory. In fact, memorizing lots of things was essential to
being a smart person. Of course, the only way to memorize lots of things
was to read lots of things.

This view of intelligence remains with us, despite the fact there is
little reason to remember much of anything. The guy who can quote a
famous work of literature at the dinner party is assumed to be smart.
The guy who speaks more than one language must be smart, because he had
to memorize a second vocabulary. The fact that he does nothing useful
with his life is overlooked. That old assumption about having a head
full of information indicating smartness is still with us.

We may be on the cusp of that old notion fading away. In everyone’s
pocket is a device that gives you access to the sum total of human
knowledge. Not only is there no reason to memorize how many feet are in
a mile, but there is also no reason to remember street names or how to
get from one place to the other. That magic device will tell you where
to go and how long it will take. It will also tell you in whatever
language you like, in whatever country you find yourself.

Technology is not only making information available to us, but it is
also about to make it much easier to access by way of Large Language
Models. The hype around artificial intelligence obscures the fact that
most decisions are normative, so those can never be made by robots
unless we program the robot to do it. What AI will do for us is make the
vast stock of information online easier to access. You will no longer
have to be clever to search the internet for answers to your questions.

It will also make learning a language somewhat pointless. Your mobile
device can already be used as something of a universal translator. It
can translate what you say in your language to a close enough version of
another language. You can scan foreign words, and an app will translate
them. We are not far from the point where anyone from anywhere can
communicate to everyone through a real-time translation service they can
access through their mobile device.

Einstein famously quipped that he had no reason to remember how many
feet were in a mile because he could look it up in a book. The same
thing is about to happen to the study of languages for most people.
Unless you are linguist or study a foreign culture, there is no
practical reason to learn another language. The same is true for lots of
things like dates of specific events and the names of important people.
What will matter in the future is using the tools to access this data.

That sounds like heresy to most people, but we see this happening all
around us as the internet becomes ubiquitous. We are losing patience for
the long argument or the slow-paced story, because we are used to
tapping a few keys and getting the pay off without all the extra stuff.
For young people who have been socialized on the internet, waiting for
anything is intolerable now. They just want the answer, and they have
little interest in the context around the answer.

Schools are struggling with this reality. It is not just students using
their phones to get the answer on a test. They can use the internet to
write their papers and do so in a way that makes it hard to detect the
fraud. The same tools a teacher can use to find plagiarism or answer
sharing are available to the students, who can then make their work look
original enough to pass the test. Getting a good grade is not about
learning the material, but about mastering technology.

There is a practical genius to it. Education in this age is about
passing through a series of gates to get a credential. Few students use
much of what they learn in school in their work life, so cheating makes
a lot of sense to them. In a way, they are mastering what they will
actually use as an adult to game an antiquated and often pointless
education system in order to attain a credential. This is especially
true for college where most of what is taught has no practical value to
the student.

We are moving from a world where being smart was about memorizing lots
of information to a world where being smart means knowing how to find
the information quickly and efficiently. Put another way, being smart is
not about the store of data, but the store of metadata. Knowing the
words, phrases and context of data is what makes finding the data
possible. The same skull packed with metadata has access to vastly more
data than the skull could ever hold.

This presents a bit of a problem in that we lack ways to display our
stock of metadata, so how can we know who is smart? In the old days, we
could safely assume the guy quoting Longfellow was above average in
smarts. There is no way to quote metadata in a way that tells us much of
anything. On the other hand, is someone highly skilled at finding the
answer actually smart? It is, after all, a form of problem solving which
is the skill we expect to be honed through conventional education.

This also raises the issue of formal assessment. Our systems assume that
the person who scores high on the math and verbal portion of the SAT,
for example, is smarter than the person who scores poorly on one or both
portions. That will probably remain true in the metadata age, but what
about the person who scores high on his verbal, but average on the math
compared to the reverse? We value math over verbal, for practical
reasons, but in the metadata age verbal skills may be more valuable.

Of course, all of this points to something else. We are becoming an
increasingly fragile species due to our dependence on technology. A
prolonged GPS outage, for example, would mean deliveries grind to a
halt. No one owns a map, much less has the ability to use one to
navigate. If the power goes out, our advanced skills at finding
information on the internet quickly becomes a liability. Suddenly we are
in a world of simpletons who do not know how anything works.
