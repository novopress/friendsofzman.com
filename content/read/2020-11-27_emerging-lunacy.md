Emergent behavior is one of those things that people struggle to grasp,
because it seems to violate the expected cause and effect relationship.
Most people operate on the assumption that whatever we are seeing is
caused by something that can also be seen or at least described. Of
course, most people like to think there is some human actor behind
everything, operating from the normal human motivations. It is always
tempting to reduce things to the personal as it is relatable.

There are lots of examples in nature of emergent behavior.
Cross-breeding of plants can result in a characteristic that does not
exist in the two plants that have been crossbred by a curious gardener.
Domestic animal breeders, from time to time, will bump into this. The
Ocicat is a great example crossbreeding two animals and getting a result
that has qualities not present in the parents. Insects colonies are a
great example of emergent behavior.

Something similar can happen with human behavior. Put the right group of
people in the right situation and you get behavior that seems to spring
from nowhere. Some historians have argued this is what happened in
Germany in the period after the Great War when the Nazi rose to power.
The panic over witches and witchcraft in early New England is another
cited example. All of a sudden, people began to act in ways that were
not typical of their past behavior.

This is, in part, what we are experiencing today. The people in charge
have unleashed forces they do not understand for short term gain. The
massive wave of irregularities in the election are one result. The
bizarre, superstitious behavior of the Covidians is another
manifestation. These people have been swept up in a frenzy and have
become untethered from the normal restraints. “Through any means
necessary” has become a rallying cry for direct action against the
imagined enemy.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
