One of the difficult things for most Americans to accept is that the
people on the ballot every election have little role in public policy.
The way the system is supposed to work is that the voters select their
elected officials, who then meet and agree on new laws and changes to
the law. They also pick the people in charge of the many agencies that
carry out the laws passed by the elected officials. In reality, the
people in those elected offices play almost no role in legislation and
policy.

The easiest place to see this is in foreign policy. In the last
election, there was little mention of foreign relations. Trump pledged
his unconditional support for Israel, which every candidate is required
to do in America, but otherwise he had little to say about what is
happening in the world. Those running for House and Senate seats were
mostly silent of foreign affairs, aside from pledging their loyalty to
Israel. We are in a proxy war with Russia and China, and no one talks
about it.

One main reason for those House and Senate candidates not saying much of
anything is they have no role in the process. Many of them could not
find Ukraine on a map, despite cheering wildly for Zelensky when he
spoke to Congress. Only those who have been around for a decade or more
understand why Ukraine is an issue. Some of them have been invited to
get a taste of the side action, which is the primary benefit to sticking
around in Congress for a long time.

Foreign policy is the domain of the executive, but it is obvious that
the President has little role in the process. Joe Biden was a vegetable
for his term in office. So much so that decisions on most things were
delegated to various appointees. Jake Sullivan and Anthony Blinken ran
foreign policy, but even they were only in charge of a small portion of
what the world sees as American foreign policy. The reason for that is
much of it is now done off the books, outside the official system.

For example, the years long effort to regime change the country of
Georgia was not a White House or State Department caper, in the sense
that there were high level meetings about the program or decisions made
by the senior staffers. This operation was run by the informal network
of formal and informal operational nodes that make up the American
foreign policy community. It is not really accurate to call it American,
as it now includes nodes around the West.

For example, last year the Russians raided a group of call centers
operating in Russia, that were organized by something called The Milton
Group, by the former Minister of Defense of Georgia,
<a href="https://davidkezerashvili.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">David Kazerashvili</a>. Amusingly, these call centers
were intended to operate various frauds in the West, but they also
helped organize the pro-Western protests in Georgia. One center was run
by an Israeli and Ukrainian citizen and the other by an Israeli and
Georgian citizen.

How a normal fraud operation gets repurposed into a mechanism to topple
governments is not a big mystery. It turns out that there is more money
in regime change than in scamming old people out of their pensions. That
money comes from the thicket of NGO’s and clandestine government
operations that often operate independent from Western governments. It
is unlikely that elected officials in the West had any idea who was
running the Georgia caper.

One reason why this shadow foreign policy establishment remains unknown
to most elected officials is much of it predates their time in politics.
For example, one of the main organizers of the Georgia regime change
operation was an
<a href="https://canvasopedia.org/who-we-are/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">organization</a> called CANVAS, which operates out of
Serbia. It is a spinoff of a group called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otpor" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Otpor</a>, which was founded in the 1990’s when the
former Yugoslavia was falling apart after the end of the Cold War. Guess
where they got their money?

CANVAS now operates all over the world, targeting regimes that are
coincidentally on the list of regimes targeted for a color revolution.
They were involved in the effort to overthrow the Belarussian government
and in the overthrow of the Ukraine government during the Obama
administration. Of course, that event haunts us today. It has been made
infamous for the scenes of Victoria Nuland waddling around Kiev, handing
out cookies to the pro-Western protestors.

Speaking of Toria Nuland, she was not only responsible for the Ukraine
catastrophe that continues to rage, but she has been a lifelong advocate
for regime change as the official policy of the American government.
This is why after she left the Biden administration, she landed a
<a href="https://www.ned.org/experts/victoria-nuland/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> at the National Endowment for Democracy, one of
those semi-formal nodes in the foreign policy community. She will bring
years of regime change experience to the organization.

The National Endowment for Democracy is one of those groups that has
been around longer than most politicians, so it is background noise to
them, but it plays a key role in what manifests as American foreign
policy. It was founded in 1983 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gershman" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Carl Gershman</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weinstein" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Allen Weinstein</a>. They worked in the Reagan
administration and then formed several NGO’s, all with help from
government money. Like so many NGO’s, it is a clearing house for money
and international activism.

There is a good bet that there is not a single Senator involved in
foreign policy oversight who has ever heard of the men who founded NED.
They have no idea that there are lines in the State Department budget
sending money in the form of grants and vendor contracts to groups like
NED. They certainly have no idea about how the State Department
encourages corporate giving to these groups. It is a world that operates
in the shadows, where elected officials rarely tread.

These groups are not just operating abroad. They play a major role in
building narratives in which the elected official operates. For example,
there are ads on YouTube from a
<a href="https://ccl.org.ua/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">group</a>
called Center for Civil Liberties, that claims Vladimir Putin is
kidnapping Ukrainian children. This group wants your help to stop him.
If you go to their
<a href="https://ccl.org.ua/en/about-the-ccl/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">about section</a>, you see they are supported by
familiar names, like the National Endowment for Democracy and the
American State Department.

What this means is those ads telling American YouTube viewers that
Vladimir Putin is kidnapping Ukrainian children are, in some way,
sponsored by the American government, operating through a proxy. Much of
what elected official believe to be reality is the product of such
operations. One point of this network of NGO’s is to help shape and
control the information space. You can see why Washington is obsessed
with creating narratives rather than reality.

This is just in the area of foreign policy. Every day politicians are
briefed by groups they think are grassroots organization, but in fact
are marionettes operated by one of the formal or informal organizations.
The media is peppered with press releases and provided copy for their
outlets. Most important, the organizations can introduce the right
people to the right people, with “right” being the key word. If you play
ball and avoid asking the wrong questions, you can be a right person.

It is why voting seems to make things worse. The people making decisions
that matter to you are never on the ballot. The people on the ballot are
often less informed about how things work than the voters. The reason
for that is the parties select for the compliant and the incurious.
Those who get too curious or refuse to play ball will find themselves
with a primary opponent and no money. It is why “our democracy” is a
rhetorical and literal fig leaf for the Deep State.
