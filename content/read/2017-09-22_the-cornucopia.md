week I explain how to properly strangle a hobo with your belt, the best
way to dispose of a body and how to make sure your daughter does not
bring home a black guy. Well, maybe not all of that, but I do have some
interesting topics to gas on about this week. It’s not a museum quality
show, but I have some good stuff, I think.

Since there was some concern about Gab’s future, after it was attacked
by some social justice warriors, I did not prepare to post this on Gab.
Since the danger has past, I’ll be posting a bonus track there each
week. That way, it helps get people on Gab and does a solid for the good
guys fighting to keep the lamps from going out in the West.

For this week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and
segments from the show. I am now on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis
can listen to me on their Hitler phones.
