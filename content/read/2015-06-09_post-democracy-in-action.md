I tried to make the point the other day that the primary role of elected
governments is to fool the public into going along with that which is
against their interests. Increasingly, the management of national
affairs is in the hands of extra-national organizations like the EU. The
people can vote themselves silly, but public policy will be determined
by the unelected elites of the global managerial class.

It’s not just the global elite dodging the will of local populations
with the aid of national governments. There’s a degree of spite in much
of what we see going on these days. The EU could probably make some
concessions in Greece to smooth things over, but they really want to rub
the Greeks nose in that turd sandwich they are making them eat.

Pat Buchanan said thirty years ago that America is the first country
where the elite openly despise the people and culture that puts them
into the elite. He was wrong in that the Euros have reached that point
first, but America is trying hard to catch them. That’s blazingly
obvious as you see in [this story breaking from
Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/08/exclusive-kevin-mccarthy-pressured-by-republican-conference-whats-the-rush-on-obamatrade-plans-with-its-global-governance-hidden-inside/).

*Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA)*  
*67% is pressuring House GOP leadership, particularly Majority Leader
Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)*  
*47%, to delay plans to muscle Obamatrade through the House of
Representatives quickly. In in a letter to McCarthy obtained exclusively
by Breitbart News, he’s asking leadership to slow down and consider the
ramifications of what it is doing.*

*“I write to you today to request that you delay any vote on fast-track
authority for the Executive until the President has made public all text
and information pertaining to the new economic union known as the
Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission, as well the ‘Living Agreement’
authority,” Hunter wrote to McCarthy, his fellow California Republican.
“My concern is that this allows the President and the members of the
union to change the agreement and its membership following adoption.”*

*Hunter’s concern is well founded.*

*Despite claims from some Obamatrade proponents to the contrary, if
Congress approves Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) which would fast-track
and all but ensure the approval of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)
Pacific Rim trade deal, the “Living Agreement” inside the TPP would
allow President Obama and the other TPP nations to add China or any
other country for that matter to the deal without seeking approval from
Congress.*

I’m a pro-trade sort as are most people in America. Most of the GOP are
rabidly pro-trade. This is not a trade deal, however. It is way to
circumvent the voters and obscure future evasions from them. You can
feel the sneering contempt for the voters in the reaction of leadership
to attempts to make the details of this bill public. It’s as if the GOP
is deliberating spiting their own voters.

Do they hold the people in contempt? Many of them surely do. Nancy
Pelosi would hold random beheadings of commoners on the mall if she
could get away with it. Most simply have decided that representative
government no longer works for them and their paymasters. The men and
women in Congress serve the people who pay them and it is not the guys
reading this wondering who to vote for in the primaries.
