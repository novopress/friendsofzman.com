I’m not a big fan of rounding people and shooting them, but I can
understand the temptation.
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/13/living/girl-scout-boycott/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story</a> about a demented parent
torturing her child and then demanding everyone else indulge her is
sickening. This is how indulging lunacy ends up as something much worse.

*Bobby Montoya wanted to join the Girl Scouts, setting off a national
debate.*

*The Girl Scout cookie can’t seem to catch a break.*

*Under fire in years past for including trans fats, high fructose corn
syrup and palm oil in its cookies, the
<a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Girl
Scouts</a>‘ current cookie selling season is under fire because of
policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of the
cookies.*

*A group calling itself
<a href="http://www.honestgirlscouts.com" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">HonestGirlScouts.com</a> has posted a YouTube video
calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies in response to a Colorado
troop’s decision to allow a 7-year-old transgender child into its troop.
Gay rights and transgender rights groups have reported a grassroots LGBT
movement of supporters buying Girl Scout cookies in response to the
video.*

*“I’ve decided to purchase as many boxes as my modest budget will allow
and donate them to the local LGBTQ community center,” says Mara Morken,
a lesbian stay-at-home mom in Fargo, North Dakota. “I want to show
support for GSUSA in their honorable decision to allow all girls to
participate in their programs. However I do not want that support to
show itself on my thighs, so I will donate the entire cookie order!”*

*After an initial burst of publicity around the nearly 8-minute video
featuring a teen Girl Scout wearing a Girl Scout sash, the video has
been made private on YouTube. However, it’s still available for viewing
elsewhere on the Internet.*

*“I ask all fellow Girl Scouts who want a true, all-girl experience not
to sell any Girl Scouts cookies until GSUSA (Girl Scouts of the USA)
addresses our concerns,” says the girl, identified as a teen named
Taylor, a troop member from California, in some news reports. “I ask all
parents who want their girls to be in a safe environment to tell their
leaders why you will not allow your girls to make any more money for
GSUSA.”*

*The video was prompted by the case of Bobby Montoya, whose mother [told
a CNN affiliate in
October](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/10/25/dnt-boy-wants-to-be-a-girl-scout.kusa?iref=allsearch)
that a troop leader initially told her that Bobby couldn’t join the
troop because Bobby “has boy parts,” even though her child identifies as
a girl.*

*The Girl Scouts of Colorado blamed the initial decision to exclude the
child on ignorance of the scouts’ policy. The state scouts said Bobby
was welcome to join Girl Scouts. “If a child identifies as a girl and
the child’s family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado
welcomes her as a Girl Scout,” said the Colorado Girl Scouts, in a
statement to a CNN affiliate.*

*The Honest Girl Scouts website says that the Girl Scouts use cookie
income to promote “abortion and LGBT agendas,” introduces Girl Scouts to
“the concept of sexual rights for children without parent consent” and
is rewriting badge books to include “radical activists and gay role
models.”*

*On its website, HonestGirlScouts.com states that the group is comprised
of current and former Girl Scouts, leaders, parents, volunteers and
lifetime members. When contacted via its listed Gmail account to
comment, someone replied that the group’s “legal counsel has advised us
not to comment or do interviews until further notice.”*

*Mara Keisling, executive director of the
<a href="http://transequality.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, dismissed
the video as an attempt by conservative activists to raise funds. “This
issue not withstanding, the Girl Scouts is a really good organization,”
says Keisling. “It’s been a really good place for kids to learn things.
(This controversy) will die down. We as a society are progressing and
the outdated reactionary attitude that poor girl was put up to in that
video, those attitudes are dying out.”*

*Other LGBT groups are taking a tongue-in-check approach to the debate,
encouraging people to eat more Girl Scout cookies. “Girl Scout cookies
may not be so great for your waistline but they are great for being
inclusive,” says Liz Owen, spokeswoman for
<a href="http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=194&amp;srcid=-2"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parents and Friends of Lesbians and
Gays</a> (P-FLAG). Owen reports hearing from people who decided to break
their New Year’s resolutions to go on a diet with a Girl Scout cookies
purchase.*

It’s one thing for adults to play dress up, pretending they are the
other sex. That’s weird and slightly disgusting, but it is a free
country. When they demand the rest of us go along with the lunacy, a
line has been crossed. Humans come in one of two sexes, male and female.
Yes, there are defects where humans posses both a Y-chromosome and two
X-chromosomes, but that is rare and not the case with “transgendered.”

When adults begin to subject children to this lunacy, we’re talking
about child abuse. The demented woman claiming her boy child is female
is just trying to get attention for herself at the expense of her child.
The poor kid will end up needing years of therapy to overcome what his
mother has done to him, in addition to having to deal with the bad genes
he inherited from this nut.
