At some point in the future, the ape historians may look back at this
time and call it the Bush – Clinton period of the American empire. The
period started with the first Bush presidency in 1989, roughly
corresponding with the end of the Cold War and concluding sometime
around now. It is hard to know if this period is at an end or if it will
stagger on for a while longer. It would surprise no one if Hillary
Clinton or one of the Bush clan takes one last stab at the presidency in
2024.

The rivalry between the Bush family and the Clinton family mirrors the
rivalry between the Compson and Snopes family in the William Faulkner
novels. The Compson family represented the old Southern order that
emerged from the wreckage of the Civil War and Reconstruction. The
Snopes family represented the new, white trash culture that was slowly
overtaking the old order. It was order and dignity at the end of its
time versus an emergent disorder and lack of dignity.

In the American context, the Bush family represent the old WASP order
that cannot update its thinking to the present. They are built for the
old America that was confident and ascendant, but they find themselves
at the end of empire. Desperate to maintain their status and position,
they aligned with shady characters like Mexican cartel members, the
Saudi Royal family, and the neoconservatives. This toxic blend of
anti-American interests would shape the empire for decades.

The Clintons are far less grandiose. Like the Snopes clan, they
represent the new order that is not really order at all. Instead, it
represents the vermin that infest the dying old order, doing anything
and everything to get an edge on the other rats. Unlike the Bush clan,
they don’t seek power for prestige. They seek power for profit. They cut
deals with China in the 1990’s for campaign cash. Then Hillary was
auctioning off state secrets from her perch in the State Department
during the Obama years.

The analogy breaks down a bit as the Clinton family was not productive
like the Snopes family, so there will be no second and third generation.
On the other hand, they did unleash the new breed of Baby Boomer
politician. While biologically unrelated to the Clinton family, the
entire political class has been shaped by them. The Poppy Bush type is
nowhere to be found in modern politics, but the political class is thick
with women who admire Hillary and men who think like Bill.

Just as the Faulkner novels play out in the shadow of the old order
represented by the Compson family, American politics continues to play
out in the shadow of the Bush clan and their efforts to remain at the
top of the old order. Even though the 20-year debacle in Afghanistan has
ended, it remains a big player in politics. Of course, the
neoconservatives are still embedded in the system. It was their brains
and the gross stupidity of George Bush that made Afghanistan possible.

The Bush family, like a drug resistant virus, will not go away. George
Bush gave a speech to on 9/11, as Joe Biden was cognitively unable to do
it. Of course, he took the opportunity to remind everyone of his
contempt for ordinary people. He said of the January 6 protestors that
“they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing
duty to confront them.” Despite his inability to string a sentence
together on his own, that perfectly captures the sentiment of the ruling
class.

Taken together, the last thirty years have been a decaying ruling elite
willing to strike any deal necessary to maintain their position. This
includes allowing a rapacious vermin-like Clinton clan to gnaw away at
the social fabric. One side looks at the American society as fuel to be
used for the imperial engines, while the other side just sees America as
a host on whom they will feed until it dies. Nowhere in the struggle
between the two sides are the interests of the people.

No analogy is perfect. Donald Trump is certainly a member of the Snopes
side of this fight, but hated by the clan nonetheless. He saw his
opportunity for some personal gory in 2016 and he seized it. He had no
grand plans or even a desire to reform the system, so he spent his time
on personal projects. In a way, Trump was the new and improved version
of Bill Clinton. It is a nice bit of narrative irony that Hillary was
defeated by one her husband’s old golf buddies.

An important potential parallel between this age and the Faulkner novels
is that the story preceded the upheavals in the American South. The new
South that emerged in the late 20th century was not like either side of
the struggle. The world of Faulkner is a distant memory now. Similarly,
the old imperial order represented by the Bush clan and the grasping
thievery of Boomer politics represented by the Clinton family is not
going to survive the dissolution of empire.

What emerges from the inevitable turmoil that comes when these two modes
of politics collapse under the weight of their own immorality is
unknown. What is certain is a period of upheaval where the empire
contracts in fits and starts, staggering from one crisis to the next.
Each crisis shrinks the empire a little more until the very concept of
empire is no longer tenable. The people will be spectators as the dying
elites savage one another for their share of the declining profits.

The lesson from the Faulkner tales is that elites must be replaced by
elites. The Snopes clan either had to evolve into an elite or be
replaced along with the old elite as represented by the Compson family.
That means the Bush side of the struggle will not last, but neither will
the Clinton side. Rapacious thievery can never be the foundation for  a
new elite. A generation from now, the people at the top of whatever
comes of America will be nothing like the ruling class of today.
