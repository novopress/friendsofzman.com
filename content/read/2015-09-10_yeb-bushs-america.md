The 2016 election is essentially about whether America will remain a
country. You can’t be a country if you lose control of your borders, but
that’s fixable. If you lose control of who is populating your lands,
there’s no coming back from that mistake. The ruling class loses all of
its legitimacy and the fracture society divides itself along ethnic
lines with its own leaders and borders.

The public is finally coming to terms with what’s happening as <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">stories like this</a> become common.

*Multiple buildings and vehicles in Loudon County, VA were vandalized
with graffiti tags bearing the moniker of a notorious El Salvadorian
street gang early Tuesday morning.*

*According to WUSA9, several vehicles on Gatwick Square and Wintergrove
Drive were discovered with “MS-13″ spray painted on the exteriors.*

*Additionally, walls, pillars and two parked school buses at nearby
Trailside Middle School were also found bearing the gang tags.*

*MS-13 is known as one of the most violent gangs in the world, and has
been connected to a string of murders on both the East and West
coasts.*  
*They are so feared in El Salvador, prison officials have allowed a
detention center filled with 2,500 known members to essentially run
itself.*

*Trailside Middle School is located roughly 8 miles from Parkside High
School, where recently murdered 17-year-old Danny
Centeno-Miranda attended classes.*

*Centeno-Miranda was shot twice on Sept. 4 in Sterling, VA by
20-year-old Henry Dominguez-Vasquez, 18-year-old Juan Aguirre-Zelaya and
an unnamed 17-year-old.*

*All four men were in the country illegally.*  
*Dominguez-Vasquez and Aguirre-Zelaya were charged with possession of a
firearm by a person who is not a citizen of the United States and
accessory after the fact, and the juvenile was charged with 2nd degree
murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.*

For those unfamiliar with the area around the Imperial Capital, Loudon
County is an upscale area with loads of SWPL-ville types. The median
household income is $117,000 which makes it one of the richest counties
in the nation. Million dollar homes are not uncommon there. To have a
Salvadorian street gang operating there is like having The Black
Guerrilla Family operating on Martha’s Vineyard.

This is ¡Yeb! Bush’s America. MS-13 has been operating in Northern
Virginia for a long time now. The press has ignored it because they were
more afraid of the bad whites and their hate thoughts than the
gangsters. Now that the gangsters are showing up in the neighborhoods of
the ruling class, the stories are showing up in the press. My guess is
the majority of the managerial class is wondering if open borders is
such a hot idea after all.
