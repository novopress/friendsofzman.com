As we head into the last semi-official week of summer, at least here in
America, I wanted to keep it light this week. I had something else in
mind, but I realized I was taking next week off and not feeling very
serious as a result. I bet a lot of people are in the same place, as the
summer winds down. Here in Lagos, the schools start the day after Labor
Day this year, so next week is a big vacation week. Parents are prepping
for school and non-parents are enjoying family free time at the beach.

Of course, the end of the summer means the news cycle picks up again.
The FBI document dump appears to be queuing up, so that means the Left
will be turning the sewage hose on full blast in order to distract us.
Taking some time off before the lunatics are back at full screech is a
good idea. As we get closer to the 2020 Democrat primaries, the lunacies
is sure to reach levels we never thought possible. I did a little on
this in the show, but I suspect we are in for an interesting autumn.

One of the funny things about doing a lot of traveling in your business
life is that vacation often means no going anywhere. When I was a young
man, vacation meant going somewhere for sun and fun. Years of traveling
and I now look forward to take at least one week a year where I just
stay home. I plan to leave Lagos next spring, so I am looking forward to
a week of cleaning out closets and making trips to the landfill. It’s
not a glamorous way to spend a week, but it beats being in a hotel room.

I’ve also found that the vacation at home is much more relaxing that
taking a trip somewhere. These days, you can never get away from work,
as something always comes up that you have to address. When I’m on a
trip that is always in the back of my mind, especially if I’m in a
different time zone. At home, I just leave the e-mail client up and take
a look from time to time. I don’t feel like I’m missing anything and I
have the peace of mind that I can address anything as it comes up.

Whenever I think about that fact, I wonder how people lived in the age
before constant electronic communications. I would imagine most people
just assumed you could not reach someone on vacation, so they figured it
out on their own. That and there was probably more respect for people’s
time away from the office. Not to sound like a Bolshevik, but the
technological revolution has led to the enslavement of the population in
ways the old Robber Barons never could have imagined.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
