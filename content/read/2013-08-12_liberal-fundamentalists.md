Listening to sports radio this morning, I heard two knuckleheads on a
Boston channel blabber on about about Tim Tebow. They want Tebow cut
from their favorite team and they cannot sleep knowing he may make the
roster. They did not put it that way, but it was obvious. Both jock
sniffers were standard issue lefties that you see throughout the mass
media. These are the type of folks who walk around convinced they are
middle of the road moderates or maybe libertarians, when in reality they
are solidly on the Left.

Anyway, listening to the two idiots rant and rave about Tebow, I was
reminded of something about Liberals I have always found irritating.
That is, they never want to be around contrary opinion. They don’t want
to see it anywhere in their lives. If they are in a group of people that
includes a non-liberal and the conversation turns to politics or current
events, they will walk out of the room. Often they put their hand up in
that  way women do to indicate they don’t want to hear anymore. It’s
like they will melt by hearing bad-think.

In the case of Tim Tebow, his mere presence as an adherent of another
religion so upsets them they demand he be cut from the team. That’s
really what it is with him. He’s a vocal and unabashed Christian. He’s
also very southern, which is a second strike against him in the case of
Boston liberals. For liberals, his very existence is an abomination that
has to be removed from their site. Heck, they would probably be OK with
having him removed from earth. They see him as a mockery of what they
believe to be holy and true.

This is why liberalism needs to be viewed as a religion. It’s got a lot
of similarities to Islam, which is mostly defined by what it opposes.
Muslims are nuts about eradicating non-Muslims from their ranks. It’s
not enough to simply know they are right. They don’t want infidels
anywhere around them. Of course, the Bolsheviks maintained a rigorous
internal exile system to accomplish the same thing. The totalitarian
mind is defined by those borders, as well as their purity. That means
the heretics are either expelled or killed.

That’s the liberal mind and why they hate guys like Tim Tebow.
