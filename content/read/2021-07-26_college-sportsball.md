Last week, the American sporting world was sent into a frenzy over news
that the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma were
planning to leave the Big 12 conference for the Southeastern Conference.
In addition to stripping the Big 12 of its flagship institutions, it
would make the SEC into a juggernaut. They would have half of the dozen
or so major brands in college football. This would no doubt set off a
frenzy of moves by the rest of college football in order to keep pace.

For those outside the United States, college athletics is a big business
and a big part of the sporting tradition in America. It all started
innocently enough when groups of young men at college would challenge
the young men of another college in some sort of athletic competition.
Before long it was formalized and became a part of the identity of the
college, a way for the students and alumni to bond. The colleges found
it was good advertising, so they would offer good players free tuition.

Into the 1980’s college sports, not unlike professional sports, was
mostly the plaything of rich people. Wealthy alumni would give money to
the school so they could build arenas, pay players, and hire top
coaches. To be a top donor to a college was a prestigious thing, so
successful alumni were motivated to give back. Then the world changed in
the 1980’s with the explosion of television. With the spread of cable,
television revenue exploded, and it poured into college sports.

It is fair to say that college sports, particularly college football and
college basketball, shifted from semi-professional and informal to
professional and formal. Prior to the cable age, top coaches made a nice
living, but the rest were paid like any other employee of the
university. Today, top coaches are the highest paid employees on campus,
by a factor of ten. The college athletics department is a 100 million
dollar enterprise with hundreds of staff and players.

College football is the primary driver. Football is the most popular
television sport in America by far. College basketball also plays a
role, but it is primarily football that is driving the economic
revolution in college sports. Unlike the NFL, the fans of college
football have a bond with the players, as the players, in theory, are
attending classes at their school and will be proud alumni one day.
Despite the obvious exceptions, this is true, and the players remain
part of the community forever.

Both college basketball and college football offer good examples of the
dangers of an unregulated marketplace. Into the 1980’s, all college
sports were governed by the NCAA, which tried to maintain college
athletics as amateur endeavors. With the flood of TV money, the power of
the NCAA has declined to the point where they have little say over the
governance of football or basketball. Instead, what has erupted is a
free market free-for-all where the big try to eat the small and even
some of the big.

Prior to the financialization of college sports via the conduit of
television money, college sports were a regional enterprise. Schools
organized locally into conferences, which supplemented the NCAA in
governing the sports and provided local management of the routine items
like scheduling and tournaments. With billions in TV money, these
conferences were not only empowered to break free of NCAA governance,
but they could also go to war with one another in an effort to gain
market share.

Contrary to what libertarians claim, this explosion in competition among
suppliers did not result in lower prices to consumers or great variety
of product, but rather a massive contraction of the marketplace along
with spirally costs to consumers. In the 1980’s colleges gave their
students free tickets. A college football game was a cheap afternoon of
fun for the fans. Today, students pay for seats through their tuition
and the fans often have to donate thousands for the right to buy
tickets.

Further, the sport of college football is contracting. That is the
significance of the latest news about Texas and Oklahoma. The old model
was a conference anchored by a few big brands, like Texas and Oklahoma.
The league shared revenue and cooperated in scheduling and promotion.
The anchor schools got to control the league for allowing the smaller
programs to freeload off their brand a little. That model is collapsing
as the big brands now seek to combine and exclude the smaller schools.

Like the computer business, college football is headed to a world in
which a small number of big names control the market and work to exclude
everyone else from the revenue stream. In the 1980’s there was a dozen
computer makers with different takes on the home computer. Today there
is basically one type of PC. The same happened with mobile phones. The
unregulated technology market collapsed into an oligarchy, and we are
seeing the same thing happen with college athletics.

Something similar happened with boxing in the 1980’s. It used to be that
every large city had weekly boxing shows where up and coming fighters
battled one another for recognition and the dream of a title shot.
Television put boxing on every week as a normal part of its content.
Friday night fights was a thing into the 1970’s, until the cable
television explosion. Within short order, greed and corruption removed
boxing from the public square and now it is barely an afterthought.

This will probably happen with college sports. There are now minor
leagues popping up to pay high school basketball players rather than
have them compete in amateur leagues or go to college. It will soon be
like tennis, in which promising players turn pro once they hit puberty.
Also, like tennis, the interest from the general public will decline. A
few stars will make millions, but [the
rest](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/tennis-players-association.html)
will be used to maintain a system that was busted out by the usual
suspects.

The point of all this is that markets are man-made things. They are not
like mushrooms that spring up wherever man leaves nature alone. In order
for a market to function, each transaction in the market must have a
disinterested third party with the power to enforce both ends of the
transaction. It must also have the power to prevent a monopoly of supply
or demand. Like a sea wall, this governing authority prevents nature
from taking its course and turning the market into an oligarchy.

Boxing never had a governing body to impose order, so it collapsed into
a chaos of greed and corruption. College athletics is going through the
same process and will meet the same end. Without some entity to guard
the interest of the whole, the participants will cannibalize one another
until the system collapses. This is the nature of markets and it is why
markets can only exist when a controlling authority tasked with
preserving the market has the power to impose order on the market
actors.
