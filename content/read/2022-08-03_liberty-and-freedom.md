Feudalism is a term that either brings to mind serfs slaving away on the
land or knights on horseback jousting at tournaments. Neither image has
much to do with the socioeconomic system that grew up after the fall of
the Western Roman empire and carried on into the 18th century. Both the
knight and the serf were real things, but they are not what defined the
feudal order. It is the system in which people of all ranks lived that
defined what we think of as feudalism.

That system was a series of interlocking relationships. It began with
reciprocal relationships between the warrior elite. The leaders of the
various peoples slowly evolved rules for dealing with one another. Over
time those rules extended to the people over whom they ruled. First it
was the vertical relationships and then the horizontal relationships.
Most of these rules were not written down. They were the habit of mind
that everyone understood and accepted.

What we think of as freedom and liberty come from the feudal era. The
two words are used interchangeably today, but it was not always so.
Liberty was the right to act within the context of the rules. Freedom
was a state in which there were no rules. In the feudal age, liberty was
the range of actions for people of a class. Freedman had different
liberties than Knights or serfs. Freedom, on the other hand, was being
free from those reciprocal relationships that defined the system.

One of the interesting things about the feudal order that has been
forgotten is that freedom was a powerful weapon used by kings. Freeing
people from their feudal obligations did not necessarily grant them more
liberties, but it did weaken the power of the people to whom they no
longer had obligations. Freeing the serf from his duties to his lord not
only meant he could sell his labor but it meant that his lord no longer
had control over him or the proceeds of his labor.

In a system where everyone is defined by their relationship with
everyone around them, monarchical power is diffused through the system.
The noble who controlled a portion of the kingdom had a great deal of
power relative to the king, because all of the rights and duties of his
people flowed through him to the king. Once those people were free then
they reported directly to the king. A great irony of the feudal order is
that individual freedom turned out to be the great centralizing force in
politics.

A similar dynamic is at work in this age. As recent as the 1950’s the
primary duty of most men was to their family. From there it was their
community then the larger political entities like city, county and
state. Outside of the draft and the post office, people had no reason to
think about the national government. Go back further and the national
government played little role in the life of Americans. You could live
your life never having had contact with the national government.

As Americans have been freed from the old rules of life, like marriage,
family and community, the power of the government has grown. The
weakening of state and local government by direct intervention by the
federal government has corresponded with the collapse in things like
property rights and freedom of association. Young women are no longer
dependent on a man, but they are entirely dependent on government. It is
impossible to live without interacting with government now.

The conventional conservative critique argues that personal liberty has
declined because the power of the state has increased. In reality,
personally liberty has declined because freedom has increased. As people
have been freed from their particular obligations to one another, their
liberties have declined, which is what has allowed the power of the
federal state to grow. Each new “freedom” comes with less liberty and
therefore a declining ability to resist the state.

In a way, the great progressive reforms of the 20th century were like
the king freeing the people from their feudal obligations. It was first
and foremost about weakening the intermediaries between the central
government and the people. In America this has meant the constriction of
state and municipal power. Griswold v. Connecticut was never about
individual liberty, but about subverting local authority. It was about
breaking those local bonds that preserved individual liberty.

What little liberty remains in modern America appears to most people to
be dependent upon the power of the state. It is a perverse form of slave
logic. The homely women demanding reproductive freedom in the public
square are no different than the slave begging the master for
protection. They are no longer at liberty to make choices within the
range of options available to them, so they demand the all powerful
state provide the freedom they mistake for liberty.

The zenith of every empire features the almost unlimited power of the
person who sits atop the imperial system. The decline of empire always
features an increasingly inability of the sovereign to impose his will.
Factions within his own government collude to undermine his will. New
power centers begin to grow up, operating as choke points between the
empower and his subjects. Like weeds, those old reciprocal relationships
begin to sprout up and eventually overtake the system.

We may be seeing something similar. Corporations now wield more power in
the lives of the people than the federal government. For example, if the
mobile companies wanted, they could have stonewalled the FBI with
regards to the J6 protests. Their swift action in identifying the people
in the capitol was a power move. When the federal government needs help
dealing with internal threats, they now ask politely for help from their
partners in the private sector.

We are also seeing a resurgence of state power. States shipping migrants
to Washington is a power move. States challenging the power of the
administrative state in the courts is another assault on the king. Of
course, the same managerial mindset that crippled the Trump presidency
is doing the same to Biden. The real power of the federal state, as
expressed through the executive, is waning. Like every empire in
decline, this one is suffering from a growing impotence at the center.

In the transition, both liberty and freedom will decrease. We see it
today with the abuses of individual liberty from all sources of power.
In the long run, the restoration of those old duties and obligations
will restore the balance between the two. Being ruled by a local elite
personalizes the relationship. The people at the top are reminded of
their duties every time they go outside. The people at the bottom have
no illusion about the source of their liberties.
