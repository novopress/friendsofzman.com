I have returned from the land of the perpetual 70’s. Newark is a strange
place, in that it feels like it is trapped in a 1970’s blacksploitation
film. Walking around the city, I saw lots of shucking a jiving. I saw
people dressed like extras from a movie on the great heroin dealers of
the period. Atlantic City has the same vibe. Maybe the 70’s was the peak
for these places, at least for their current demographic, and they still
have a residue of the era hanging over them. I had the theme song to
Shaft in my head for the last week.

This week I wanted to do a show on politics. I have not been doing a lot
of political stuff, so I thought it was a good time to swing back and do
a show in political topics. In Newark, I was around some northeast
Progressives, so hearing them talk about Trump got the juices flowing.
There’s also been a lot of big stuff this week. The Korea summit and the
IG report are a month’s worth of content for each event. Whatever you
want to say about Trump, the guy is a man of action. He’s doing as much
as he can, despite the opposition.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
