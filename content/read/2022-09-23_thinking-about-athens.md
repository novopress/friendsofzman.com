A little change of pace this week as the news is mostly made up nonsense
about the war on Russia and, of course, stories about Trump. The
obsession with Trump moved past whatever lies beyond absurd years ago.
Even if you get the symbolism of Trump to the managerial elite, their
obsessing over him is exhausting. It is as if they want to talk about
him to the point where his fans are sick of the subject.

Scan the millions of posts about Trump in the regime media each week and
it is like watching a man deliberately slip on a banana peel. His
attempt to entertain the audience just creates a sense of shame. You are
embarrassed for him. That is the same feeling I get when I read a New
York Times piece about Trump. How humiliating and degrading it must be
to write those posts.

The Finns have a word for this, myötähäpeä, which roughly translates
into secondhand shame or shared embarrassment. Fremdschämen is the
German version of it, which means the feeling you get when seeing
someone do something so embarrassing that you start to feel shame by
watching it. English does not have a corresponding word, which is odd
given the history of the English language.

If there is no word for it, then it does not exist, at least in the
mental landscape of the people who speak the language. Perhaps if the
English language did have a word for this sensation, we would have fewer
people willing to degrade themselves in public just to get a little
attention. On the other hand, maybe the Germans have so many of these
people they needed a word for it.

Regardless, you have to wonder if by 2024 people will have tired of the
endless drama that surrounds Trump. On the other hand, the elite
obsession with him may turn the man into a martyr. To his credit, he is
still putting his chin out daring them to take their best swing at him.
Like every decision to fire on a crowd of protestors, the eventual
arrest of Trump just feels like it is inevitable.

Anyway, the topic this week is about the dynamics that exists within a
debating society committed to consensus. This is a topic that will be
visited in a different context in the Monday Taki post. The jumping off
point for the discussion is how debate must have worked within Athenian
society. We get to pretend we are wearing our togas and debating the
issues of the day with the ancients.
