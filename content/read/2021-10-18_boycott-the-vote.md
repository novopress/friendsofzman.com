Donald Trump finally got the attention of Republican leaders the other
day when he said that unless they addressed the 2020 election
shenanigans, his supporters will <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-claims-supporters-wont-vote-unless-gop-backs-fraud-theory-2021-10"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">not bother to vote</a> in upcoming
elections. This got the usual suspects out to denounce him as a Hitler
plotting to do Hitler things. Regime media was flooded with boilerplate
articles about how there was no evidence to support his claims. Some
Republicans were sent out to denounce him for his dangerous rhetoric.

This little bit of drama is interesting in that it suggests that some
portion of the electorate is making the next logical step. If you cannot
get what you want at the ballot box, either because the vote is rigged
or the choices are false, then why vote? If those conditions are true,
then voting becomes self-sabotage. When you vote, you are endorsing the
process and its results. Voting in a rigged election is, in effect,
validating the rigged process and the people rigging it.

The fact that it has taken close to a year for anyone to reach this next
logical step in evaluating the last election shows the power of
conditioning. Everyone has been conditioned since childhood to believe
that voting is a requirement of citizenship and not voting is therefore
an abdication of duty. You cannot complain about the system if you do
not participate in the system is the logic of democracy. The only
acceptable participation is voting for one of the two parties.

It is a bizarre logic when you consider it. Popular entertainment is
full of plots where the star is faced with two bad choices and refuses
to accept them. Instead, he creates a third choice to save the day.
Every business school trains students on how to think beyond the choices
on offer. “Thinking outside the box” is considered to be the hallmark of
the modern entrepreneur. People like Elon Musk are celebrated because
they allegedly refuse to accept the conventional answer.

Only in politics is it that no one is ever allowed to question the
options put forward by the two political parties each election. This
exception to the rule of thinking outside the box is necessary because
the system requires it. For example, if “none of the above” was an
option in most elections, that would often be the winner. This is why it
is never an option on the ballot. Otherwise, even the dullest Republican
voter would begin to think that maybe he should have another option.

Of course, one of the weapons that the system has always used to prevent
people from thinking outside the box regarding politics is
hyper-partisanship. “If you don’t vote for more of the same, the other
side will win.” This was the standard line from people like Jonah
Goldberg in the Bush years. Staying home was a vote for the other side,
so you had to hold your nose and vote for the Republicans. It was
effective until 2006 when the odor was so bad that no amount of nose
holding was possible.

The neocons conveniently forgot about that in 2016, but they went to
great effort to avoid saying they would boycott the election. Even they
saw the danger of unleashing that option on the system. Conservative
Inc. was mortally wounded when they could not explain how their boycott
of Trump was not an endorsement of Clinton. They were either voting for
what they said was evil or they were boycotting the election, something
they said was morally unacceptable.

That last bit has always been a lie. Boycotting elections has been a
part of democratic systems since forever. During the Cold War, the
United States government would encourage boycotts in places being
subverted by communists. Alternatively, the protest vote has always been
a part of the American system. Organizing people to throw their vote
away on a ridiculous option is just another form of boycott. You are
forcing onto the ballot the words “none of the above”.

Getting back to Trump and his boycott claim, he was never more than a
wrecker, which is what the times require. He will never organize a
boycott or even completely endorse such a campaign. He will talk about
it. For good or ill, if he talks about something it becomes news. Just
mentioning the idea of boycotting the midterm is more than enough to
normalize the idea for unhappy voters. Sitting out, perhaps loudly
sitting out the election, becomes the best way to participate.

If you look at the upcoming midterm, there are maybe 25 seats that are
genuinely up for grabs with another 25 that might tip that way. The
Democrats currently hold 220 seats and the Republicans 212 seats. The
seats that will decide the House will be won with just over 50% of the
vote in those districts. In other words, even a poorly organized boycott
could prevent the Republicans from getting the House. It is a low cost,
high reward strategy to send a message.

Now, even a highly organized national boycott of the midterms, where
Democrat voters join in will change little in terms of policy. The
people who control the two parties will remain in control. What changes
is public perception of politics. This system requires the broad public
to think voting matters. If they come to see that voting is just
ceremonial, a play put on to keep them pacified, then the system cracks.
At the minimum, it brings the system to crisis.

There are no easy answers to generational problems, but normalizing the
idea of a boycott helps create a morality outside the prevailing
orthodoxy. If 20% of people think that boycotting the system is the
moral choice, they are in effect rejecting the morality of the
established order. It is a peaceful revolt. Once people get used to
revolting in their minds, they can revolt against the system.
Normalizing the revolt of the mind is a prerequisite for any challenge
to the prevailing order.
