It was my plan to do one of these on a monthly basis like other sites,
but time gets away from me and I forget to do it. I think the last one
of these was in the summer, but I’m too lazy to look. It was well before
the election so I’m guessing summer. Most sites seem to do these monthly
to go along with fund raising, which makes sense. If you are asking for
money, providing readers with some idea of what they are supporting is a
good idea. Anyway, with the election over it feels like a good time to
do it.

There are many new readers and new commenters since the last time.
According to the traffic stat gizmo, my estimated readership is just shy
of 80,000. That’s close to double in the last few months. It has been a
steady rise too so it is not as much of an election effect as I would
have guessed. Then again, I did not do a ton of stuff on the election.
This also corresponds with the growth of my twitter and Gab accounts.
I’m an infrequent tweeter, but I do link my posts there so it is mostly
organic growth.

Speaking of twitter and Gab, JohnRivers, who comments here from time to
time, promotes wackos like myself regularly on twitter and he has a big
following. Well, *had* a big following. They whacked him this week as
Twitter purges all the icky mean speakers in order to make twitter a
safe space for snowflakes. Gab is getting better and better and I highly
recommend joining and following
<a href="https://gab.ai/JohnRivers" target="_blank">JohnRivers</a>.
Following
<a href="https://gab.ai/Ricky_Vaughn99" target="_blank">RickyVaughn</a>
is a must, mostly because the kid is hilarious when he starts in on a
gentle little snowflake.

Interestingly, the number one way in which people are coming here is
Google. I guess people see links on twitter or Facebook, google the blog
and then land here. These are direct hits on posts too. Facebook is the
second most popular referrer, which means someone is linking my stuff
there. I have a Facebook page, but only so the little buttons at the top
of posts work. I never go on Facebook and I have not visited my page
since I setup the account. In fact, I may not have logged on since I set
it up.

Interestingly the most popular post remains
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=7447" target="_blank">this
one</a>, which says a lot about the number of alt-right and alt-right
sympathizers. The next most popular post is
<a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=8880" target="_blank">this
one</a> and that says a lot about what was on the minds of sympathizers
in the run up to the election. I’ve always suspected that some portion
of the electorate looked at Clinton and wondered if the woman was not so
much corrupt, but just not very bright. The crooks and grifters
surrounding her saw an easy mark with access to power. I don’t know and
I no longer care. The witch is dead.

The volume of comments has gone up and and we have new faces since the
summer. More than a few times I have seen posts on twitter about the
quality of the comments here. In fact, one of my twitter followers says
the comments are often better than the blog posts. I do not take that as
an insult. Another follower told me that my comment section is a bit
intimidating. I’m not entirely sure I follow, but I suppose some people
refrain from commenting when they see a regular that is on top of his or
her game.

I’ve received inquiries about donations and I have no plans to do
anything on that front. I like money as much as the next guy, but
there’s a level of effort involved with setting up donations and I don’t
have the time. If I was looking to make this a full-time paying job then
it would be different, but that’s not the plan. That’s mostly because I
don’t see how anyone makes a living as a blogger. Honestly, I always
wonder how people like Steve Sailer and Stacy McCain make it work.
There’s a bit of economics there that eludes me.

My hate mail has gone up as well. Before the election, I was getting a
regular stream of claims that my sort was finished. The right side of
history was coming for me. After the election, not so much. In the last
few days the hate mail has mentioned Steve Sailer and Steve Bannon. I
read the former and never heard of the latter until this week. I see
there’s some sort of <a
href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/glenn-beck-explains-to-anderson-cooper-the-shadowy-sinister-steve-bannon-steve-sailer/"
target="_blank">conspiracy theory involving the two being peddled
by that crackpot Glenn Beck</a>. I must be stepping up in the world. I
welcome my inclusion in the conspiracy.

That’s it for this update. I thank everyone for reading, linking and
mentioning the site.
