This is the Fourth of July weekend, the high point of the summer and
theoretically the most America holiday of the year. Thanksgiving is
probably the most American holiday, but the usual suspects have been
gnawing away at it. July 4th is expressly a holiday for celebrating what
it means to be American. It is the one day of the year when normal
people are allowed to be nationalistic and patriotic. You are even
allowed to say nice things about the white people who founded the
country.

It is hard to know, but it seems that patriotism is on the wane. The
days of retail shops decorating themselves with red, white and blue
colors are gone. They no longer run sales around the holiday. The media
seems to be ignoring the holiday this year, despite the fact their cult
controls the formal government. Back in the Obama years they took this
time to tell us that the strange man with the Muslim name was actually
Abraham Lincoln reincarnated. This year it is silence.

Back in the Bush years, white people were super-patriotic. The crusade
against Islam was the main reason. After the end of the Cold War, white
people were desperate for an enemy and the usual suspects were happy to
oblige. That may have been when patriotism started to decline. By the
end of the Bush years many people thought their civic nationalism had
been exploited for illicit purposes. The last twenty years have largely
confirmed those suspicions.

Of course, patriotism has always been a white thing. Black people are
the least patriotic for obvious reasons. The origin story of black
people is probably enough to prevent great loyalty to the country. There
is no getting around the fact that blacks were brought here against
their will. Even though Africans in America live like kings relative to
Africans in Africa, the resentment is part of black identity. Therefore,
the decline in patriotism is all about white people.

The steady decline in white patriotism can also be rooted in the
antiwhite pogroms that have become a feature of America. Every ad maker
complies with the edict to erase all white faces from their ads. The
exception is the race mixing ads and when they use a white man as an
object of ridicule. Movies and television shows have not gone quite so
far, but the antiwhite messaging is still there. Of course, politics is
drenched in antiwhite rhetoric from the Left with conservatives nodding
along.

It is a weird thing to see the regime demanding everyone accept high
food and fuel prices as the price to pay for democracy. The implication
is that paying the price for bad policy decisions is our patriotic duty.
White people can be forgiven for thinking this is just a joke at our
expense. The regime is laughing at us. Why would white people make any
sacrifices to a regime that calls us evil? Why would anyone be loyal to
a system that has produced this corrupt regime?

According to a recent <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/poll-americans-guns-against-government"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">poll</a>, most people think the
government is corrupt and a quarter are open to an armed revolt.
Interestingly, the reason for this is in the text of that Guardian
story. “This deadly attack on the US Capitol stemmed from the false,
partisan, pro-Donald Trump belief that Joe Biden did not win the 2020
election. Rioters attempted to thwart certification of the election, in
an effort to keep Trump in office.” This degree of lying naturally makes
people want to revolt.

This raises the question as to whether patriotism is possible in this
age. Back in the Bush years the media was biased against “conservatives”
so naturally “conservatives” were patriotic as a way to oppose the
liberal media. There seemed to be a line between the media and the
political class, even if the media favored one side. Now only a
simpleton thinks the media is anything but the voice of the ruling
class. As a result, we are constantly reminded of their corruption.

If it is no longer possible for a rational person to feel any loyalty to
the nation, then what will hold the country together? In the book *After
Nationalism: Being American in an Age of Division*, Samuel Goldman looks
for a new way to unify the nation. Here is a good <a
href="https://chroniclesmagazine.org/recent-features/a-history-of-american-identities/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">summary</a> from Chronicles. Goldman
describes the three prior unifying identities as the covenant, the
crucible and the creed. These were the large frameworks in which
patriotic loyalty was cultivated.

There is plenty to dispute in that description, but what the Chronicles
review makes clear is that there is no obvious fourth option. The only
way to arrive at something close to a civil society again is by first
removing the people in charge of the political and cultural
institutions. The crazies currently in charge are not going to be talked
out of their positions and they are not going to sacrifice themselves
for the common good, so that means physically removing them from power.

This is why the regime is so desperate to break up anything that looks
like self-organizing by normal people. They understand better than most
Americans that the only thing preventing a revolt is confusion in the
masses. It is why they remain haunted by the January 6th events. Their
determination to put Trump in jail is viewed by them as a matter of
self-preservation. It is why the
<a href="https://unherd.com/2022/06/the-rise-of-christian-nationalism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">bigots</a> have been enlisted to start
attacking Christians who question the regime.

The fact is, the system holds together only if the majority population
has no sense of identity at all. Patriotism focuses too much attention
on the institutions and the people running them, so that cannot be
allowed. Regional, religious or racial identity, at least among the
majority population, is dangerous, so it is forbidden. The nature of
minority rule is that it must make sure the majority never agrees on
anything. Division is now the new creed of the American empire.
