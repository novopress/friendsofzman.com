The GameStop story, which is becoming more of a general short squeeze
story, is a good example of what happens when an economy is fully
financialized. Since there is little money to be made in making things
or creating things, the best human resources flow into finance, where a
bright person can get rich finding a slight imbalance in the marketplace
for an asset or an error in the holdings of another player. The economy
becomes a massive poker tournament with the central bank as the house.

If you step back and think about the transaction at the heart of this
story, there is no moral or economic reason for it to exist. The
practice of shorting a stock can have both moral and economic utility.
In the former case, an investor seeing some corruption in a company or
sector is letting the world know about it by betting against it with his
own money. On the latter point, the blend of shorts and longs provides
useful data about stocks and sectors for investors and planners.

When everyone at the table is using chips borrowed from the house and
many of the whales at the table will never have to repay the house, both
of these functions are flipped on their head. In the case of GameStop,
some sharps were gaming the system in an effort to artificially deflate
the value of otherwise good companies. GameStop is a solid little
company that is an example of modern retail. They are a value-added
retailer, which is the future in the world of digital commerce.

The point of the shorting activity was not to reveal some flaw in the
company’s approach or signal a lack of faith in the retail sector. The
point of the trade was to fool other investors into piling in on the
short, so the price of the stock would collapse. This would allow the
hedge funds behind this scheme to make a quick profit. The losers in
this will be the people holding the stock and the company itself. Like
all victims of piracy, their only crime was in trusting the system.

The neoliberal defenders of financialization will counter that the
WallStreetBets activity is exactly the sort of self-regulation imagined
when the process of financialization began in the 1980’s. Instead of
government bureaucrats with no understanding of the market picking
winners and losers, savvy players would do battle in the marketplace. In
this case, clever traders saw an opportunity to raid the pirate ships
raiding companies like GameStop and they carried off some booty for
themselves.

This sounds great, if you are a pirate. There is no doubt that the
people involved here love the action in the same way gamblers love it
when some guy is on a huge roll at the craps table. It is an
exhilarating drama, even for the observers. The thing is most people are
not pirates and have no interest in being pirates. More important, they
do not wish to be ruled by pirates. They do not want to live in a world
of no fixed rules, just the shifting standards of the pirates making war
in the economy.

This brings us to the purpose of having markets and rules to govern
trade between people within a society. In order to have a society with
any chance of survival, you have to have rules governing exchange
between members. Otherwise, your society is a war of all against all.
This opens the prospect of outsiders exploiting these constant divisions
in order to conquer or destroy your society. Obviously, you want to
prevent this, so the rules are designed to reduce division.

Put another way, economics is a tool. That tool is used to bind the
people closer together, by rewarding the things that promote the common
good and punishing those things that harm the common good. Inevitably,
they help the society to strengthen itself against other societies. Just
as males compete with one another for mates, societies compete with one
another for resources and status. One is linked to the other as an
immutable part of the human condition.

Neoliberalism reverses the relationship between society and economics.
Instead of society wielding economics as a tool, pirates pick up parts
of society and swing them around like flails at one another. In this
example, a little company that probably should be private, is seeing its
share prices stuffed into the cannons of financial pirates and fired at
the ships of other pirates. When it is all over, the pirates will sail
away to the next skirmish, while a little company lies in ruins.

This type of economics is inherently unstable. For one thing, the
pirates must always be looking for new raiding opportunities. This is
why the United States, the pirate’s cover of globalism, is always
belching out raiding parties around the world. The quest for new plunder
is insatiable. The constant war with Russia, for example, is over the
pirate’s desire to financialize the vast natural resources of Russia.
The Middle East is chaos, in part, because it is endlessly plundered by
pirates.

More important from the perspective of the West, financialization
undermines the institutions, because they become partners in the endless
raiding. Instead of being the source of stability in a society, they are
seen as aiding and abetting the pirates endlessly plundering the
economy. Look around the West and the one universal thread is the public
no longer trusts or respects its institutions. The people inside the
institutions look out seeing nothing but sails on the horizon.

The age of pirates ended when the British government decided it was no
longer in their interests to promote it. The British navy went out and
sank pirate ships where they found them, and pirates were hung when they
were caught. Eventually, order was restored to sea commerce. The modern
world lacks an authority with the will and ability to bring the pirates
under control. The public, on the other hand, demands such an authority,
so eventually, they will find one or create one.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
