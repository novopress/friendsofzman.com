For most people, travel has always been looked upon as the necessary
evil, a thing you get through in order to get somewhere. That week on
the beach in Florida during the winter means a day of torment at
airports to get there. The trip back is extra miserable because you are
tired from having fun all week. Experienced travelers, on the other
hand, figure out the system and it becomes a habit of mind. You know how
it works so you know how to make it work for you.

Before Covid, the thing I could see was that the system was simply
overloaded at various key points. The security system, for example, had
broken down. At some airports you would wait over an hour for totally
disinterested TSA workers to process you through the system. In Europe,
you would hustle from line to line to clear passport control, when the
only actual check was a zombified worker looking at the millionth
passport that day and waving you along.

Covid cured that by first reducing travel to the absolute minimum and
then conditioning people to not want to travel. An overlooked result of
the almost two years of stay at home orders is people got used to
staying home. In overgrown metro areas like Washington DC, working at
home is common. Business travel never bounced back because everyone is
used to Zoom sessions now. Now, economic concerns have put a damper on
the travel business.

You see this at airports. I have been on the road a a fair bit this year
and the one thing I keep seeing is light traffic at airports. There are
fewer flights, so they are just as full, but the number of people in the
concourse is still below the pre-Covid days. The travel industry claims
things are bouncing back, but they lie like everyone else these days, so
I trust my lying eyes rather than their lying mouths. This year on my
travels I have not run into the volume issues anywhere in the system.

I just returned from Nashville, which is a sprawling metropolis full of
strangers from other stranger lands. That is a recipe for a mobbed
airport before a holiday. In the old days, the Sunday before
Thanksgiving would have been nuts and got increasingly nuts through the
week. The reason is all of the newly arrived mountain folk would have
headed back to where they belong for the long holiday. Instead, the
airport was as quiet as I have seen an airport in ages.

On the other hand, something else is happening. At BWI on Friday I tried
to buy a beverage at one of the shops and the non-English speaking clerk
just said something that sounded like “no work” to people. The payment
system was down, as best I could tell, so she was left to chase away
customers. I was reminded of the scene from the movie Idiocracy where
the heroes arrive at Costco. The great thing about that
[scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdNmOOq6T8Y) is you realize the
system can stagger on a long time.

On the plane, one of the flight crew sounded like a satirical version of
how a waifu would sound if it came to life. The other was a local girl,
for sure. Her accent and heavy use of local slang was oddly amusing.
There was a third person on the crew who was the greeter at Costco in
the above clip. I got the sense that he was in training, but it could
simply be that he was not allowed to work unsupervised. He liked tossing
packs of snacks at people from a few rows distance.

At Nashville, the crew at the Alamo rental counter was another
collection of extras from that frighteningly prophetic movie. There was
no line but a mass of people waiting, so I knew right away they were out
of cars. The three clerks just stared out into space like they had been
smoking weed prior to my arrival. Finally, one acknowledged my existence
and waved me over to his station. He silently processed my order and
then grunted about the wait and pointed to the mob.

Ninety minutes latter I was handed a rental agreement by another silent
type who pointed to the door. He was a tall white guy so I think he was
American, but I never saw him speak to anyone, including the weed
smoking fellow clerks, so maybe he was a mute or possible an automaton
from Europe. They have those now. I then headed through the garage to
the rental car area where there was another mob of people waiting for
their rental car to arrive.

The local attendant was a black guy and judging by his accent I deduced
he was a local guy, rather than an automaton from the very southern
Europe area. He realized that his company was screwing these people, so
he tried to make up for it by being extra nice and apologetic,
suggesting he had a soul and cared about his work. It turns out that the
main delayed was they were out of car washers. That was the bottleneck
in the system and he said it has been a problem for weeks.

Now, I could see the check in lane. I could see at least a half dozen
Alamo workers there doing nothing as there were no cars to check in.
Sunday morning is when lots of cars arrive, but Sunday afternoon is when
the cars leave for the week. There were, of course, the crew of zombies
at the rental counter. No where did I see anyone that would be in charge
of anything. What I was experiencing was systemic break down due to a
collapse of the smart fraction in the system.

On the return trip I got to the airport quite early. I had booked extra
time in the trip back because of what I saw Friday. I was imagining the
Alamo crew running TSA and me missing my flight because of a three hour
line. Instead, the airport was weirdly quiet, even for a Sunday morning.
Having extra time, I asked the Southwest person if I could change to an
earlier flight. I had checked on my phone and saw a flight I could get
on that arrived in Lagos much earlier than my current flight.

She silently took my ID and stared at the screen for an uncomfortably
long time, which did not fill me with confidence. She then said the only
thing she could do was put me on standby, so I said no and expected to
get my ID back. Instead, she said to me that I was no longer on my
original flight. After some back and forth, I learned that she had
cancelled my original flight first and then tried to book me on the new
flight, without bothering to tell me what she was doing.

What I realized was the woman was not malicious or disinterested, but
that she was simply too stupid to perform her job. She was clearly
panicked by what she had done as she now had an angry customer in front
of her. Since I have a million points with Southwest and belong to their
club, I called customer service while standing in front of the woman and
explained the deal. They had me hand my phone to the woman who then
followed instructions to fix my flight.

I was now booked on the earlier flight and pre-boarded. Because I only
use Southwest for domestic travel, I always get the A-group and usually
top-10. On this flight I had been checked in as A1, so I guess they
thought bumping me up to pre-board was the required compensation for the
screwup. I could not help but notice that they then announced that the
flight was overbooked and one person would be asked to give up his seat
in exchange for a $500 credit.

In Lagos, I learned that my bag had been sent on a separate journey. I
expected this given what had happened at the other end. I went to the
baggage claim office and was greeted by a local girl listening to very
loud hip-hop music. She silently tapped on the screen for twenty minutes
and out popped a single sheet of paper with about fifty words of
original content. That is right. She needed twenty minutes of
concentration to enter my information into the system.

Like everywhere in the system, the thing I noticed was not the low
quality of human capital at the front end. That has not changed all that
much. Most frontline jobs at an airport are filled with people who show
up. The real issue was a near total lack of supervision all along the
way. There was no one riding heard on these people to make sure they
avoided error. The 21st century has begun and the evolutionary process
has changed and is going in the [opposite
direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP2tUW0HDHA).
