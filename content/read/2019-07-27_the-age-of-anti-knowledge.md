One of the funny things about this age is how the political poles seem
to be swapping positions on a great many issues. The Right, for example,
is now more concerned with the plight of the working man than the Left,
while the Left is a fanatical defender of global capitalism. If 1980 man
were transported to the present, he could be forgiven for thinking
Tucker Carlson is a liberal. He uses the kind of language that was
common on the Left in response to the rise of conservatism.

That does not mean Tucker is a liberal. It just means what we understand
to be Left and Right are not fixed, timeless positions. They are just
words used for “us” and “them” in the game of politics. Conservatism,
properly understood, was always skeptical of capitalism, because it
tended to destroy indiscriminately. Bulldozing a church to build a
processing center may be a more efficient use of resources, but
conservatives always knew the altar was the keystone of civilization,
not the factory.

As is always the case, the Left has the ability to create and define its
opponents, because it controls the institutions. Forty years ago it
created the image of a conservative as a ruthless, cold-hearted
capitalist, in order to have an enemy they could more easily manipulate.
They never cared about the poor or the working classes and never opposed
rule by corporation. The Left in America is an effort to explain why
inequality prevails despite the fact man is born equal.

Thinking of the American Left, at least the old Protestant aspects of
it, as a theodicy, is a good way to understand why the people who used
to sport Darwin fish on their Volvo are now extreme science deniers. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Sailer</a> has been
following the new star on the denialist scene, Angela Saini, who is
getting famous waging jihad against observable reality. Her
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02244-w"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest fatwa</a> has been
published on the site called Nature, which is ironic, given the article
is a rebuke of nature.

Saini is not the only primitive showing up in the prestige press,
shaking her staff at the heavens, demanding the gods conform to her
dictates. Cordelia Fine was the toast of the town a couple years ago,
when she published a book claiming reality is a magic trick played on us
by hobgoblins. She did not put it that way. Her case was actually much
weaker and less coherent.
<a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/old-t-rex/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greg Cochran’s review</a> of
her book reads like someone correcting a child or possibly a simpleton.

Of course, the over-the-top science denialism we see in the prestige
press is filtering down to the rest of the cult. They don’t bother with
the arguments, instead preferring to repeat the catch phrases. The
extremely long-winded YouTuber, Alt-Hype,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1rbIYwK4A"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reviewed</a> a chubby
left-wing incel, who is making a name for himself as a science denier.
JF Gariepy has a
<a href="https://youtu.be/43EEL2iaw-Q?t=3569" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">shorter version</a>. The even shorter version is the
lefty incels are now denying the very basics of biology.

If you are over the age of forty, this is quite a development. Within
living memory, to be a Progressive meant mocking religious people of all
types, but especially Evangelicals, as science denying primitives. The
Left waved around evolution like a magic talisman, dismissing any
argument they deemed religious, by which they meant cultural. Even Obama
mocked Christians this way when he was running in 2008. Progressives
bleeping loved science, while their enemies loved magic.

The change in tone and language among some right-wingers, like Tucker
Carlson, is a bit jarring, but once you get past the superficial, it
makes sense. In the 1980’s, a right-wing regard for the public good
would not have focused on things like affordable family formation or
wage stagnation in the heartland. The excesses of cosmopolitan globalism
would not have entered their minds, because those things did not exist.
It took time and hard experience to learn that Pat Buchanan was right
after all.

What’s happening with the Left seems to be different. It is not an
adjustment to new information or a changing culture. For a very long
time, the human sciences understood that the variety we see in the human
family is rooted in nature. Even those who dispute the validity of
evolutionary biology on religious grounds, fully acknowledged that God
does not distribute his gifts equally. The Left argued that these
difference could be mitigated through public policy and cultural change.

That’s no longer the case. What the Left is engaged in now is a
full-throated rejection of observable reality on moral grounds. Angela
Saini commands that you accept that Kenyan performance in distance
running is an optical illusion. Cordelia Fine, says, as a women, she
knows sex is a social construct, created by men. This is not an
inability to grasp the material. It is a conscious desire to forbid
certain knowledge, to anathematize noticing the world and the
explanations for what we see.

It is popular to talk about this phenomenon in terms of Galileo. The
left-wing science deniers are playing the antagonist role of the Church
and the humans sciences are in the protagonist role. This is probably
comforting to the empirically minded, as it suggests they will
eventually triumph in the end. Not only is this a faulty reading of
history, particularly the Church, it assumes that human progress is
inevitable. That no matter what they do, the march of science will
continue unabated.

Instead, what we are seeing could be the signal of a coming dark age.
Maybe this is what it was like in 1177 BC. The slow decline in general
intelligence leads to a period of anti-knowledge, where knowing how
stuff works, or even being curious about it, is seen as a threat to the
established order. The brakes are applied and progress is reversed until
the point where the people are no longer able to operate the mechanisms
of society created by their ancestors.
