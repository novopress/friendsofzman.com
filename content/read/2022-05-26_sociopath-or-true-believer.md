Outside of the progressive hive, there has been a long running debate,
going back to the 1980’s, about the awareness of the people in the hive.
Left-wing people say things that are clearly not true, but they seem to
believe what they are saying. They have some of the facts and seem to
grasp certain concepts, but they come to conclusions that are obviously
false. The question is whether the people in the hive really believe
what they say or do they know the truth?

The default assumption, popular with mainstream conservatives, is that
progressives are well-intentioned, but wrong on the facts. These are
reasonable people who can come to the right answer if you slowly explain
it to them. Conservatives have built their entire movement around the
assumption that there is some way to explain things to the Left that
will trigger a revelation. They will see their error, throw down their
weapons and embrace the conservatives as brothers.

Along with conservatism, this view is fading from the scene. It is a
generational thing as conservatism and most conservatives were formed in
the post-war period. Most people have now concluded that the Left knows
they are lying, but they are consumed with partisanship, so they are
fine with lying. Far-left cranks will claim men can get pregnant because
it advances their interests. The blank slate is central to their
program, so they defend nutty ideas like the trans business.

In a way, this is a coping strategy for conservatives. They cannot
accept that there are people not driven by facts and reason. To do so
would mean the whole facts and reason approach is a waste of time. If
the hive is immune to reason, then there is no point in reasoning with
them and therefore no need for conservatives. Instead, they fall back on
the mendacity claim. That way, if they can expose the lie, the liars
will have not choice but to admit the lie and receive the truth.

There is no doubt that self-interest drives mendacity in politics, but
this only works at the personal or small group level. Politicians lie
for personal advantage. Their staff and allies will join them in the lie
if it benefits them. It was clear that Jen Psaki knew she was lying and
she knew everyone knew she was lying. It was her job and the path to a
television job where she would make big money. This is how things work
in entertainment and politics and everyone knows it.

The behavior of the hive, in contrast, is not for petty advantage. It
looks more like a religious duty. People in the hive now declare their
pronouns and claim people are assigned sex at birth as an act of faith.
The motivation to put pronouns in an e-mail signature is no different
than the motivation to wear a crucifix. It is way to signal your
membership in a religion. In fact, religions have often required these
displays as a way to separate the faithful from the rest.

<a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/dog-breed-personality-characteristics/629707/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of how this works.
This article in the Atlantic is about how dog breeds are a social
construct. It is based in a shoddy bit of social science that was
concocted to address the dog breed line used by people who question the
blank slate arguments of the hive. Dog breeds are used by critics of the
hive as a proxy for the human family and human diversity. Just as there
are different breeds of dogs, there are different breeds of humans with
different characteristics.

The first thing to note is that this was an organized effort. On the
same day, the Washington Post had the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/04/28/dog-breed-behavior/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">same story</a> about the dog breed study.
This was then picked up by small sites that republished it. That is how
it works in the hive. The second thing to note is the Atlantic writer is
someone with impressive academic
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherinejwu" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">credentials</a>. Mx. Wu has a PhD in microbiology from
Harvard. She did her undergraduate and masters at Stanford. Box ticking
aside, those are impressive credentials.

Despite those credentials she has never worked in the human sciences.
Instead, she has been a small time contributor to on-line sites. Her
role here is to give the fake study legitimacy by having someone with
credentials endorse the study. This is what the lawyers would call *mens
rea*. The rollout of this fake study says they know they are promoting a
fraud. They selected the sites and authors in order to best promote what
they know is not true.

On the other hand, where is the personal advantage? The problem with the
conscious mendacity angle is there is no personal advantage for the
people involved. It is not as if Mx. Wu gains something from this. It
will not boost her career in science, assuming she wants a career in the
human sciences. The Post used a random dingbat on the staff for their
version of the story. Instead, Mx. Wu is selflessly sacrificing her
credibility to show her commitment to the progressive faith.

The camp that argues that self-interest is what motivates these will
point out that Mx. Wu could be working from self-interest. People with
her credentials who promote crackpot ideas like the blank slate are
quickly elevated in the hive. Credentials count for a lot with the Left.
If a credentialed person says the moon is made of cheese, the faithful
will believe it. Therefore, Mx. Wu is simply gaming the system in the
hope of being quickly elevated to high status in the hive.

That brings as back to where we started. It is clear from examples like
Mx. Wu that there can be no reasoning with these people. A woman with
her training should see right through that study. She chooses to promote
it, ether because she is a sociopath or she is a true believer. In
either case, facts and reason will have no purchase on her mind or the
minds of the people like her. What motivates members of the hive is
either sociopathy or faith, neither of which yields to reason.
