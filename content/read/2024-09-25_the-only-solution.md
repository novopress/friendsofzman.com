Yesterday the state of Missouri executed convicted murderer Marcellus
Williams after a quarter century of legal wrangling. The case gained
some attention because the defense managed to muddy the waters on the
DNA evidence and therefore drag out the process long enough to get some
of the principles to change their opinions on whether Williams did the
crime. Of course, the real reason it gained attention was that the
killer was black, and his victim was white.

The subtext to crime in current year America is that on the one hand,
blacks commit crime due to living in a white supremacist society. On the
other hand, when blacks commit crimes against whites, the whites must
deserve it for perpetuating the white supremacist society that causes
black crime. This is what makes up the social vengeance subculture at
the heart of the social justice movement. In the end, it is all about
getting revenge on white people.

The result of this or maybe the cause, it is not easy to know at this
point, is that whites often appear to worship black people or at least
want the world to think they hold blacks up as gods among men. The <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/us/marcellus-williams-scheduled-execution-date/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">three dumbest members</a> of the Supreme
Court made sure the media knew they were opposed to the execution. As
part of what we call the left in America, they need to let the rest of
the hive know where they stand on every issue that involves race,
especially when a black is involved.

Putting aside the racial stuff for a second, the case is a good example
of the disfunction in modern America. The point of the death penalty is
to exact revenge, on behalf of society, on the person who committed the
crime. If it takes a quarter century to get that revenge and, in the
process, the worst people are able to gnaw away at the justification for
that revenge, then the point of the execution collapses. This is a basic
function of human society, and we can no longer perform it.

The main argument against execution has always been that it is
theoretically possible to convict an innocent man, so it is possible to
execute an innocent man. This is why it takes decades in many cases to
get to the vengeance part. Every conceivable question is addressed, even
frivolous questions designed to stall the process. The point of the
death penalty now is to make sure that there can be no possible chance
that the person convicted of the crime is not guilty.

Even so, there are examples where there is some questions about the
guilt of the person who was executed. Ironically, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">best example</a> is Cameron Todd
Willingham, who was executed for the killing of his three daughters in a
house fire he was convicted of starting. Otherwise, the examples used
for this argument are those who were eventually exonerated. Instead of
proving the point about innocent men getting executed, it shows that it
is close to impossible.

Obviously, this argument against the death penalty only comes into play
when the person facing Old Sparky is black. The Cameron Todd Willingham
case did not get the frumpy Supreme Court justices out in the streets to
tell the world they would have granted a stay of execution. The media
was not interested in his case. It is always cases like the one in
Missouri that get the attention of the people who apparently think black
people are gods who walk amongst us.

This Afro-philia that has become a feature of the culture might seem
like bourgeois degeneracy, but it has had an impact on the death
penalty. According to the
<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-death penalty people</a>, there are
2244 people on death row in America. This is a shockingly low number,
given that we have over 20,000 homicides per year. Of those on death
row, just 41% are black. Even more shocking, 42% are white. Amazingly,
only 14% of death row inmates are classified as Hispanic.

What this tells us is we need to be executing many more black offenders,
to not only get the current numbers in proportion to the well-known
crime figures on murder, but to address the many years of discrimination
against white murderers. Blacks commit far more murder in America than
any other group and this has been true for generations, so they are
grossly under-represented on death row. That under-representation is due
to the general worship of Africans in the culture.

Afro-philia and Leukophobia not only warp the application of the death
penalty in favor of blacks, but it also provides them with many more
appeal options because the black offender draws more support. Black
offenders spend more time, on average, waiting for their execution than
white killers. The official explanation for this is black offenders have
more complex cases, which is another way of saying they get far more
legal help from people exceptionally good at undermining the system.

The Marcellus Williams case is a great example. He murdered Felicia
Picus in her home during a robbery. He stabbed her over forty times with
a kitchen clever, which means he hacked her to death. There was a
mountain of physical evidence and witness testimony that pointed to
Williams as the killer. The usual suspects swept in once he was
convicted to trick people into questioning their own minds, in an effort
to free another black killer from the justice he deserves.

Of course, the response is always the same. Blacks spent yesterday on
Twitter bemoaning the racial inequity of the death penalty. Progressive
whites joined in with their usual public acts of piety. Pointing this
out results in the usual abracadabra words from the usual suspects. It
is all so tiring and underscores the fact that there is no remedy to
this other than peaceful separation. There is no solving the race issue
because Afro-philia and Leukophobia are too powerful.
