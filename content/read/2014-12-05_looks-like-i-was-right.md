Last week <a href="http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=3280" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">I posted something</a> about the University of Virginia
rape “scandal.”  I was not buying it and it now looks like I was right.
Not that anyone should be surprised that I was right. That should be
your default position. I’m a little surprised that I was so incredibly
right. I said it “reads like what liberals imagine happens in the rape
culture of fraternities.” Reality is rarely so neat and tidy like it is
depicted on TV or in pulp fiction aimed at women. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve Sailer</a> did an excellent
literary critique of the story the other day.

Anyway, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">the magazine is now running away from
their story</a>. The fraternity is about release <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">facts that contradict</a> key parts of
the story. Getting details here or there wrong would be one thing, but
we’re now learning that large chunks of the story are complete nonsense.
Apparently, the young girl in question has been massaging this story for
years, embellishing it as she goes, to the point where even her friends
think she is a nut.

I do wonder if this will be a tipping point for this stuff. There’s a
limit to how many times you can cry wolf. When you get highly memorable
whoppers like this and the Duke lacrosse case, they tend to stick in
people’s minds. When the next one comes up it gets easier to recall
these hoaxes. It also makes it easier to recall the lesser hoaxes as
they string together like beads on a string.

Unsaid in all of this is what it means for the Progressive coalition.
The war on women stuff was a huge flop in the election. This stuff does
not help the cause. It just makes appeals to lady part solidarity sound
ridiculous, even to young women. With everyone re-thinking race
relations in light of Ferguson, the progressive coalition is looking
like it is about to collapse. Time will tell, but it looks like the
late-70’s all of a sudden.
