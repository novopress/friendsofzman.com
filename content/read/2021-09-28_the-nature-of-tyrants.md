In the West, the morality of the state has been determined by how much
or how little it respects the basic rights of its citizens. During the
Cold War this was a critical measure used to justify foreign policy. The
American government claimed it was within its rights to overthrow South
American governments that got too chummy with the Soviets because they
would endanger the rights of their people. On the other hand, they would
back anti-communist dictators because they were better than communists.

There was a lot of lying and dissembling on this issue, but the
principle was important to Western governments, so they made a big show
of it. In America, for example, this meant protecting property rights
from the excesses of the state. As a practical matter, it meant the
state had to prove they had good reason for violating your rights before
the court would permit them from doing it. They had to get a warrant,
for example, before tapping your phone or riffling through your papers.

Government is always a blunt instrument and men are not angels so to
avoid office holders and bureaucrats from abusing the rights of the
people they first had to demonstrate there was a compelling government
interest in declaring your backyard a wetland or banning a certain
activity. Put another away, it was the duty of the government to make
the affirmative argument. Citizens did not have to justify their rights
to exercise them. They were assumed.

Property is a useful metric in this regard because it is simple and the
economic basis of Western society. Even in feudalism property rights
were respected, because ownership was what made the system possible. The
right to speak out or organize are up for debate to some degree, but the
right to own the fruits of your labor is the starting point for social
organization in the West. It is what makes communism alien and why it
has always been the domain of outsiders and subversives.

In the United States, property rights barely exist now. [This
story](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-authorities-safety-box-seizures-owners-fight-back)
about the Feds smashing into a private business and taking their stuff
sounds like something from North Korea or maybe Australia. For reasons
they feel no need to explain, they broke into a private bank vault and
stole the property of the customers using the service and refuse to
return the property. By any reasonable moral standard, this is theft and
worse, it is legal plunder. The state is plundering the citizens.

Like all criminals, conmen and sociopaths, the state is throwing up a
dust storm of legal points to distract from the moral point at the
center. In a just society, is it appropriate to take the goods of the
people without first demonstrating that the state has a reason for
seizing that property? The answer is obvious. By Western standards, this
is immoral and the sort of thing that justifies revolution. In fact, it
is this sort of behavior that
[justifies](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)
the very existence of the United States.

This is not an atypical story. The Federal government now routinely
seizes the property of citizens without justification. Nick Fuentes, the
young firebrand nationalist, had his bank accounts seized by the
government. They have not explained why they took his money, and they
refuse to even acknowledge it. One day he had money in his account and
the next day it was cleaned out. The bank finally told him it was the
government, but it took them weeks to get around to telling him.

The general violation of property rights is now the norm. The tech
oligarchs, for example, strongly oppose private property. If they don’t
like what you are saying on your website, they will steal your domain
name. They will collude to limit your ability to hold a job or have a
bank account. What used to be a sacred right of all people is now up for
debate with an unelected oligarchical class as the judge and jury. What
is yours is theirs and what is theirs is theirs and they own everything.

It is tempting to call this feudalism as people have a cartoonish
understanding of the term and the times from which we get the term. The
fact is the typical feudal lord had a greater respect for property
rights than anyone in authority today. The authority of the lord was
rooted in property rights. He respected the rights of small landowners,
because he expected his lord to respect his rights the same way. The
upper cast of modern society has no respect for the people in the least.

This is the critical thing to understand about the modern authoritarian.
They no longer respect what used to be the common morality of the West.
The ultimate constraint on feudal excess was that universally accepted
morality with regards to property, the law and governance. Most people
were illiterate, even the rulers, so the letter of the law was not
paramount. It was the spirit of the law that mattered. In fact, it was
this respect for the spirit of the law on which authority rested.

Today, the people in charge have no respect for the law or the concept
of law, so their agents just do as they please. In fact, they take pride
in trampling the rights of the people, because it pleases their masters.
The goons prosecuting the January 6th protestors, for example, take a
sadistic pleasure in the torment they are inflicting on the people
caught in their trap. Their intentional cruelty has become a positional
good, something that elevates them in the eyes of the oligarchs.

The Declaration of Independence is a remarkable document that is mostly
remembered for the opening lines. Even though those lines have been
abused by the very tyrants that now rule over us, the document is a
remarkable expression of Western thought and Anglo-Saxon morality. After
the long bill of indictment against the king, a list familiar today,
there is this line. “A Prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free
people.”

The beauty of that line is that it qualifies the moral depravity of the
tyrant by juxtaposing it against the nature of a free people. A people
who sit idly by as their rulers trample their ancient rights are getting
the government they deserve. A free people, in contrast,  must hold
their prince to the highest moral standard. It is immoral for them to do
otherwise, as it violates that which defines them as free people. Every
tyrant issues his own death warrant to the free people he seeks to
oppress.
