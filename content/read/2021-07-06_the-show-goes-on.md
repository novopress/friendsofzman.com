One of the weird aspects of liberal democracy is that the state takes
every opportunity to celebrate itself. Every public event has rituals
before the event where members of the state are marched out to be
cheered by the crowd. Sporting events have a weird North Korean vibe to
them. July 4th has always been a chance for the office holders to
celebrate themselves. This year, the F.B.I. decided to <a
href="https://6abc.com/patriot-front-philadelphia-protest-white-supremacist/10858983/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">hold a parade</a> in the city of
Philadelphia to let us know they are always on the job.

Patriot Front is the latest carnival act to get a chance to perform on
the big stage of democracy, at the direction of the usual suspects. They
are based in Texas, but decided to hold a parade in Philadelphia over
the long weekend. Allegedly, they got a permit from the city, but their
event looked ad hoc. They showed up, danced around just long enough to
get media attention and a reaction from locals. Then they got back in
their vehicles and headed for parts unknown.

Some will no doubt say it is unfair to assume these guys are just
another honeypot cooked up by the secret police, but that is the way to
bet these days. The Oath Keepers are looking like they were created by
the secret police a decade ago. This exhaustive <a
href="https://www.revolver.news/2021/06/stewart-rhodes-oath-keepers-missing-link-fbi-unindicted-co-conspirator/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">deep dive</a> by Darren Beatty into the
origins of the group and the dodgy nature of the founder should cause
everyone to rethink the authenticity of these groups. The best you can
say about any of them is they are led by unstable people.

The Oath Keepers are not an outlier. The Proud Boys, which was started
by Gavin McInnes, went from goofy fan club to paramilitary operation.
Instead of drinking beer and celebrating western chauvinism, they were
rolling around in the dirt with Antifa and other state-sponsored
extremist groups. It turns out that the guy who took over the group was
a “<a
href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-proudboys-leader-exclusive/exclusive-proud-boys-leader-was-prolific-informer-for-law-enforcement-idUSKBN29W1PE"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">serial informer</a>” for the secret
police. This is  pattern with these groups that goes back a very long
way. It is the default position.

The essential tool of all secret police operations is to use unstable
informers to infiltrate the target group. The reason this works is
outsider politics tends to attract people just looking for a home, many
of whom are unstable. Go to a Libertarian Party event and it feels like
the day room of a local insane asylum. One of the results is people
organizing outside the system will encounter a lot of crazies. They get
used to seeing them, so the one that is actually an informer slips
through.

A good example of how this works is the Bolsheviks. A fellow named Roman
Malinovsky was a prominent Bolshevik before the revolution. He was also
an agent of the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police. He was able to
become close friends with Lenin and Stalin, two highly paranoid and
suspicious men. Malinovsky even setup Stalin so he could be arrested at
a social event. He was so good at his work that even when everyone was
in jail but him, they still did not think he was a spy.

Malinovsky was always the most enthusiastic supporter of the cause. This
is what won him notice from Bolshevik leaders. He was a guy who never
deviated from the party line, however it was being expressed by the
leaders. It was why Lenin could not accept that he was a spy, even when
the evidence was clear. It is always hard to distrust the guy who is
your most loyal supporter. Eventually he was betrayed by his ex-mistress
and the Bolsheviks had him killed.

Another reason the secret police find it easy to infiltrate outsider
groups, especially those claiming to be on the Right, is that they are
usually run by stupid people who never learn from the past. Look at this
Patriot Front outfit. The “flag and costume” act has been a failure in
America going back to George Lincoln Rockwell. The general public find
it weird and off-putting. The only thing these antics do is isolate the
group from normal society, making them easy targets.

What did the Patriot Front people think they were doing? They already
managed to get themselves put on the terror watchlist. If they were
hoping for attention by the Feds, they need not worry. Was anyone in
Philly going to be impressed with this stunt and say to themselves, “You
know, I think I may consider becoming a fascist”? Was this event going
to bring them positive coverage from the media? As
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPrTSb2TN0c&amp;t=1600s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jason Köhne</a> noted, the only thing it
did was drag young men further into the abyss.

Politics in a liberal democracy is a drama run by the ruling class.
Think of it as a big stage on which politics is acted out for the
masses. In America, this means the Left opens the show by demanding
action against some threat to “our democracy” or demanding action to
defend a victim group. Their fluffers go into the crowd to get the
audience excited for the next drama. The actors perform the familiar
story, sometimes combining the two into a single story.

At this point, the so-called conservatives waddle onto the stage in
their comfort-fit chinos and golf shirts. They dismiss the claims of the
Left, either claiming they are  exaggerating or that the issue is just
not important. The crowd is encouraged to boo and hiss at them, which
causes their knees to shake. Before long, some of them break ranks and
join the Left in jeering at their old colleagues. The crowd keeps booing
and the conservative are eventually run off the stage.

Every once in a while, for reasons science has yet to explain, the
conservatives do not start to shiver and quake. They hold their ground.
This is when the the spotlight illuminates the right side of the stage
and we see the Hitler outfit. Over the sound system comes, “Who in the
crowd will perform this vital role?” Sure enough, some idiot from a
group fond of weird flags runs up on stage, dons the costume and begins
to strut around on stage as the crowd throws rotten vegetables.

This is what the Patriot Front did over the weekend. They also took
credit for defacing the statue of the blessed George Floyd, peace be
upon him. These guys are performing a vital role in the political drama.
This is why the Feds are endlessly trying to coopt and create groups
that will perform this role. It turns out that the supply of idiots
willing to do this without prompting can never meet demand. The secret
police make sure the supply is always there so the show can keep
staggering on.
