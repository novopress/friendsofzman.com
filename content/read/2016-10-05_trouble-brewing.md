One of things you cannot help but notice is that pretty much everything
in America is some sort of scam run by the managerial class to extract
money from the rest of us. The most common way to do this is via cost
shifting and you see it in the so-called non-profit rackets. Everywhere
you look, non-profits are working the tax code so that Cloud People can
live self-actualizing lives, while we get to pay for it. <a

For a long time now, the Federal government has strong armed states into
going along with policies they would never implement on their own. They
do this by threatening to withhold Federal funds for thing like roads
and education. The result is state budgets have swelled as they take on
the burden of the the Progressive fantasies, while the Washington
politicians strut around like heroes for having cooked up these
programs. The states are now running out of money to pay for this crap,
so they are look for new taxes.

Of course, these colleges are working the same rackets. Yale could offer
free tuition to its undergrads. They could expand their undergrad
population and thus reduce tuition costs. Schools like Yale have the
same sized student body they had after WWII, when the country was a
third of its current population. Instead of doing those things, they
have turned Yale into a five star resort whose primary purpose is to be
a money laundering operation for the super-rich, looking to avoid taxes.

All of these cost shifting schemes have something in common and that’s
leverage. State governments have been able to hide the cost of social
programs through debt issuance. Colleges have become luxury resorts by
passing those costs onto graduates in the form of student debt. Young
people are holding north of $1 Trillion in debt at the moment, with
close to 20% of it technically in default. What that is telling us is
that this form of cost shifting is reaching its end as well.

There’s a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Notables#1787_assembly"
target="_blank">Assembly of Notables</a> vibe to stories like this
because what we are seeing is the beneficiaries of the system
desperately trying to keep the plates spinning. The people in power, the
members of both parties, all know that either government spending at all
levels is sharply reduced or that taxes are sharply increased. In all
probability, both will be necessary. The trouble is the people with the
money to be taxed are rich and powerful. Yale does not want to pay taxes
and it does not want its patrons to pay them either.

As was the case in the French Revolution, what we are seeing in America
is the use of debt to perpetuate a system that was evolved for a bygone
era. Social democracy, which is what we have in America, is a 19th
century concept implemented in the 20th century. Big parts of it are no
longer useful, but no one knows how to reform it. There are millions
still making a nice living doing busy work in the system and they will
fight anything that resembles reform. The result is endless haggling
over how to make 2 + 2 = 5.

The most likely outcome of this is we first see state governments begin
to buckle. California is, for all practical purposes, insolvent.
Illinois is probably going to be the first state to face defaulting on
its pension obligations. All but a handful of states are facing very
serious debt problems that will require doing what they previous assumed
was unthinkable, like taxing hospitals and colleges.colleges. Next up
will be a push to get rid of the tax breaks for charitable deductions.
That’s when the whole non-profit racket collapses.

What will be interesting to watch is what happened when the people on
the fringe of the managerial class start to be cut loose to save money.
When hospitals need to cut costs, they will not be laying off nurses and
doctors. They will go for the diversity coordinator and the patient
liaison officer. Colleges are not going to drop the football team, but
they will get rid of the Transgendered Studies people. A whole lot of
people in self-actualizing careers will find out they are luxury items,
not necessities. That’s when things could get fun.
