Form the perspective of human society, there are two types of crises.
The most familiar type of crisis is the unforeseen event that threatens
order. A natural disaster, like an earthquake, is the obvious example.
The ground suddenly begins to shake, buildings fall over and there is
general panic. The people tasked with keeping the wheels of the society
turning have to rush around to put things back in place. This unexpected
event threatens the very order of society.

On the other hand, something like a hurricane or a major snowstorm is an
external threat for which we expect the government to be prepared.
Florida gets enough hurricanes that the people expect the government to
know how to handle them, so if they do not manage the situation
properly, it is a big problem. The elected officials come under pressure
to explain why they screwed up. In other words, their failure to do
their jobs causes a crisis for the political system.

The external crisis is mostly about getting through it as the external
event does not last forever, so once it is done you go back to normal.
The other type of crisis, on the other hand, is the internal one. This
is where some irreconcilable contradiction in the rules of your system
begin to threaten your system. It is not something you can wait out, as
the contradiction is not going away. In fact, its existence becomes a
greater threat each day that it is not resolved or ameliorated.

The Marxists used to talk about the inherent conflicts in capitalism.
They argued that even though capitalism produces great material
abundance, it destroys the social fabric that make it possible. Over
time, the rate of return on capitalism will turn negative and the
abundance will decline. This inevitably leads to social conflict and the
collapse of the system. It was central to Marxism that the inherent
contradictions within capitalism would inevitably lead to crisis.

The thing about a crisis driven by an internal contradiction is that it
forces the people in charge to make a choice that they want to avoid.
The communist ran into this when it became clear that Marxism had no
replacement for price. If they acknowledged this truth, the
justification for their rule evaporated. Alternatively, they could
acknowledge that communism would never produce abundance, but then they
would have to produce another justification for communism.

This
[story](https://au.sports.yahoo.com/brian-flores-sues-nfl-giants-claiming-racial-discrimination-in-hiring-process-211356727.html)
out of the NFL is a great example of the sort of irreconcilable
contradictions that exist in the new social religion of our rulers. The
assumption is that there are not enough black NFL head coaches. No one
says what the number should be, but they all agree the current number is
below the threshold. This is a habit you see everywhere with the new
religion. What is the right amount of diversity? The answer is always
more, but no one can say more than what.

What all of the beautiful people know is that the number of black
coaches is less than the desired number and that is because of racism.
All men are created equal, so what else could explain the disparity in
the profession? Further, most coaches were players and most players are
black. The logic of social Marxism says that the only possible
explanation is some hidden barrier or conspiracy. The reason racial
perfection does not exist is something structural.

That hidden barrier is always structural. The new religion insists that
society is a constructed reality. In this case, as in all cases, white
men constructed the reality, so it must be for the benefit of white men.
That means the system naturally works against black men, which in this
case means hidden or unconscious bias in the hiring of NFL head coaches.
The solution is to compel teams to interview at least two black coaches
as a wrecking ball against the white power structure.

This bit of logic is slamming into the reality of the business. Teams
not only need to win games as a business reality, but they attract
owners and executives who want to win games out of competitive instinct.
This leads to two relevant results. One is they are always looking to
exploit loopholes in the rules to gain an edge. The other is they are
going to hire the coach they think can win. A team will hire a
Volkswagen Beetle full of midget clowns if that means winning games.

Put another way, the inherent contradiction of the new social religion
turns on the fact that the human condition is immutable. They may dream
of a world of perfect equality, but men are not equal in the general
sense or the particular sense. Therefore, human society is going to be
defined by variation and inequality, reflecting the diversity of the
people in that society. In the case of football, most players will be
black, while most coaches will be white.

The crisis is that the true believers think their good intentions put
them on the side of angels, which in this case means the side of
nonwhites. In reality, they are alienating the people they claim to
represent. Imagine being a young black coach hoping for a chance to be a
head coach and quickly learning that your value is in ticking the box on
a form required by the league. Regardless of your views on race
relations, you have to empathize with this coach suing the league.

What the policy does is reveal that you can have a league where everyone
tries to win or you can have a league where everyone tries to comport
with the new racial morality of the new religion. You cannot have both.
That means the owners can choose between wanting to be a hero to the
black man or satisfying the needs of the business. In order to do both,
they need to find a way to crush the dreams of this and other black
coaches in the name of racial equity.

It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at it. The NFL is run by
some of the most disreputable grifters finance capitalism can produce.
The owners are mostly men who gamed the system to skim billions from the
people. They have produced nothing and will leave no footprints when
they are gone. The NFL is the full expression what is wrong with placing
carnies at the top of the social order. No people deserve this misery
more than the NFL owners and operators.

Of course, the NFL is the part of the iceberg we see. They represent the
managerial elite of the American empire. This NFL policy is about
soothing the sensitive psyches of the managerial elite. It is not really
about the black coaches. It is about the elites and their need to
reconcile their position in society. Instead of building monuments to
their people or culture, they are building monuments to themselves by
supporting these reckless social engineering schemes.

It is ironic that the people who come from an intellectual tradition
rooted in the belief that the inherent contradictions of capitalism will
bring down the system and usher in the communist utopia now sit atop a
system riddled with internal contradictions. In the fullness of time,
scholar will debate how it was possible that radial politics could be
wrong about so much and stagger on for so long. The Enlightenment will
inevitably be renamed The Great Embarrassment.
