target="_blank">This is linked to Drudge</a>. It is one of the slide
shows popular for fill space on sites. This one lists the sites top-10
cities in the world. What’s striking about the list is that it is almost
exclusively ultra-white cities. The exceptions are Vancouver (Asian) ,
Toronto (Asian) and  Calgary(Asian). The rest are nearly all European,
with a trivial NAM population. Helsinki just about glows in the dark.
The other feature of the list is the dominance of cities down under.
Australia and New Zealand have tiny NAM populations, trivial in
demographic terms. The people who cooked up this list seem to think
that’s a critical metric for a city.

One of the more hilarious bits is how each city is described in
Wikipedia. Even though most are whiter than a Klan rally, they list
“diversity” at the top of their list of attributes. Yep, they have every
type of white person the world offers. Throw a few Chinese guys in and
that’s the sort of diversity the diversity crowd likes to see. I have a
friend who is a moonbat living in Arlington Mass. That’s a typical
whites-only town in Mass. Very liberal and very white. The guy told me
with a straight face they moved there because of the diversity. He seems
to think the three Indian PhD candidates in the rented house makes the
town into 1930’s Casablanca. Even pointing it out to him, he refuses to
accept it.
