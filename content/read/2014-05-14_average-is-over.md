George Bush was relentlessly mocked for saying he wanted the schools to
ensure that every kid is above average. It was a stupid thing to say,
but people understood what he meant by it. The stupid part is thinking
schools can fix what nature has crafted between the ears of school
children. No one likes to hear that of course. Then again, maybe Bush
was right and everyone can be above average. Most of us think we’re
above average, according to this story in the National Journal.

*Forget being smarter than a fifth-grader. Most Americans think they’re
smarter than everyone else in the country.*

*Fifty-five percent of Americans think that they are smarter than the
average American, according to a new survey by YouGov, a research
organization that uses online polling. In other words, as YouGov
cleverly points out, the average American thinks that he or she is
smarter than the average American.*

*A humble 34 percent of citizens say they are about as smart as everyone
else, while a dispirited 4 percent say they are less intelligent than
most people.*

*Men (24 percent) are more likely than women (15 percent) to say they
are “much more intelligent” than the average American. White people are
more likely to say the same than Hispanic and black people.*

*So, this many smart people must mean that, on the whole, the United
States ranks pretty high in intelligence, right?*

*Not quite. According to the survey, just 44 percent of Americans say
that Americans are “averagely intelligent.” People who make less than
$40,000 a year are much more likely to say that their fellow Americans
are intelligent, while those who make more than $100,000 are far more
likely to say that Americans are unintelligent.*

*The results are not surprising. Western cultures have a habit of
inflating their self-worth, past research has shown. The most competent
individuals also tend to underestimate their ability, while incompetent
people overestimate it. Not out of arrogance, but of ignorance—the worst
performers often don’t get negative feedback. In this survey, 28 percent
of high school graduates say they are “slightly more intelligent” than
average, while just 1 percent of people with doctoral degrees say they
are “much less intelligent.”*

The second sentence in the last paragraph is interesting. “Western
cultures have a habit of inflating their self-worth, past research has
shown.” No actual study is noted, so it’s probably not true. That and
how people respond to self-assessment surveys is an area of some debate.
The respondent could very well be reacting to the questioner in a
culturally biased way. In Japan understatement is a valued social good
while in America, boasting is valued. What the respondent actually
thinks is unknowable.
