Watching the kids savage the shills of TP-USA this week, put me in the
mood to lash out at the libertarians. It is easy to forget that what is
currently called the conservative movement is really just
left-libertarianism. On the one hand, it is shilling for global
business, open borders and post-nationalism. On the other hand, it is
the left-wing war on western culture. Other than some vestigial
references to religion and traditional values, there’s no difference
between conservatism and libertarianism now.

I know a lot of old school libertarians think that their thing has been
hijacked by infidels and that real libertarianism can be compatible with
the dissident right. The trouble with that is they need to explain how
their thing was so easily taken over by the left-wing degenerates that
now dominate the racket. Again, the same critique applies here as to
Buckley-style conservatism. The reason these 20th century responses to
the Left failed is they all contained a fatal flaw that allowed them to
be co-opted.

Now, there is a case to be made that the undoing of libertarianism was
its associating with Buckley-style politics. The great paleo thinker Sam
Francis observed that the Buckleyites would inevitably be absorbed into
the managerial state, as they were engaging in politics on Progressive
terms. In order to gain a place on stage, they were forced to accept the
basic premise of Progressive politics. That is, they had to embrace the
blank slate and egalitarianism. That could only lead one way.

Perhaps that is so, but it does not change the fact that libertarianism
is now one of the heads of the monster. You see that in their response
to dissident politics. They immediately drop the mask and begin howling
left-wing talking points. The response from them to the groyper
rebellion is a perfect example. You see the same hysterics and name
calling that you see from the Left. It is a good reminder that these
people are just part of the candy coating of the Progressive nut inside.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
