A recurring feature of conservatism since at least the middle of the
last century has been the guy who seems to open his eyes to the problem
of progressivism only to come up with a response that promises to make
things worse. Conservative opposition to progressivism is usually just
surrender, but sometimes one of them finds some courage, but lands on a
solution that is guarantee to fail.

That is what we see with Christopher Rufo. He is the C-list conservative
pundit who has risen to fame taking on the diversity rackets. What
started out as an organic revolt among suburban parents over the lunacy
being taught to their kids has become a vehicle for Rufo. He has written
a book and become an anti-diversity-rackets crusader on social media.
His latest scalp the Harvard president.

While it is always fun to “own the libs” his proposed alternative to the
explicitly antiwhite diversity pogroms is actually worse than the
pogroms. The reason for that is his opposition starts with an
affirmation of the moral framework that not only makes these diversity
rackets possible, but inevitable. He spells it out in this
<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/a-new-civil-rights-agenda"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">essay</a> posted a few weeks ago, in
which is pulls the colorblind society from the conservative museum.

Not only is it an argument that failed when used half a century ago, it
is guaranteed to get us right back to where we are if it was
miraculously successful. A “color blind” society is no more possible
than communism. Worse yet, the underlying assertion is the same as
progressive diversify demands. Like the diversity gang, Rufo opposes
free association, self-ownership and free assembly.

That is the show this week. What Rufo is doing, whether he understands
it or not, is repeating old ideas first put forth by the open society
people, whose intent was to get us to this point with regards to free
association. He is taking old progressive ideas and now claiming they
are conservative principles. He is the current holder of the <a

conservative failure.
