One of the things that is being underscored by the war against Russia is
the isolation and insularity of the political class. They live in a
tightly controlled narrative structure in which all of their information
is filtered by the fulltime and permanent policy making class that
controls the official narratives. The readings in the show this week are
intended to show how that narrative structure is built.

It is a good example of how managerialism works in practice. There is
real information about what is happening on the battlefield. The
American military has men on the ground observing the Ukraine army. They
have men in Kiev working with the political and military control
systems. These people feed information back to Washington within their
respective chain of command.

That information does not get to the politicians. Instead, the top
people in the various agencies decide what will end up in official
briefings. They work with the semi-permanent foreign policy community,
controlled by the Kagan cult, to decide what gets transmitted to the
political class. It gets transmitted via direct briefing, through aides
and advisors or through the media.

Mostly what the politicians get is a moral framework. You see this in
these pieces in the show, especially the first one. With regards to
Ukraine, the managerial class has provided a moral framework for the
politicians and then provided them safe options within that framework.
Various politicians are then given information to argue their preferred
position within that framework.

Most everyone has wondered why no one in Washington asks the obvious
questions about the issues of the day. The reason is, they live in a
simulation of reality so that what is obvious to you is not obvious to
them. A few long serving insiders in leadership will have some access to
the truth, but that is only because they have been around so long their
handlers know they will not stray from the script.
