**Note: **Whenever I attend a secret handshake society, I get emails and
comments asking how one gets invited to these things. One way to get
connected is to donate to a place like Counter-Currents. They have get
togethers for donors, so if you are a donor you will get a chance to
attend. You can donate

For close to half a century, Western elites have been trying to reverse
many aspects of the industrial revolution that made the West possible.
It started in the United States with the off-shoring of whole industries
to the third world. Around the same time, the environmental movement
shifted from conservation to proselytizing against the things that
modern people take for granted. The fictional concept of climate change
was invented as an authority to justify the great deindustrialization.

At the heart of it all is energy. You cannot watch a television program
or view a YouTube clip without being hit on the head about good energy.
They have lots of ways of saying good energy, like renewable energy,
clean energy and green energy, but all of these slogans are just ways of
saying good energy. Of course, that means there is bad energy and that
is always the cheap energy. Gasoline is bad. Coal is bad. They may be
efficient and cheap, but they are bad, very bad.

The thing about good and bad, as moral concepts, is they are usually
judged by the distance from the person passing judgment. We are tuned to
oppose immoral acts, so if we see one up close and personal, our
response is stronger than if we hear about the same act third hand at a
dinner party. The guy we do not know very well who is caught cheating on
his wife effects us far less than seeing the neighbor having men over
while her husband is away at work.

Moral distance is at the heart of the long running scheme by Western
elites to remove from their sight the things they find immoral. They
inherited from Marxism the notion that industrial work in dehumanizing.
They do not want to see big dirty factories full of working class men
sweating away to make their stuff. They do not want to give up the
stuff, so the solution was to move the plant to Mexico or China. Replace
the plant with a dog park and voila! The world is a better place.

The same mindset is at work with so-called green energy. The truth of
the matter is all of the green energy schemes range from stupid to the
impractical. The appeal is not economic or environmental. The appeal is
aesthetic. The idea of windmills quietly generating electricity out
there in the countryside where the beautiful people rarely visit makes
for a pleasant image. The magical place that turns biomass into
electricity sounds great as long as you do not live near it.

This is why nuclear remains on the bad list. If the image of the nuclear
power plant was an underground facility, with a lovely little forest
above it, the greens would love the idea of nuclear energy. Instead, the
image of a nuke plant is the giant concrete cooling towers belching what
the greens thing is bad stuff. It is just water vapor, but it looks bad
so it must be bad. That windmill farm may be an abattoir for the eagle
population but it looks nicer than the nuke plant.

This function follows form mentality of the bourgeois managerial class
is at the heart of the current crisis in Europe. They hated the sight of
their energy system, so they have been slowly shifting it out of sight.
No one could see those giant gas pipelines or the massive holding
facilities. Everyone could feel like heroes for closing the coal plants
and refineries, while enjoying cheap energy. The ugliness of reality had
been sent east to Russia, so it was out of sight and out of mind.

This arrangement worked great until Washington decided to pick a fight
with Europe’s largest energy supplier. The entirety of the European
economy has been based on cheap energy from the east, but now that is
gone. Europe is now forced to buy expensive energy from other places.
This is slowly <a href="https://archive.ph/anyvt" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">cratering the economy</a> of Europe, leading to a great
deindustrialization of the continent. All of a sudden, those good
aesthetics are coming with a very steep price.

The fact is, Europe can remain a modern society if it accepts the costs
that come from being a modern society. Those costs are some sad women
sobbing over the ugly cooling towers or the sight of men working in
factories. Cheap food and warm homes come with smokestacks and
refineries. When you pick up one end of that stick you must pick up the
other end. Europe is plunging itself into darkness so the ruling class
can continue to play make believe.

That is fundamentally the issue. The ruling classes of the West no
longer have some external measure against which they can gauge their
piety. Christianity has long ago been purged from the ruling elites. The
old moral framework of liberalism was abandoned out of expedience. What
has filled the void is a weird, sterile aesthetic that seeks to remove
all traces of the human condition. The so-called green movement is
central to this cult of reality avoidance.

Reality does not go away when you stop believing in it. This is what
Europe is now facing with their energy crisis. Next up is a food crisis.
This is against the backdrop of the demographic crisis, which is another
aspect of the same disease. The unwillingness of elites to accept
biological reality has the same roots as their unwillingness to accept
the economic reality behind the modern age. We are ruled by people at
war with humanity because they cannot face the human condition.
