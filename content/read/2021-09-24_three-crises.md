The day job has me so busy I have no time to do much of anything, so my
news consumption has been cursory for the last few months. What I notice
is that all of the stuff the mainstream press is howling about falls
into three main buckets, the three crises of this week’s show. There is
other stuff like the handwringing about the little blonde girl murdered
by her boyfriend or some new Covid scam, but the main pages tend to be
filled with the three main buckets.

There is a fourth bucket that is starting to turn up and that is the
condition of the financial system, but that is still in the background.
It is hard to know what is happening in the economy, since we can no
longer trust the data. The only thing we can trust is the stock market
and that is being levitated by central banks. It used to tell us about
the state of the economy, but now it tells us only the state of money
pumping and the spigots are never going to be turned off.

It looks like the news next week will be about the legitimacy question
as someone leaked a [draft
copy](https://kjzz.org/content/1719314/arizona-election-audit-confirms-bidens-win-maricopa-county-also-casts-doubts)
of the Arizona audit report this morning. This was done so the media
could promote the regime lines about the election. When the real report
is released, it will not support the coordinated headlines this morning,
but by the time the real report is out it will be “old news” and
ignored. People will be left with the official narrative and never learn
the truth. This is a standard ploy.

What these people do not realize is that this undermines the credibility
of the system rather than knocking the critics for a loop. After all, it
should be the job of the media to ask who leaked the draft and what was
her motives. Someone in the media should ask why the exact same story is
in dozens of news sites at the same time. Of course, no one will ask,
and the critics will take the silence and the obvious coordination as
proof that their claims are correct. The coordinated lies just make
things worse.

There is also the knock-on effect of tuning out. I’ve noticed in my
daily life that more and more people are just tuning out the news. If it
is all predictable storytelling, then what is the point of tuning in for
any of it? I know when I look at the main sites it feels like they did
not change since the last time I looked at them. “Turn off, tune out,
drop out” would not be a bad slogan for dissidents. It would also be a
nice bit of irony if the end of the revolution begins with a slogan from
the start of it.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
