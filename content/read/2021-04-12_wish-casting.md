**Note:** The weekly Taki post is up
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/who-is-freer-these-days/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. This week I go back to an old
favorite of comparing modern day America to Russian, past and present.
There is also a cornucopia of items behind
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the green door</a>. Since so many were vexed with me
about my position on crypto, I suggest

target="_blank">proving me wrong</a> by sending me your crypto.

Hope and optimism are the two things that propel life forward. Sometimes
they lead to disaster, but often enough they lead to good results.
Innovation, after all, is rooted in hope and optimism. If cynicism were
the default for mankind, we would never have taken a shot on that new
thing called the wheel. Risk taking requires a degree of foolish
optimism and a hope that this time things will be different. On the
other hand, too much optimism becomes escapism, a way to avoid reality.

If it were possible to measure hope and optimism, specifically misplaced
hope and optimism, in a society, it would probably be a useful metric. A
people unrealistically hopeful for the future are probably filled with
dread, because their current situation is seemingly hopeless. Instead of
grimly facing the reality of their situation, many choose to cast their
hopes and aspirations onto someone or something. The popularity of
wish-casting increases as the situation declines.

An example of this would be the Obama presidency. Few people talk about
him these days, even though his term ended just five years ago. When he
ran for office, however, his fans talked about him like he was Jesus.
Despite his embarrassingly thin resume, they projected onto him the
image of black Lincoln. There was little reason to think this man would
do much of anything, given his nature and the people around him, but his
fans were sure he was going to usher in the golden age.

It feels like a long time ago, but it was a very strange phenomenon. The
people who had heralded Hillary Clinton as the new model woman suddenly
treated her as the locus of evil in the world. Their new champion
defeated her in the great contest and then he ascended the throne. Party
stores had special Obama themed items produced so believers could have
their Obama parties on inauguration day. For millions, it was the
rapture, except it happened entirely in their imagination.

Something similar happened with Trump at the end of his term. Unlike
Obama, he did not immediately develop a cult following. He won mostly
because the alternative was so unpleasant that anything had to be
better. It was during his term, as it became clear he was never going to
do what he promised, that he developed a cult following. By the end, he
was Trump the guy with a secret plan to win the election. When the
shenanigans hit home, he became a superhero with a secret plan to
overturn the result.

The Trump and Obama comparison offer an insight into how this
wish-casting phenomenon works in liberal democracy. The people
disappointed by Bill Clinton and then disaffected by Bush, turned to the
escapism of Obama. The same sort of thing happened with Trump, except it
required his victory in 2016 to trigger the process, as he was too much
of a known quantity in 2016. Obama was a blank slate, while Trump’s
slate needed a lot of scrubbing to clear some space for the
wish-casting.

The Q-phenomenon is another good example. What started as an internet
prank on the MAGA people became a weird fantasy cult. It combined the
elements of conspiracy theory with the essentials of wish-casting. Every
event was turned into proof that the prophesies would come true and the
faithful would be rewarded. The size of the Q-cult was exaggerated by
the media, of course, but a lot of people preferred that fantasy over
the reality of the present, which says a lot about the age.

The crypto cult is looking a lot like the Q-cult all of a sudden. This
one combines the silly promises of Austrian economics, the reality
avoidance of libertarianism, with a form of techno-futurism. Bitcoin is
going to usher in the anarcho-capitalist future, where the power of the
state is broken and all of the bad things about the cultural war are
rolled back to some happy place in the past. How this will happen does
not matter, as what matters is the dream of a new reality, free of the
present.

You can probably fit the insurrectionist fantasies of our political
class into this phenomenon as well. Rather than face the reality of
their situation, they focus on bizarre conspiracies about invisible
white supremacists. Reality is we live in a tripartite system of
corporate interests, radical cultural interests and the state. The
result is a doddering old man as the face of a nation slowly tipping
into crisis. Instead of facing that, they are obsessed with secret
conspiracies about white people.

That last bit becomes more interesting when you put it in the context of
the cult of Obama and how it ended. The lunacy that erupted on the Left
when Trump won in 2016 was never about Trump. It was about the final end
of the Obama fantasy. Not only was he not black Jesus, he was never the
savior. The people who worshipped him and hated Hilary, had transferred
their love for him onto Clinton and their hate for her onto Trump during
the 2016 election, especially toward the end.

What all of this suggests is we are moving further into a collective
psychological crisis as the cultural situation degrades. Rather than
face the reality of a fading empire that should have been dismantled
thirty years ago, people are escaping into these aspirational cults.
Even the political class is embracing escapism. There is always a bit of
irrational exuberance. Progress requires a degree of optimism. What we
are experiencing today is closer to systemic mass delusion.

This may not be entirely without precedent. Historians debate why the
Athenians waged the Peloponnesian War as they did. The decision to
attack Syracuse is a legendary blunder that defies reason. Perhaps it
was the result of the same phenomenon that we are seeing today. A
thoroughly democratized people, unable to face the reality of what that
entails, indulges in wish-casting, placing all hope into a person or a
plan. What lies at the other end is a shocking corrective that breaks
the spell.
