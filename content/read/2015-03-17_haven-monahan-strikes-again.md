campus</a>.

*A Penn State University fraternity was suspended for a year Tuesday
after police began investigating allegations that members used a
private, invitation-only Facebook page to post photos of nude and partly
nude women, some apparently asleep or passed out.*

*A former member of Kappa Delta Rho at the university’s flagship campus
in State College tipped police off to the page, telling them in January
that it had been used by members to share photos of “unsuspecting
victims, drug sales and hazing,” according to a copy of a police warrant
obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.*

*The ex-member also provided authorities with printouts from the page.*

I’ll just point out that the former member who ratted should get a
beating that his grand children will feel. That aside, “private” and
“invite-only” should be a clue here.

*The fraternity’s national executive director, Joe Rosenberg, told the
Penn State chapter in a letter on Tuesday that it is banned from most
activities for the near future and must reorganize.*

*He said the suspension was “for the most serious misconduct, most
serious disregard of fraternity rules, policies and property by the
chapter.”*

*Chapter officials, who can appeal the decision, did not respond to
messages seeking comment.*

*A Penn State administrator called the allegations a violation of the
standards and values required for recognized student organizations.*

*“The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive
and inconsistent with the university community’s values and
expectations,” Damon Sims, Penn State’s vice president for student
affairs, said in a news release.*

*Sims said the school continues to investigate, and vowed that the
university would find those responsible and hold them accountable.*

*Police said anyone who posted the photos could face misdemeanor charges
of harassment or invasion of privacy, with a fine the most likely
sentence.*

Posting naked picture is now a crime? That would be news to the billion
dollar porn industry. I guess the claim here is the women who got naked
and passed out from drugs or drink did not consent to having their
pictures taken. Here’s a top tip ladies. Don’t get so drunk that you
pass out naked in a frat house. That way, you won’t wake up as a glazed
doughnut or with your pics posted on-line.

The funny thing here is that the same people always saying the girls can
play with the boys suddenly sound like a Victorians when the girls get
into trouble. Guys have been doing rotten things to guys who pass at the
party since the Viking age. Maybe all that feminist nonsense about girls
being able to party with the boys was not right after all.
