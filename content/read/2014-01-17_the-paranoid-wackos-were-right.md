The main problem with conspiracy theories is they require things of
government and government people, that you never see in real
life. Government is big, ponderous and stupid. It is a sledgehammer when
it works at all. The sort of precision needed to micromanage the
population has never been observed in government. The Soviets tried the
hardest, but failed to do any more than murder anyone who go out of
line. Even the North Koreans have found it nearly impossible to
granularly control their society.

Then there are stories like
<a href="http://archive.is/qbFhf" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this one</a>, which show how even the blunt instrument
of government can be turned into a sensitive instrument of oppression. A
crazy cop or even a crazy cop department can tap into the vast database
of information the state and its agents have about all of us. if they
find something they don’;t like, even if it is perfectly legal, they can
make your life a living hell. The state and its agents can weaponize
information to bully and intimidate even the most law abiding citizens.

This cop did not act on his own. It is the policy of the police in
Maryland to harass gun owners. The police will never admit to it, but it
is so obvious that it is not a secret. The cops say they are just
following procedure, which is true, but many are eager to show their
enthusiasm. The cop could never have done anything like this ten years
ago. In a decade, agents of the state will be able to pull up your
medical history at routine traffic stops. Turning the cops into morality
police will be just a matter of changing a policy.

<a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/01/08/bitcoin-internet-of-money/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> from last week
shows the way. Linking your DNA to an electronic ID like a Bitcoin would
solve a lot of the technical hurdles for the surveillance state. DNA is
unique and Bitcoin is unique. You can’t fake either one so it is
impervious to counterfeiting if it your official ID. All of your
transactions would then require some of your DNA, which could be as
little as a few skin cells. The technology is not there yet, but within
the decade it will be ready. That means everywhere you go can be
tracked.

It turns out the paranoid types were right all along.
