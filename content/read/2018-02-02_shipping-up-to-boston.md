This is a road trip podcast. I’ve been on the road and I remain on the
road through the weekend. As this goes up, I’m in Boston. That means I
recorded this in bits and pieces as I had time. It also means I did so
in odd places, like police stations, cemeteries and sorority houses.
Usually, I put this together later in the week, trying to include at
least one news item, but this week, I had to get things done earlier
than normal. It has been pre-recorded for your future listening
pleasure. Take that space-time continuum!

I’ve come down with a case of Ebola this week. It is running rampant in
Lagos on the Chesapeake. I rarely get sick, but I’ve got it this time.
If my voice sounds a bit odd, that’s probably the reason. There’s also
the fact that I’ve not had a lot of energy so I was not enthusiastic
about cleaning up the audio. That is a tedious task, made infinitely
more tedious when fighting off the monkey virus. But, I take pride in
never letting poor health keep me from work, so I pushed through it.
Like Hitler, I suffer for my art.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
