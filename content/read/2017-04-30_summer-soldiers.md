Street protests and street theater are largely useless as political
tactics in the modern age. A century ago, a gaggle of prim-faced scolds
marching through the middle of town, demanding the end of alcohol, not
only got people’s attention, it changed their minds about the issue. The
street protests projected strength and suggested that the numbers on the
side of the marchers were larger than assumed. The men in charge
responded by giving women the franchise and banning alcohol. The
downward spiral started soon after.

Today, people know that the street protest is a made for TV event and
that the “protesters” are often paid to show up and make noise.
Alternatively, it is assumed that the true believers are batshit crazy
and best ignored. In other words, it’s just another TV show in an age
where we are awash in TV shows. For the most part, the street protest is
for weak losers desperate for attention. The only impact they have on
the larger public is to confirm that the “movement” is impotent and can
be ignored.

That does not mean street theater is entirely worthless. The alt-right
showing up at Berkeley to beat up the Antifa losers was entertaining and
it did scare the people in charge of the place. So much so they moved
heaven and earth to block Ann Coulter’s speech last week. Make no
mistake, the reason the school went to all this trouble is they feared a
bunch of dudes in home made battle gear beating the hell out of the
Potemkin Protesters the Left now hires to do their protesting for them.
A replay would be embarrassing.

Berkeley is the epicenter of West Coast progressive lunacy so for the
true believers at the center of the hive to feel this uncertain is
suggestive. They have been in charge for so long they just take it for
granted. The narrative says they are the ones in the street fighting the
man. When the roles are flipped and they are suddenly the man, their go
to move is to shut it all down. They have no choice, as to do otherwise
would mean facing up to the reality of their situation and that’s never
going to happen with true believers.

The real lesson, the one most useful to the alt-right, is seeing the
controlled opposition confirm what many have been pointing out for years
now. As soon as things got a little tough, the College Republicans
folded their tents and blamed the “extremists” of the alt-right. The
Young American Foundation, a Conservative Inc. racket to recruit college
students, made a show of “defending free speech” but made sure they did
not offer any material support. It was just another way to raise money
for their racket.

In contrast, a handful of rednecks down south were able to force Auburn
to host the notorious Richard Spencer, a guy everyone seems to think is
Hitler in a cardigan. They went to court and quickly forced the school
to honor its legal obligations. They were also able to rally a security
force and get the cops to enforce public order. The result being a
peaceful and orderly event. Conservative Inc. has tens of millions in
cash at their disposal and an army of elite educated lawyers and they
could not even defend Coulter.

What they could do though, is <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attack Ann Coulter</a> when
she correctly pointed out that the summer soldiers of Conservative Inc
ran and hid as soon as things got difficult. David French is a mentally
unbalanced crackpot, but he does speak for the dwindling number of
Buckley Conservatives, who claim to be the vanguard of anti-Progressive
forces in America. French speaks for all of the so-called conservatives
when he is more upset at Coulter’s noticing than he is at black clad
thugs shutting down her speech.

The whole affair is insignificant in isolation, but it is a another
reminder to those who have begun the journey away from
Buckley Conservatism, Libertarianism and boomer politics that those
well-paid heroes of the Right never win these fights. They invest so
heavily in the symbolism of conservatism because they conserve nothing
but their own place at Lefty’s table. At best they are well-intentioned
losers. At worst, they are willing props deployed by the ruling
orthodoxy to disrupt the opposition.

The people in the dissident movements are not without their problems and
many of them are certainly nuts, but that’s the nature of outsider
movements. What’s increasingly clear is the fact that it is the outsider
movements who are scoring the victories. They are the people changing
minds and forcing the the fight onto the turf of Lefty. It’s not
the dorks in blue blazers mooning over photos of Reagan. It’s the guys
with home made armor decorated with sun wheels and cartoon frogs.

The other day, an old friend, who was a “happy warrior” type, mostly in
the libertarian wing of the Buckley Right, quoted Mike Cernovich to me.
I cautioned him to not take everything Cerno says at face value and he
responded with, “Hey, no enemies on the Right.” A year ago he probably
would have sided with David French or at least frowned upon the
alt-right guys raising hell. When given the choice between those who are
not afraid to be called a heretic and those who live in fear of it,
people naturally choose the former over the latter.
