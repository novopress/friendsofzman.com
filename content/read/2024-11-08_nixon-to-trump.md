It has been roughly fifty years since Nixon was forced from office.
Watergate has largely slipped from our collective memory as most of the
main players have slipped loose from this mortal coil. At the time, it
was considered the greatest political scandal in American history, maybe
even a near death experience. Nixon was not denounced as Hitler, but you
can see the beginnings of that impulse in this period.

Another thing forgotten is that Nixon remained a bogeyman for the people
we call the left long after the scandal. Reagan was compared to Nixon.
The Democrat Congress relentlessly investigated him, sure that he was
doing Nixon stuff. The Iran – Contra affair was supposed to be his
Watergate. Bush I got the Nixon treatment as well with the whole October
surprise business.

The election of Bill Clinton seems to have put an end to the Nixon
stuff, as it boomeranged back on the Democrats. This also may turn out
to be the high-water mark for the forces behind the toppling of Nixon
and the aftermath. The managerial state has been in decline ever since.
We are now at the final chapter of a period that started with FDR,
climaxed in Watergate and may now be coming to an end.

The managerial system that was born under FDR, or at least came into
practice, finally took control of the political system during Watergate.
It was the “deep state” that took down Nixon and the “deep state” is
just a spooky word for the permanent set of institutions that now govern
us. The election of Trump in 2024, roughly fifty years after Watergate,
may signal the end of managerialism.
