It has been dark and dreary here in Lagos, so I decided to go a little
lighter this week and do a show on Valentine’s Day. The original plan
was to just do a segment on it, but it turned out to be a good jumping
off point for other related topics. It’s one of those topics that
naturally leads to other things related to dissident politics. After
all, the whole point of the celebration is to encourage romance, which
presumably leads to marriage and baby making, something in short supply
in the West.

Like a lot of the topics I do, this is one I could easily do much more
on, but I try to stick to the format, which means not getting too deep
in the weeds. The history of marriage, for example, could easily be a
few hours of time. Plotting marriage patterns in the West from before
the Romans to today makes a good case for how the West has been
regressing over the last century. It is another one of those areas that
suggests our cultural views are growing more primitive.

The marriage topic also underscores just how much of our history has
been anathematized by our cultural rulers. The evolution of romance and
courting in the medieval period, for example, is something that should
be counted as a great innovation of the West and Christianity. It had an
enormous impact on the trajectory of the European people. Instead, all
we get are harangues about how women are still suffering under the yoke
of male supremacy.

The evolution of marriage in Europe is also a great example of how
elites can change the culture if they so choose. The prohibitions on
consanguinity, for example, altered European society for the better. The
Romans then the Church saw the civilizing consequences of banning cousin
marriage, even if they did not understand the mechanism behind it. The
Occident is not an accident of nature. It is the product of many
conscious decisions made over the centuries.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
