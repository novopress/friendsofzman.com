The title of this post comes from *On the Laws*, a Socratic dialogue
written by Marcus Tullius Cicero toward the end of the Roman Republic.
The title is from Plato’s famous dialogue, *The Laws*. In this work,
Cicero creates a fictional conversation between himself, his brother and
a friend about the law and social harmony. *Salus populi suprema lex
esto* is a famous line that means, “The health of the people should be
the supreme law”. Sometimes “health” is translated as “welfare.”

It is a famous phrase that turns up all over America. You can often find
it in the official seal of cities and towns. Manassas Virginia has it in
the town seal. A number of states have it in their official seal. It is
not just in America where you will find it. All across the English
speaking world this line turns up in the official branding of tiny
villages, big cities, and important institutions. This concept of the
ruling class being duty bound to the welfare of the people is near
universal.

The reason for the ubiquity is it turns up in the foundational works of
what we have come to call Western liberalism. It is the epigraph of John
Locke’s *Second Treatise on Government*, arguably the most important
influence on the Framers. Hobbes and Spinoza, influences on Locke, also
used the phrase and embraced the concept as presented by Cicero. The
Roundheads in the English Civil War also embraced the phrase and the
meaning behind it.

Despite most Americans never having heard of Cicero, the spirit of this
age is animated by the simple concept behind that Latin phrase. It is
what lies behind the urge to censor speech online, for example. The
welfare in question when demanding you get booted from social media is
the psychological health of the people. The censors assume that they are
the guardians of the mental peace and tranquility, so they must make
sure that deviationists like you are silenced.

It is what lies behind the persecution of protestors in America and the
UK. The striking similarity between the draconian punishments handed out
by the UK government against those protesting immigration and those
being persecuted in the United States over January 6 is not an accident.
The people doing this are sure they are defending “our democracy” from
hooliganism. They can think this because they assume their position
requires them to defend the welfare of the people.

Of course, Cicero would have been baffled by what is happening in this
age, especially since he was murdered by agents of the Second
Triumvirate, for the crime of speaking out against the tyranny of Mark
Antony. The modern notion that the state must safeguard the moral health
of the people to the point of jailing those who dare question public
policy would have baffled the ancients. From the perspective of the
ancient world, what we are seeing today is the worst form of government,
democracy.

As for John Locke, he was a man of his age and in his age the state, in
the person of the king, was responsible for the material wellbeing of
the people. It was the duty of the state to defend the lands of the
people from outsiders. It defended the people from internal threat
through the execution of the laws. The spiritual well-being of the
people was in the hands of the church. John Locke would have been as
baffled as Cicero at the Roundheadism of the current age.

In fairness to the modern age, the collapse of the Christian churches
leaves a void as far as the spiritual guardianship of the people. Even a
century ago, most Americans would have shared the same ethical outlook,
because their ethics would have come from the Christian churches.
Doctrinal differences aside, the ethics of the New England
Congregationalist were not all that different from an Appalachian
Presbyterian, a Southern Baptist, or a Midwestern Methodist.

The collapse of Christian institutions in the twentieth century meant
something had to replace them as far as the ethical instruction of the
people. Being the most powerful institution, it was natural that the
state should take on this duty. Of course, the state was also
responsible for the destruction of the churches. The peculiar
composition of the post-war ruling class made Christian ethics a bit of
a problem, so the ruling class slowly replaced those Christian ethics
with a new set of ethics.

It is why it is important to understand that what we see happening is
not merely the desire to hold power, but a religious revolt against the
people. The bizarre outbursts we see are on the one hand an effort to
demonstrate the weakness of the old ethics and the religion behind it,
but on the other hand an effort to clear the path for the embrace of the
new religion and its new ethical code. Woke is nothing more than
proselytizing on behalf of the new religion, even if they do not realize
it.

This is why the state has reacted with increasing ferocity at resistance
to the cultural revolution from the top. Your efforts to reason with
them or point to tradition are viewed by the ruling class as a radical
rejection of their primary duty, which is to safeguard the welfare of
the people. In the minds of the people in charge, they are on the side
of a long tradition dating to the ancients. It is you and your weird
adherence to out of fashion faith and custom that is subversive.

In the end, the present ruling elite of the West will not be judged by
how well they upheld the traditions and ethics of the ruling class they
displaced. It will not be their authoritarianism or anti-Christian
bigotry that is their undoing. It will be how well they safeguard the
welfare of the people. Since they have taken on the spiritual wellbeing
of the people, they will be judged at how well they perform their
priestly roles and the reasonableness of their new religions edicts.
