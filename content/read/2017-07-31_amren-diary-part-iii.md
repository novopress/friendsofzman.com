On Friday night, Jared Taylor took to the podium to welcome everyone,
but also remind everyone that the protesters would be out in force on
Saturday. His order was to ignore them and avoid engaging with them. A
local judge had ruled that the protesters had a right to harass the
people at the facility and come inside to use the facilities. That meant
it was possible the protesters would try to bust in and disrupt things.
As a result, the park police were deployed inside as well as outside in
an effort to maintain order.

From what I was told by one of the cops, the previous events had avoided
all of this by putting the protesters on a hill well away from the
facility. That way they could be easily contained by the park police and
easily ignored by everyone else. The judge, a liberal for sure, did not
like that so she came up with a plan in the hopes of creating a violent
confrontation. It is a helpful reminder that the rent-a-nuts we see at
these things are paid for by the ruling class. In a sane society, Antifa
would not exist.

Despite the best efforts of our rulers, Antifa was more entertainment
than political statement. The conference people stayed inside and
largely ignored them. The young people could not avoid pulling out their
cell phones and taking pics of the circus through the windows. Then they
started taking selfies with the circus in the background. The scene had
the feel of a futuristic zoo, where people get to view the humans who
came out of the factory with serious flaws. It is hard not to laugh at
this stuff.

<a href="https://twitter.com/lacymacauley?lang=en" rel="noopener"

where I got that tweet is useful, when thinking about groups like
Antifa. Pretty much everything she tweeted about the day did not happen.
There were no gun shots or confrontations. It was just a few hours of a
freak show, where bizarrely dressed people and septuagenarian hippies
danced around in the parking lot. It was a hot day and most of them ran
out of steam by mid-afternoon. The whole thing was so silly, I suspect
even some of the protesters felt ridiculous.

For Lacy MacAuley though, the thirst for violence is all consuming. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story</a> about her trip to Turkey
and <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">this story</a> about getting beat by
Turks are good examples. This is a person who hates herself and hopes
for nothing more than a violent denouement to her otherwise pointless
existence. That’s probably true of almost all of these people. They
self-mutilate and dress like clowns because they seek to degrade
themselves. Almost all of them smoke and by the looks of it, I’m
guessing, many use street drugs to excess.

Watching the freaks dance, as they tried to take photos of everyone
inside, I noticed that it was a girl thing. There were extremely ugly
old women, wearing shirts with feminist slogans. There were a few
younger women, dressed in what used to be the uniform of the skateboard
punk. The young ones clearly were the ones hoping for some
ultra-violence, like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PevGWvB7Z_s" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the stupid girl Damigo decked at Berkeley</a>. And of
course,
<a href="https://twitter.com/stoner_elite/status/891346996656734208"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">there was a tranny</a>. This one was
maybe six foot tall, with half its head shaved and the other side died
bright yellow.

This reminded me of how David Horowitz described the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Weathermen</a>. In the late sixties and
early seventies, the normal white males had either left or were pushed
aside in radical politics. Instead, it was blacks and white women. In
both cases, it was the women who had the greatest thirst for blood.
Similarly, the Manson gang’s women were the ones hellbent on murdering
people. The American Left has been a feminine movement for at least
fifty years and maybe longer. After all, women pushed through
Prohibition.

That raises something else that was obvious on Saturday. Antifa is a
cargo cult. They think if they ape the aesthetics of the radicals from
the past, the past will become the present. Many of the geezers I saw at
the protest were just reliving their youth, if they ever stopped living
their youth. The younger ones though, they are romantics. They believe
the world needs to return to a better time when they were the radicals
and people cared about their issues. Antifa and the other Progressive
rent-a-mobs are the death rattle of the Left.

Oswald Spengler wrote about this phenomenon. A culture, like a person,
is born, lives and then it dies. Like a person, it’s youth is a chaotic
becoming, while its maturing is what it became. It’s death is
romanticizing what it was and then, it is gone. That’s the American Left
now. It is a thing for old people and young romantics, but the death
certificate has been filled out with everything but the date. The
radical culture that was born in the 60’s and flourished for two
generations is about to expire.

One final thought on this. I was standing in front of the big glass
windows watching the Antifa loonies, when I turned and looked at the
young AmRen guys taking pics and selfies, laughing and enjoying
themselves. On one side of the glass were grotesquely out of shape
people in grubby clothes, smoking and gesticulating. On the other were
young men in suits, well groomed and composed. It was one of those times
when you can stand on the timeline of your life and see the past and the
future at the same time.
