on Substack who would never sign up for SubscibeStar and plenty of
people on SubscribeStar who have no interest in moving to Substack.
Green door content will be posted on both so pick your poison.

In the classic comedy, *The Jerk*, there is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaz2hxZLycY" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">scene</a> in which the main character, played by Steve
Martin, is in court. He is being sued because the invention that made
him rich is supposedly causing everyone to go cross-eyed. He invented a
thing to go on the bridge of glasses that prevents them from falling
forward when you look down. In the scene, Martin looks around and sees
that everyone in the court, including the judge and the jury, are
cross-eyed like the people suing him.

This is what Elon Musk is going to face in the Delaware Court of
Chancery Chancellor when his case against Twitter goes to trial. That
assumes it ever gets to a trial, as there is a good chance his lawyers
see the writing on the wall long before that point and there is some
sort of settlement. The Twitter legal team features a former chief judge
from the Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor. No doubt there are
others with connections to the small club that is the Delaware bench.

Like the Steve Martin character in that movie, Musk is about to learn
that the laws and procedures do not matter. What matters is <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/twitter-wins-bid-for-expedited-trial-to-force-musk-to-close-deal.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">who</a> decides. Every judge on the
Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor was put there by a politician.
Those politicians were selected for their loyalty to a system that many
deny exists. That system is the managerial system that governs America.
You do not get into office with a chance to wield real power unless you
are trusted by the system.

System is probably not the best word for what we are seeing. It is more
like a mindset, a set of shared beliefs. The judge in the Twitter case,
Kathaleen McCormick, will look out at the players and see that Musk is
not her sort. He is not the type of person she thinks should be a winner
in this world. She thinks this because everyone she knows thinks this
about Musk. She may not be able to say why she thinks Musk is a threat
to our democracy, but she is sure of it.

It was not always this way for Musk. He was once the darling of the
managerial class, celebrated in popular culture as a modern day Thomas
Edison. He was serving Gaia with his electric cars and hyper loops. His
battery plants would magically allow us to stop raping Mother Earth for
fossil fuels. His reward would be to one day travel the stars in his
rocket ships. Musk was the way to the glorious future. When he spoke out
against Twitter, he suddenly transformed into the terrible past.

This is what stumps people about managerialism. There was no official
pronouncement from the leader of the managers. The supreme leader of
managerialism did not read out a fatwa against Elon Musk. There is not
even an anonymous memo circulating that says Musk is now on the
proscribed list. It is a thing that just happened. One day, people with
power were showering Musk with your money. Then all of a sudden, they
all agreed that Musk was a threat to our democracy.

Another example of the managerial mindset is in this <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/23/lawyers-gun-rights-supreme-court-00041909"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> about the law firm that won the
recent gun case in the Supreme Court. The two lawyers who won the case
were met with a termination letter after their victory. The law firm,
Kirkland & Ellis, represents the most important people in the most
important matters. There is a revolving door between Kirkland & Ellis
and the Department of Justice. Former AG Bill Bar was a Kirkland man, as
were many on his team.

Why is Kirkland & Ellis dropping second amendment cases? No one has made
an official announcement on the issue. The attorneys who won the gun
case stated that they were told the firm was dropping their gun clients.
No one came to the partners of Kirkland & Ellis and made them an offer
they could not refuse. They simply decided that their conscience could
no longer allow them to handle these cases. Then they were celebrated
for it by their friends down at the club.

This is the first domino. All of the other big forms will drop second
amendment litigation because they will all be struck by the same crisis
of conscience. Much the same has happened in the insurance industry.
Insurers refused to do business with the National Rifle Association.
Many banks have also joined the boycott. Again, there was no memo sent
out from the secret lair in the hollowed out volcano. No one is forcing
these big players to do this. They just think it is right.

It is one of things the paleos got wrong about managerialism. Perhaps
wrong is too strong a word for it. More like they did not anticipate it.
Burnham, a former communist, focused on the material aspects. He never
addressed the culture of managerialism that was evolving along with the
managerial system. Later paleos started to approach this topic, but they
never fully embraced the idea that this class that rules over American
society has reached class consciousness.

That class consciousness is not simply an awareness of their position
with regards to economic and cultural relations. It is a moral community
now. To be in the managerial class requires accepting a set of beliefs
about what is right and wrong. Good people accept climate change. Bad
people are deniers. Good people think guns are bad, while the bad people
talk about their second amendment rights. The good people saw Trump as a
threat to our democracy. The bad people voted for him.

This is what Musk faces in the Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor. He
may have the facts on his side with regards to the fake accounts. He may
have the law on his side with regards to the terms of the deal. He has
all the money in the world, which should count for a lot. None of that
may matter as the people making the decision have all decided that he is
a bad guy. Like every issue for the managerial class, Musk is now a
moral signifier. Where you stand on him is where you stand on
everything.
