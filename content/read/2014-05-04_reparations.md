The other day on Marginal Revolution, Steve Sailer was holding forth on
an IQ topic in the comments section. As is often the case, the comments
drifted into the areas of race and all of the taboos that surround the
topic. These days, it is hard to have a serious on-line discussion about
race, because everyone is afraid and the discussion gets loaded up with
moral posturing. Anyway, Sailer responded to someone with this:

One way or another, white America is going to be paying the Slave Trade
Tax for, roughly, ever. Therefore, I don’t mind giving racial
preferences to the 12% or whatever of the population who are the direct
descendants of slaves in America, and I don’t mind the 1% who are
American Indians having casinos or whatever.

On the other hand, I’m not at all happy about ethnic preferences for
immigrant groups, such as the 17% (and rapidly growing) of the country
who are Hispanics. They chose to come here. And I’m not at all happy
about the business breaks that Asians get, which are so valuable that in
1982 Indians got the government to move them out of the Caucasian
category and in with the Orientals so they could get minority business
development breaks on government contracts and low interest SBA loans.

Charles Murray is probably right and we will be clawing each others eyes
out in the not too distant future as a result of the racial spoils
system. It is one thing for the dominant group to buy off the minority
group to keep the peace. Once you get into competition between groups
for a share of the spoils, the result is predictable. As Steve notes,
immigrants are jumping on this system, which will accelerate the
problem. The suicidal whites in charge now will be pushed aside one way
or another.

A way out of this trap is reparations for slavery. Reparations pops up
from time to time, but no one takes it seriously. The reason is the
people making the case are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ridiculous</a> or simply <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darron-t-smith-phd/a-new-case-for-african-am_b_4345768.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">illiterate</a>. The problem is
compounded by the difficulty of calculating a fair number for
reparations. In civil suits, the actual damages have to be proved.
Punitive damages are usually done by a formula of some sort.

If we were actually settling up with real former slaves, that would be a
good starting point.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Magee"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The last slave died in
1971</a>, but most were long gone 100 years ago. One of the unreported
facts of Reconstruction is black life expectancy fell dramatically after
slavery, so most of the former slaves were gone a few decades. Even
their direct decedents were gone by the early 20th century.

Then there’s another problem. If you were living in sub-Saharan Africa
in the 17th or 18th century, life was going to be short and brutal.
Slavery sounds awful, but it turns out to have been better than living
in Africa. Slaves had value to their owners so they took care of them.
There is no better place to be black than America. The decedents of
slaves are reaping a huge reward for being the decedents of slaves. If
we are going to build a case for reparations, you have to factor in that
huge benefit, as well.

All that said, what’s the price of a clean conscience? Whites in charge
of America pretend to be racked with guilt and demand all whites feel
shame for slavery. Settling up with black people may very well be the
best solution to finally close the books on this issue for good. It may
also be the only way to dismantle the racial spoils system before it
tears the nation apart. Given the push for open borders, we may have but
a few more years before things get very tough.

A simple proposal. Everyone descended from slaves, over the age of 25
gets $10,000 per year, distributed on their birthday. To get on the
gravy train of reparations, they must do a few things. One is you must
provide a <a
href="http://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/ghl/resources/genealogy/slaverecords.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genealogical history</a>
showing you are directly descended from former slaves on both sides of
the family. That means if you’re Barak Obama, you’re not getting
reparations, but his wife would be eligible. The kids would not be as
their father is not a descendant of slaves.

Another requirement would be DNA testing. We know enough at this point
to confirm the basics. Weeding out the hustlers and con-men would be a
little easier with DNA evidence. Someone who is 50% Chinese, indicating
a Chinese parent, could look like Tiger Woods and thus try to get on the
payroll. This would also be a service to people who cannot piece
together their genealogical records completely. If you are the relative
of someone who has established their line, you can use that information.

Finally, the criminals would lose their entitlement. Sending checks to
prisoners or their families is asking for trouble. Once the person has
paid their debt to society and been crime free for a number of years,
then the benefit can resume. Using this program as a nudge to obey the
law is a low cost choice with some obvious benefits. Most black
criminals would not be motivated by this provision, but some would.
Given the enormous crime rate among blacks, a little goes a long way.

The data on recipients would need to be public. That way the public can
help supervise the program by spotting and reporting cheaters. It could
also have value to scientists researching DNA, evolution and so forth.
The Civil Rights Act  and the Voting Rights Act would be repealed as
part of the program. The savings on mischief from those programs would
off-set the cost of reparations. The books would then be closed on
slavery and segregation. Normalcy would be restored.

That’s why this can never happen.

One way or another, white America is going to be paying the Slave Trade
Tax for, roughly, ever. Therefore, I don’t mind giving racial
preferences to the 12% or whatever of the population who are the direct
descendants of slaves in America, and I don’t mind the 1% who are
American Indians having casinos or whatever.

On the other hand, I’m not at all happy about ethnic preferences for
immigrant groups, such as the 17% (and rapidly growing) of the country
who are Hispanics. They chose to come here. And I’m not at all happy
about the business breaks that Asians get, which are so valuable that in
1982 Indians got the government to move them out of the Caucasian
category and in with the Orientals so they could get minority business
development breaks on government contracts and low interest SBA loans.
