For generations in the West, it has been asserted that democracies do
not go to war with one another. The claim is based on the extremely
limited experience with democratic processes in the 20th century. The
nations with democratic elements, as defined by the victors, did not go
to war with one another. Britain (democratic) did not go to war with
France(democratic) despite being a long time rival. Instead, Britain
joined France against the anti-democratic states of the Axis powers.

This claim was a gratuitous assertion for the purpose of selling
democracy as the cure for national conflict. In the same way that
globalism is pitched as solution to war, democracy is pitched as the
antidote to human conflict. It is at the heart of the claim the spread
of liberal democracy in the post-Cold War world must inevitably remove
war from the policy choices of nations. If liberal democracies do not go
to war with one another, then a world of liberal democracies is free of
war.

When you think about these claims from the post-Cold War period of
American triumphalism, they are just repackaged claims from the past.
Thomas Freidman’s argument in *The Lexus and the Olive Tree* is a
post-modern retelling of the arguments in *The Great Illusion*.
Fukuyama’s argument in *The End of History* is another iteration of the
claims that have been made since Adam Smith. Human conflict can be tamed
with rules and commerce.

It is an curious belief at the heart of liberal democracy when you stop
and consider the mechanics of it. Trade between countries is just
shorthand for the trade between individuals in one country with those in
another country. Disputes between individuals in commerce are the norm.
It is a game of each side trying to take advantage of the other and no
one likes being beat this way. Scaled up and it means disputes between
countries trading with one another are inevitable.

This is where the myopia and insularity of the managerial class, a
creation of the haute bourgeoise, comes into play. This layer of middle
managers and middle men are convinced they solve any dispute with the
right credentials and a large enough committee budget. The managerial
system is a self-licking ice cream cone, a self-referential process that
prevents the participants from looking too closely at the mechanics of
liberal democracy.

Democracy, of course, is a magical form of mob rule in which all of us
are smarter than any of us. It just assumes that if the dumbest people
are allowed to have input on the decisions, then somehow those decisions
improve. In every other aspect of life, the goal is to keep the stupid
people out of the decision tree, but with democracy the goal is to not
only recruit them, but to elevate them. If prudence says to avoid war,
then allowing the imprudent to rule means war is more likely.

The war-like nature of democracy is easy to see. Athens was the first
great democracy and it was incapable of being a good neighbor. The
greatness of Athens was the product of the wars with Persia. The golden
age of Athens was between 480 – 404 BC and the Greco-Persian wars were
from 499 BC to 449 BC. The Peloponnesian War lasted from 431 BC to 404
BC. In other words, the primary feature of democratic Athens was not
cultural production by endless war.

America is arguably the first liberal democratic state. Like Athens, it
was founded in war and like Athens has been at war throughout its life.
A few years after the founding there was the War of 1812, then the Civil
War. That ushered in an unusual few decades of peace, but then it was
back to war with Spain, then most of Europe. The bodies were not even
cold from the Second World War and the great liberal democracies were
declaring war on Soviet Russia.

It is the post-Cold War period where you see the violence of democracy.
The end of the long struggle with communism should have resulted in a
great transitioning from the war economy to a peace economy. Instead,
what followed was a generation of war against the Muslims. Now we have a
new cold war, possibly even a hot war, with Russia over things no one
bothers to explain. The reason for that is no one cares. Liberal
democracy needs war. That is the reason for the war.

Once again, we see that the economic claims contained in the arguments
about liberal democracy and peace do not hold up. Russia is an important
part of the global supply chain for things like energy, food and raw
materials. The liberal democracies are willing to starve their people to
make war on the Russians. The same dynamic is shaping up with China,
which is the manufacturer of many Western goods. Liberal democracy is
unconstrained by economic concerns when it comes to war.

It is tempting to pin the violence of liberal democracy on the people at
the top of the Global American Empire. There is some truth to it, but we
have other examples of how the democratic ethos leads to violence. The
French Revolution was the first flowering of the democratic ideal. It
quickly descended into a bloodbath then Napoleon, a man determined in to
conquer the world, in the name of the people of France. The birth of
democracy in Europe was a very bloody one.

Communism is usually placed outside of democracy, but this is a
gratuitous assertion by proponents of liberal democracy. Communism is
probably the most democratic philosophy, as it is the most egalitarian.
Once you assume universal equality, you inevitably assume universal
participation in society. Of course, universal equality solves the moral
questions, so there is not only no need for politics, but there is no
need for the limits of politics. One hundred million people died to
prove it.

The point of all this is that real world testing of the theories of
democracy and liberal democracy make clear that it is a horribly violent
pathology. Just as the real communism has never been tried, the real
democracy has never existed, because the claims of democracy and now
liberal democracy are incompatible with humanity. Rather than unleashing
human potential, liberal democracy makes war on human nature and what
follows is endless conflict to distract from this reality.

Perhaps the world war that is brewing between the West and the world is
the final act in a play that started with the Enlightenment. In one
final convulsion the monstrous ideas that were born in the “age of
reason” will finally be defeated. Liberal democracy will be shown to be
no better of an implementation of these ideas than communism or fascism
was in the last century. One last effort to immanentize the eschaton
will violently remove this lunacy from the mind of Western man.
