In 19th century America, it was popular to argue that there are four
boxes for maintaining political liberty: soap, ballot, jury, and
cartridge. There is also a version that has just three boxes, which
drops the jury box from the model. The soap box is public speech used to
persuade the ruling class. The ballot box is the democratic process. The
jury box is the legal process, and the cartridge box is violence. The
order of the boxes is important as it is both a warning and a promise.

The warning here is directed toward the public. Skipping any of these
steps will inevitably be self-defeating. The sorts of people who want to
litigate everything, for example, are the sorts of people who will
litigate away your liberty. We see this with the inferior court judges.
They are like all self-defined underdogs. When they get on top, they are
just as intolerant and as cruel as the people they opposed. These people
are always more dangerous than present tyrants.

The other side of this is directed at the people in charge. Their status
as a ruling elite depends on making sure that the traditional rights and
protections of the people are maintained in those first two boxes. Once
the people abandon the soap box and the ballot box for the jury box, it
is not long before they reach for the cartridge box, and there is no
turning back from that one. Of course, an elite that uses the jury box
to undermine the ballot box is asking for the cartridge box.

That is what we see in the West: the use of lawfare by the managerial
class to both circumvent the soap box and the ballot box. The latest
example is in France, where the courts have willy-nilly decided that the
most popular politician in the country is no longer allowed to
participate in politics. Marine Le Pen was found guilty of trumped-up
charges and sentenced to what amounts to internal banishment. Her
punishment is like what happened to Khrushchev in the 1960s.

This is the pattern in the West. Romania arrested and then banned the
most popular politician in the country for the crime of winning the
election. Germany is planning to ban the AfD for the crime of being
popular. The new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has publicly stated that
one of his goals will be to work with the EU to overthrow the Hungarian
government. Of course, the UK has declared itself an apartheid state by
imposing a two-tiered legal regime aimed at the opposition.

The most famous example of the managerial class abuse of the jury box to
circumvent the soap and ballot box is Donald Trump. They tried to remove
him from office in his first term, then rigged the 2020 election to deny
him a second term. When he did not get the message, they used lawfare
against him in the same way we see in Europe, except that Trump managed
to win at the jury box. Note they reached for the cartridge box when
they failed at the jury box.

The assassination of Trump is a good reminder that it is almost always
the case that once either side of the political system reaches the jury
box, one side or the other will reach for the cartridge box. The jury
box is where irreconcilable differences are confirmed to both sides, no
matter the result. The reason there is always the smell of sulfur around
attorneys is not only due to who they serve. It is also because sulfur
is an essential element of gunpowder.

What we see happening in the West is a reminder that the last box in
that formulation is essential to preserve the three other boxes. The
19th century French social thinker, Georges Sorel, explained that
political violence is not a sign of chaos, but a healthy antidote to
political oppression. It is often the creative destruction needed to
free the political marketplace so it can produce healthy politics.
Violence also has the effect of energizing the people to defend their
ancient liberties.

Thomas Jefferson made a similar point in his famous letter to William
Smith from which we get the famous quote, “The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It
is its natural manure.” Jefferson was not justifying political violence
for its own sake. He pointed out that violent resistance is often a
necessary reminder to the ruling class of what lies ahead if they ignore
the soap box and the ballot box. Shays’ Rebellion was a warning and a
promise.

It may be why American oligarchs joined the Trump team. When Luigi
Mangione popped out from behind the car to gun down that insurance
executive, it let every oligarch know the cartridge box remains an
option. If French judges and politicians suddenly come down with lead
poisoning, maybe the poseur class in Paris will suddenly rethink their
position too. If not, then it guarantees the French end up at the
cartridge box anyway.

This is the most likely end for the West as a whole. The Trump reforms
will surely fail, as reform is almost always an effort to relieve the
pressure of general discontent while maintaining the status quo. In
Europe, the ruling class is nakedly hostile to the native population,
hellbent on pulling the roof down to spite the people. They will not be
talked out of their positions, and they will not be voted out of them.
Since the courts are now owned by the managerial class, it leaves the
last option.

The irony of all this is that the great lesson of Western history is
that liberty only comes when the people join to spill blood. As the sun
sets on Western man, this truth is becoming clearer with each outrage by
the ruling class. The people endlessly yelping about “our democracy” are
killing the West. It is only through the blood of these parasites and
vermin that the new Western man will regain his lands and liberty. After
the jury box comes the cartridge box.
