Last week I mentioned the retirement of Pat Buchanan and a few people
suggested doing a show on the man. He looms large for people on this
side the great divide who were around when he ran in 1992. For younger
people on this side he probably does not resonate the same way, simply
because you had to be alive back in the 1980’s and 1990’s to appreciate
the full impact of the event.

The thing is though, even if you were around then, you did not
appreciate what was happening until much later. Trump’s run in 2016 is
what brought it home. Then the monstrous assault on Trump and his
administration reminded some of us of what happened to Buchanan but also
the paleos. The ugly face of the people behind the last thirty years of
American politics came into focus.

When you dive into Buchanan’s career, you appreciate why the paleos
lost, but also why they were never willing to take the next step. They
grew up in an America that was about as close as you get to the ideal of
America. It was a country that prospered because it was a system that
worked. It was not perfect, of course, but it was about as good as
anyone could expect.

Buchanan’s career, starting in the 1960’s, was about trying to get back
to the system which produced the glory years of the 50’s and 60’s. What
made his run in 1992 possible was the flicker of renewal in the 1980’s.
For his generation, that time must have felt like a turning point in the
great return. Then they saw the scaly tentacles of the neocons wrapped
around it.

Digging into Buchanan’s career, prepping for the show, I came to
appreciate why guys like Jared Taylor stop short of criticizing the
system itself or why Steve Sailer pines for a return to his salad days
in California. People who recall good America do not have to think about
an alternative to the present. They lived in one. I do not think we can
return to it, but I appreciate why they would desire it.
