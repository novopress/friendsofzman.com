**Note On Comments:** Many have complained about the number of comments
that end up in moderation. There is not much I can do about it, but one
way to avoid this trap is to avoid certain language like profanity. The
spam filter gets triggered by the colorful use of euphemisms. Links to
images and movies is another trigger. They tend to go right to the trash
bin without hitting moderation.

For at least two decades there has been a debate on the Right, broadly
defined, about how to define America and the citizen. On one side are
the intellectual descendants of Harry Jaffa, who argued America is just
an idea, so a citizen is someone who agrees with that idea. On the other
side are the people who take the view of the Founders who held the
traditional view of nationhood. America is the product of a people who
secured the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity.

A middle ground was staked out twenty years ago by Steve Sailer. He came
up with an idea he called “citizenism” which says “Americans should be
biased in favor of the welfare of our current fellow citizens over that
of the six billion foreigners.” Therefore, “our leaders have a duty to
current citizens and their descendants over the interests of prospective
citizens and their descendants”. This is a definition that allows for
the appreciation of racial differences between the current citizens.

Sailer’s definition is reactive, more than objective. He was trying at
the time to put space between himself and other race realists. He wanted
to talk honestly and openly about racial differences without being
lumped in with people like Jared Taylor, who he considered to be a white
nationalist. Sailer and Jared Taylor had an exchange back in 2005 on
this topic as well as Taylor’s book *The Color of Crime*. Here are some
bits of this debate [here](https://archive.is/qZa1s),
[here](https://archive.ph/boMNf) and
[here](https://www.amren.com/news/2005/09/taylor_vs_saile/).

Fifteen years on, we can look at the three sides of this dispute with
the benefit of hindsight and see who was closer to the truth. The
“nation of ideas” side is looking rather shabby, as the West lurches
into despotism in an effort to keep the wildly diverse population from
destroying itself. The suspension of civil liberties, constant
surveillance and state sanctioned domestic terrorism suggest that the
idea at the heart of this new definition of the nation is
authoritarianism.

Further, the “nation of ideas” concept was always a Marxist notion.
Instead of society being the product of economic relations, the nation
of ideas people define society as cultural relations. This is right out
of the cultural Marxist handbook. The main difference is the Left thinks
that culture is the product of institutions while the Right thinks it is
the product of magic. While both sides are wrong about the source of
culture, the Left was smart enough to seize the institutions.

The traditionalists who claim a nation is the product of a people, held
together by a shared history and kinship have not been proven correct,
but their claims against a nation of ideas is supported by present
reality. Time will tell if the West devolves into tribal camps that
judge their relations with other groups purely through the lens of
tribal self-interest, but that is the current direction. At the minimum,
the Jared Taylor camp was right about identity politics and what is
means for white people.

As far as citizenism, it may be the biggest loser. In his exchange with
Jared Taylor, Steve Sailer wrote, “And yet, this manner of thinking,
this dismissal of objective reality in favor of assessing whose side the
speaker is on, is probably as popular today in America as it was in
Berlin and Moscow in Orwell’s day.” Sailer was comparing Orwell’s
description of Nazism with Taylor’s brand of white nationalism. In other
words, these views contrast with objective reality.

It is turns out that the citizenism can only work if everyone involved
steadfastly and fanatically rejects objective reality. For example, they
must refuse to consider that what leaders will do is not always in line
with what you think they *ought* to do. Further, the “best interests of
the current citizens” is a normative statement, whose definition is
based on the perspective of the speaker. The universalist concept of
best interest at the heart of citizenism is as real as the unicorn.

To some degree, this form of bourgeoise objectivism has always
functioned as a form of escapism where the objectivist gets to be both
right and taboo. In this case, he gets to speak candidly about the human
condition from the perspective of biology but avoid being sanctioned by
the people who must deny this reality. In other words, it assumes there
is an exception to morality, where you can avoid official sanction over
impure thoughts if you can prove those thoughts to be correct.

This is a world that denies the reality of the prevailing orthodoxy,
thus denying objective reality with regards to human relations. Every
society has its moral framework that is rooted in its sense of identity.
This is largely controlled by the ruling class, which is a feature of
every society, regardless of politics. The morality of the people in
charge of the West requires us to deny biology and they make no
exceptions. That is a reality one must accept before engaging in any
analysis of politics.

In the end, Steve Sailer’s approach was rooted in a misunderstanding of
what lies behind things like open borders. It was not a desire for
mundane things like a desire to save the world or a demand for cheap
labor. At the heart of the neoliberal project is the assertion that
humans are infinitely adaptable to their culture. This is the
unequivocal denial of biological reality. This is why citizenism was
doomed from the start. It offered a compromise that could never be
tolerated, much less accepted.

In the end, the nation of ideas side was probably more realistic than
their critics on the biological reality side. They accepted the premise
of cultural Marxism, which is that control of the institutions is what
matters in current politics. They simply lacked the intelligence and
courage to put their ideas into practice. As a result, the West is
headed into the darkness of radicalism. If the West is to survive,
Western man must accept biological reality and the reality of those who
oppose him.
