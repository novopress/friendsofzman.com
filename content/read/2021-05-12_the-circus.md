It is an iron law of the universe that the Left’s favorite right-winger
is whoever currently has his hand on the knife firmly planted in the
back of conservative voters. Nothing titillates the Left more than
seeing one of their imagined enemies giving another imagined enemy the
business. In the Trump years, they were spoiled for choice, as one
“conservative” after another took their turn condemning the evil orange
man. Now that Trump is gone, the party is turning their knives on one
another.

This week the odious Liz Cheney is expected to be removed from her
position as conference chair. She was put in that position because her
father, the warmongering lunatic Dick Cheney, used his connections to
get her in the House and then into the leadership of the conference.
Like all ne’er-do-well children of successful politicians, Liz Cheney
has a serious case of entitlement. Instead of going out with dignity,
she
[embarrassed](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/11/politics/cheney-house-floor-remarks/)
herself one last time with a tantrum on the House floor.

The lefty media, who universally condemned her father as some sort of
Bond villain during the Bush years, is now firmly in the Liz Cheney
camp. She is principled and dignified in her attack on her party and
former leader. The fact that Cheney seems to delight in hating
Republican voters makes her an ideal Republican, as far as the
Washington media is concerned. They are still shaking over the memories
of January 6 when angry bands of Dirt People were patrolling the city.

Liz Cheney, of course, is a hyper-credentialed clodhopper. Left to her
own talents, she would be a schoolteacher or an office frau. She is a
mediocrity born into opulence and then festooned with honors and titles
that she did nothing to earn. Instead of becoming worldly through hard
experience, she became even more narrow-minded and oblivious through her
quick trip through the narrow word of politics. She never learned simple
things like when to keep your mouth shut around the boss.

She is emblematic of what has gone terribly wrong with the Republican
Party in particular and politics in general. Not far behind her on the
way out the door is a collection of loafers and deadbeats planning their
own big drama. A group of has-beens and never-will-be’s have
[alerted](https://archive.is/tVkdi) their friends at the New York Times
that they are terribly vexed at their party. So terribly vexed, in fact,
they will pack up their cubicles and march right out the front door of
the party. Maybe even start a new party!

Politics is mostly about luck. Jimmy Carter is remembered as a terrible
president, mostly because he inherited a bad hand. Reagan is a genius
because he inherited a Fed chief with the skill and guts to fix the
money supply. In the case of the GOP, they are catching a break as the
remaining members of the neocon hive slither away in anger over their
lost status. They cannot win elections with the neocons running the
show, so maybe they can win elections without them.

For their part, the people running the GOP are not a collection of
Machiavellian political geniuses either. They are as obtuse and
dimwitted as the finks. The main difference is they have enough sense to
pretend to like their voters. Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell hate
their voters as much as anyone else in Washington. They just know that
they cannot be public about it. They have no intention of doing anything
for those voters, but they are happy to lie to them about it.

This may be all that is happening here. The party knows that Trump
voters have no appetite for the old school republicanism. They may be
stupid, but they are not that stupid, so sacrificing a dimwit like
Cheney is just a distraction. This is the sort of cost-free effort that
the party prefers. The fact that Cheney and these other idiots are
excited to play the role makes it even easier. McCarthy gets to look
like a hero, chasing the usual suspects out of the temple.

On the other hand, it could be another step in a realignment of the
parties. It is quite obvious that the Democrats plan to be the antiwhite
party. Even though it is currently helmed by white geezers, they see
their future with the dusky hoards. That leaves the Republicans with
only one choice. They have to be the white party. The people running the
party hate this, but reality is not going to yield for them. The best
they can hope for is a mask that makes the reality of their position
less obvious.

On the other other hand, this could just be another chapter in the story
of how an elite populated by dullards pulled the roof down on
themselves. The turmoil in the GOP looks like bliss compared to what is
going on with the other side. In six months of their rule, we have gas
lines, spiraling inflation and a crime wave. The best they can muster is
some giggles and “whoopsie” when asked about it. Their turn at clawing
each other’s eyes out comes this summer, when the troubles cannot be
ignored.

In the grand scheme of things, none of this really matters. The
political system we have can work fine with a European population, but
it will never work in a balkanized majority-minority population from
around the globe. No one in either party has the courage or intelligence
to speak to this reality, so the system will mostly like rattle itself
to pieces over these sorts of issues. Like the band on the Titanic, the
parties will keep doing what they do until they sink below the water
line.
