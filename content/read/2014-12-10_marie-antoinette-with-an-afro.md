<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Simmons" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Russell Simmons</a> is a very rich man. According to
people who study these things, <a
href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-russell-simmons-lets-his-daughters-spend-on-back-to-school-shopping-2012-8"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">he is worth $325 million</a>. That’s
enough to make him a solid member of the Liberal-Democratic elite.
Further, he has been rich for a long time and he has never been poor. He
is the product of the rarest of things, a black two-parent household.
Both parents have jobs in the New York City government. Simmons got rich
thirty years ago peddling
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam_Recordings" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">ghetto filth</a> to young white kids in the suburbs.

The point being that Mr. Russell knows less about the ghetto and typical
black life than my cat. His is a life of private apartments, private
cars and private planes. He knows enough about black life to be able to
peddle black culture to white suburban kids. Other than that, he has
arranged his life such that he has nothing to do with black America.
That’s not stopping him from pretending to be the <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">tribune of the people</a>.

*Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, appeared on CNN last
night on Out Front with Erin Burnett to warn there are more protests
coming if “demands” are not met.*

*We are seeing the beginning of the end of police policing the police,
he added.*

*“On Wednesday, we are going to ask for indictments and list of
achievable demands.” (“We” referring to high profile celebrities and
athletes that share Simmons’ beliefs.)*

*“And America has not seen protests like those that are coming if
justice doesn’t start to come down,” warned Simmons.*

*Simmons told Burnett, “Over 150K cases were brought before the grand
Jury and and only 11 cases didn’t come back with indictments. It’s like
lightening striking the black community over and over and over again.”*

*We need special oversight committees, we shouldn’t leave it to DAs who
work with the police, explained Simmons.*

*Burnett asked, “You don’t feel defeated that has happened again and
again and again?” to which Simmons responded, “We’re going to get
indictments now because America hasn’t seen what’s coming.”*

*“When people understand the injustice properly, the way these
protestors understand it, they’re all going to fight for justice, and
that’s going to change this system.”*

I’ve mentioned before that whites are growing increasingly weary of this
stuff. There’s simply no excuse for it. If you are a young black person
in America right now, the world is your oyster. If you choose to walk
around with your pants down and  playing with yourself like an extra
from a Russell Simmons music video, that’s on you. If you choose to be a
“playah” and get “in the game” then you can look forward to a life spent
in a cage, but it is *your choice*.

If Russell Simmons wanted to bring down the number of incidents of cops
treating blacks poorly, he would stop peddling the filth that has made
him rich. He would stop portraying blacks as feral animals in order to
sell white people his merchandise. But, that would require a degree of
self-awareness Mr. Simmons apparently lacks. His stepping forth as the
tribune of poor black people is like casting Marie Antoinette as the
leader of the sans culottes.
