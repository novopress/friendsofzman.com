particularly wrong in some important ways. This bit is what caught my
attention.

The first thing I think he has very wrong is to call Official
Conservatism an attitude. That’s pretty much the opposite of reality.
Official Conservatism is a collection of policy items held together by a
pose, which is just a sales strategy. Things like low taxes and limited
business regulation are policy goals. The stuffy smugness you see from
big foot conservatives is a pose, a sale pitch they think helps sell
their proposal. It is intended to inoculate them from being called
simple minded by the Progressives.

This is in sharp contrast to the traditional American conservatism which
is, in fact, an attitude or a temperament. It is a set of preferences
that Michael Oakeshott spelled out a million years ago in his essay
<a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/sellick/On%20Being%20Conservative.pdf"
target="_blank">On Being Conservative</a>. “To be conservative is to be
disposed to think and behave in certain manners; it is to prefer certain
kinds of conduct and certain conditions of human circumstances to
others; it is to be disposed  
to make certain kinds of choices.” In other words, conservatism is a
disposition.

This is why Buckley-style conservatism could never outlive its age. It
was tied to a specific set of public polices that only made sense in the
context of the age in which they were conjured. In the Cold War,
business friendly taxes and regulation, along with a muscular defense
policy make perfect sense as a rebuttal to the dominant Progressive
ideology. Once the Cold War ended, the justifications for Buckley-style
conservatism ended. It became a body with no soul to animate it.

That touches on the another error in the Vox post. Buckley Conservatism
did not fail because it lacked an ideological underpinning. It failed
because it had one, or at least tried hard to fashion one, out of the
collection of policy goals we associate with Official Conservatism. As
Russell Kirk observed, “conservatism is the negation of ideology: it is
a state of mind, a type of character, a way of looking at the civil
social order.” Put another way, Buckley built a movement that he dressed
up in the garb of of conservatism.

The attempt to create an ideology that could coexist with a despairing
acceptance of the human condition, meant that the movement would always
be riddled with cracks. Just as important, because it was a political
movement, it was always willing to toss aside that which it found
politically inconvenient. It’s why the Buckleyites purged so many people
over the decades. Guys like Steve Sailer were shipped out because they
were politically inconvenient, not because they were wrong about what
was happening in the culture.

Inevitably, an ideology demands that the adherent accept things that are
in direct contradiction with observable reality. That’s both the
attraction and the defect of ideology. Those with a conservative
temperament were always going to be skeptical of the projects championed
by the Official Right. Public policy is about accepting less than
perfect trade-offs. In the Cold War, the threat of the Soviets enforced
a degree of accommodation. When that ended, the divorce was inevitable.

The interesting thing about what is happening is that the guys calling
themselves “conservative” are fighting against what is, in fact, the
reemergence of the old traditional conservatism. The mild isolationism,
practical nationalism and biological realism are just the old ideas that
were once common in America, before the ideologues gained the upper hand
in the 20th century. All those fringe types the Buckleyites purged,
turned out to be a majority and now the Buckleyites are looking like a
collection of fringe weirdos.

That’s the other thing Vox has wrong. The alt-right is not an ideology
and it is never going to be one. As soon as guys like Vox are able to
create one, it will cease being of any interest to anyone outside it.
The reason this thing they call the alt-right works is that it is not an
ideology. It is just a long series of inconvenient observations repeated
daily on social media and elsewhere. Posting FBI crime stats on Facebook
is not the makings of a mass movement. It is the undoing of one. That’s
what makes it so dangerous.
