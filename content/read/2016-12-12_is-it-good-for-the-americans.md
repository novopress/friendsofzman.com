When I was a kid, I sat and watched the 30 minute ad run by Lyndon
LaRouche during the 1976 presidential election. I don’t remember much
about it, but I seem to recall he accused just about everyone of being
in a conspiracy of some sort. I also recall my mother laughing and
calling him a nut. LaRouche was a crazy Marxist, but I see [he has been
retconned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_LaRouche#1970s) into a
crazy right-winger and anti-Semite. His wiki page reads like it has been
heavily edited by one of his followers.

Anyway, I bring this up because it is what comes to mind when I read
<a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/807650805767544832"
target="_blank">these paranoid postings</a> about how the Russians are
coming to take us away.

I saw that on Sailer’s blog over the weekend, but it is hardly unique
example of the genre. <a
href="http://www.unz.com/item/what-do-jennifer-rubin-and-brett-stephens-have-against-nativism-oh-wait/"
target="_blank">John Derbyshire pointed out</a> that a segment of the
ruling class has gone around the bend with regards to their paranoia
over the Russians. Jennifer Rubin is a very nasty old woman to begin
with, so her paranoid ramblings about Russia and Trump sound
particularly vile and un-American. As soon as you hear people talking
about dual loyalties like that, you can be sure their loyalties are not
with you.

The upside to believing in conspiracies is the same as the belief in
magic. There is no end to how you can use a conspiracy theory to explain
things. Progressives are now telling one another that they did not
actually lose the elections. No, it was Russian hacking. Somehow,
Russian hackers made their candidate into a crook running a shakedown
scheme from the State Department. They also tricked John Podesta into
writing all those e-mails that proved to be so embarrassing.

The neo-cons have decided that their rejection by the American people
has nothing to do with losing wars of choice and flooding the nation
with hostile foreigners. No, “invite the world and invade the world” is
a great policy. It’s those damned Russians and their schemes to
re-patriot their Jewish emigres. You see, the Russians have teamed up
with Trump to engineer a silent coup to seize control of the US
government in the cause of restoring the Czar to the throne.

That is the worrisome thing about this tribal paranoia about the
Russians. The one thing Jews should always try to avoid is elevating the
idea of divided loyalties into the public discourse. The heart and soul
of Western antisemitism is the claim that Jews are disloyal. They put
the good of the tribe above all else and will sell out their country if
it is good for the Jews. The fact that it is pretty much exclusively
Jews ranting about the Russians and leading the opposition to Trump is
not good for the Jews.

But, that does not seem to be sinking in with the neo-cons. This tweet
from the increasingly deranged David Frum is a sad example.

Is there anything worse you can say about a president than he is a
traitor? Critics of Obama used to say that his Muslim sympathies led him
into foolish policy choices like the Iran deal. That’s not really the
same thing, but his defenders were appalled by it nonetheless.
Protestants used to make these arguments against Catholic politicians,
claiming they would be taking orders from the Pope. At least the
motivation there was spiritual.

Frum is saying that Trump and his team are actually foreign agents, on
the payroll of a foreign government. That’s the only way to read what
these people are claiming. They truly believe that Trump and his people
are foreign agents, working with a hostile government against the
interests of America. It is the one thing that can still get you hanged
in this country, thus making it the worst possible crime. Accusing the
next president of this is more than a little over the top.

Never mind the absurdity of the claim. Think about where that leads.
What limits are there on what you can do to stop a traitor from harming
the country? Obviously, you can say anything horrible about them you
like, in an effort to damage them. Would Frum and his coreligionist be
wrong to conspire to harm the Trump administration? Would they be wrong
to cook up a plot to take the guy out before he could get into office?
Maybe run a straw candidate in one state? Or something more?

It’s not hard to see how this gets out of hand. These unhinged
anti-Trump people, by raising the divided loyalty topic, open the door
to a lot of very bad thoughts. These sorts of claims have a way of
washing back on the people who first raise them. That is the lesson of
history. Team Trump looks like a grab bag of American types, that hardly
fits the model of a conspiracy. The people leading the charge with this
Russian conspiracy nonsense, on the other hand, have a lot in common.

That brings us back to LaRouche and his nutty followers. That should be
the destiny of people like Frum, Rubin, Stevens and so on. Most Jews in
America, probably 99%, think these conspiracy fantasies are nuts so they
should go on the offensive. Marginalizing the anti-Trump loons is one
thing that would clearly be good for the Jews and it would be good the
country. Once you start down the road of divided loyalties, you end up
with mob rule and the majority examining every minority for signs of
disloyalty.

That would not be good for the Americans.
