When you start to develop an audience, you inevitably start getting
e-mail and with enough volume you start to see patterns. There are
certain topics that come up every week, regardless of what is happening
in the world. The number one e-mail topic is the recommendation e-mail.
“You should do X” is there every week. Within in that genre, the most
popular category is a post or podcast topic. Within that category the
number one request is regarding money or economics.

One reason for this is the libertarian-to-dissident pipeline. Lots of
people on our side of the great divide were radicalized by
libertarianism. They suddenly realized they were nodding along with a
middle-aged man dressed in a motorcycle jacket. Despite the trauma of
the experience, they brought with them to this side of the great divide
their interest in economics. Old habits are hard to break. People
trained to engage in politics via the topic of economics like to talk
about money.

Another reason economics is popular with many on this side is there is a
logic to the operation of an economy. Most dissidents are empirically
minded, even those who came here through the religion door. Dissident
Christians tend to study Scripture the same way lepidopterist studies
butterflies. There is a base assumption that the universe operates
within a set of rules. Therefore, dissidents like working the puzzle
that is the economics of the modern age.

Of course, economics is downstream from just about everything else, but
it is the easiest to see and the easiest to quantify. The world is
headed to a global recession because the Global American Empire has
declared economic war on a large swath of the world. They also have been
swinging a sledgehammer at the rules that have governed the economy for
the last few decades. This tantrum of economic destruction is going to
occupy our minds a lot in the future.

In the past, I have done shows that touch on the subject of money and
its relationship to politics, but usually within the context of another
subject. Since the “world’s reserve currency” is in the news a lot
lately, I thought a show just on money would be fun and help explain the
current global crisis. There are cultural and historical factors driving
the war against Russia, but money is once again the root of this evil.
The war with Russia is a war over control of global economics.
