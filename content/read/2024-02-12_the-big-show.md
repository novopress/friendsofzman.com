One of the novel things about this age is the role played by carnival
acts in reinforcing public morality and shaping public opinion. With the
exception of ancient Athens, human societies assigned entertainers a low
status. After all, we still have the expression, “run away to the
circus”, even though we no longer have the circus. The idea behind that
expression is you reach such a degraded state that you literally leave
decent society and join the low status world of the circus.

In modern America and the West in general, the circus not only plays a
central role in society, but the circus performers also have enormous
influence. So much so, in fact, the most powerful people want to be
friends with the popular carnies. Every president has a stream of
carnies coming through the White House, often attending state dinners
with important foreign leaders. Carnies have even turned up in Ukraine,
getting a special welcome by the Ukrainian dictator.

Of course, we have just had the biggest circus event on the American
calendar, which is the Super Bowl, the title game of the NFL. According
to the people in charge, almost all Americans stop what they are doing
to watch the spectacle. The Super Bowl party has become something of an
industry. Americans spend over $15 billion on parties that host three
quarters of all adults. Naturally, all the important carnies seek a way
to be part of what is the biggest carnie act of the year.

It is popular to compare the Super Bowl to the Roman games, maybe even
dusting off Juvenal’s line about bread and circuses. There is some truth
to that, but the Roman games were nothing compared to American
entertainment. The games were a distraction for the masses and important
people, but the performers were never treated like the modern celebrity
or athlete. The performers in the arena were low status and important
people made sure they remained so.

This is the great innovation of America. Entertainment has become a
church at which the morality of the day is preached to the audience. It
is easy to see at the Super Bowl, where moral messaging is everywhere.
In the end zones there was a message about ending racism, a hobgoblin of
the modern elites. There were ads about other hobgoblins like
antisemitism, bullying and Gaia. They have your attention, so they make
sure to let you know what you ought and ought not be doing.

Then you have the appeals to unity, by which they mean conformity. At
the start of the game, you get patriotic songs. They even have something
called the “The Black National Anthem*” *which is supposed to shame
whites and remind them they can never be forgiven for the sin of
whiteness. In a prior age, parishioners were told they were at the mercy
of an angry God. Today they are told they are at the mercy of angry
minorities, which is far more terrifying than an angry god.

When these songs are played at the start of the game, the players, who
should only care about winning, make themselves cry and look moved by
the program. This is where you see the supremacy of carny life. The star
players know this game is really an audition for them to join the media
circus or possibly get a brand going so they can be a celebrity past
their playing career. Everyone wants to run away to the circus, even
people already in the circus.

You see the warping power of the circus with the public romance of
Chiefs player Kelce Travis and middle-aged warbler Taylor Swift. She is
a super famous pop star, but she can always be more famous, so dating a
famous sports star, especially one who gets to perform in the big
circus, is good business. The NFL loves it and makes sure to feature
this totally authentic romance in their shows. Any bets on whether these
two love birds manage to build a life together?

All of this is the product of democracy. In theory, democracy is about
convincing fifty percent plus one. In order to do that, you need to get
the attention of the public, which is why celebrity becomes the coin of
the democratic realm. The only way you can have a chance to influence
anyone is by getting on the stage and you do that by getting everyone’s
attention. Carnies live to get attention, so it does not take long
before they take center stage in the democratic process.

It is why our politicians are mostly actors playing a role. The
producers of the political shows are no different from the people who
make movies, television shows or produce extravaganzas like the Super
Bowl. They select people who can play the role, which often means
picking people who will not question the script. Oklahoma senator James
Lankford was picked because he is not smart enough to question things.
He looks the part, and he reads his lines. That is why he is in the
Senate.

It is easy to be critical of mass democracy, but the Super Bowl shows
how powerful it is at controlling the masses. More people care about why
Travis Kelce wore a suit made from garbage bags than the fact Joe Biden
is non compos mentis. More important, it encourages the masses to empty
their wallets in order to see the next show that the ruling elite will
stage for them. Mass democracy is where the ruling elite charge the
masses to be the masses.

For most of human history, carnies were relegated to the fringes of
society because the running of society was too important to do
otherwise. Today the running of society is over on the fringes, in the
shadows where no one looks, because the carnies are now at the center of
society. Maybe this is how the great experiment with participatory
government is supposed to end. The masses think their voice matters, but
in reality, no one cares, just as long as they pay full price for their
ticket.
