One of the unexpected consequences of the information age is that we
have less reliable information, despite have vastly more data. We have
facts about the world now that were unimaginable a generation ago. The
facts of our society are stashed in massive searchable databases that
are accessible to most everyone. You may need some skill to access them,
but the data is there. Even data that should be private is available if
you are willing to pay for it.

In contrast, the information about our world that we can trust has
collapsed into the set of things we can verify on our own. Information
is not the same as data, which is a collection of facts. How many miles
you drive to work every day is a fact. Information is what we can derive
from those facts. If your commute takes an hour and it is 50 miles, we
can conclude that you mostly use the highway to get to work, based on
some simple math using those two data points.

In theory, information should be value free, as it is facts plus
testable logic, with the result being subject to comparisons with the
reality. If the information you derive from someone’s driving data
indicates he is breaking the speed of sound on his way to work, we know
your facts or logic are wrong. The trouble here is that information is
not readily testable against reality. We tend to rely on the reputation
of the person providing the information and how it fits within our own
observations.

That’s the other important distinction between data and information, at
least regarding the way in which these words are used in popular
discourse. While they are often used interchangeably, data is an
objectively true fact, while information is true according to a set of
logical rules. Since those rules can be conditional, information can be
valid and invalid, depending upon those conditions. “All bachelors are
unmarried” is true as long as the word “bachelor” is defined to mean “a
man who has not married.”

This may seem a bit esoteric, but it gets to the heart of the crisis in
the West. For most of human history and all of Western history, the
relationship between data and information was different than we see
today. For medieval man, there was never a lot of data about the world,
but he could trust the information about it. This was not just the
natural world. He could trust the truths about his society, his gods,
the people in charge of his society and the sources of his information.

In the modern age, and really just in the last generation, this
relationship has flipped around the other way. We have all the data we
need for any question. We know more about world than we really want or
need to know. What we lack is information and more important,
trustworthy sources of information. Medieval man could rely on the
Church or the local lord to maintain the rules of society. The only
thing modern man can know about his sources of information is they are
wrong.

Modern man is now awash in both misinformation and disinformation, in
addition to false information. Misinformation is deliberately inaccurate
information, which is intended to deceive. Disinformation is
deliberately inaccurate information, but from an institution like the
state or the media. Of course, false information is information that is
inaccurate due to bad data or logic. Compounding this is the [current
campaign](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22304518/hbo-trailer-upcoming-qanon-movie-disinformation-researchers?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4)
against misinformation and disinformation.

The first thing you should notice is the people most responsible for the
tsunami of disinformation are claiming to be at war with disinformation.
Unless this results in mass suicide by media and entertainment, it means
they are lying. Note also the use of the term “expert” in that piece.
There is no such thing as a disinformation expert, outside of the
institutions promulgating disinformation. One cannot be an expert at
doing something unless you are actually doing that thing.

Note also how the primary sources of both misinformation and
disinformation talk about this phenomenon as if they are the victims of
it. The managerial class is the single source for the flood of false
information. Pranksters may post gags on line to fool people, but the
practical joke has been a part of life since the stone age. The online
version is just an extension of the flaming bag of dog poo. What the
managerial class is doing is a firehose of falsehoods with the stamp of
authority.

Put another way, the new phase of the misinformation/disinformation
tsunami is the managerial state crying out in pain as it strikes the
society over which it rules. The next front in the crisis will be agents
of the state arresting people on trumped up charges, for imaginary
crimes against the state. This is the Douglas Mackey case. An entirely
powerless person is arrested for a crime that does not exist, because
the disinformation system says he was passing misinformation on-line.

Since the first humans began to settle into large communities, human
organization has relied upon social trust, enforced by a code. Social
trust worked in two directions, vertically and horizontally. People
could trust their neighbors because they were like them and accepted the
same codes of conduct. People trusted their rulers because those rulers
enforced the code and attained their positions based on the logic in
that code of society. Trust was side-to-side and up-and-down.

Modern economics is turning the horizontal trust of American society
into cash equivalents and hauling it away to the pirate coves of finance
capital. Americans are living in a world of strangers. The
disinformation campaigns intended to distract from this realty are
eating away at the vertical trust. Americans no longer trust the people
in charge of their society. That distrust is quickly morphing into a
distrust of and contempt for the system itself.

Smart people look at the economic model of America and wonder how it can
keep going on as it is. The fact that it does go on suggests it can keep
going on, but it seems to be violating the rules of the universe. The
same can be said for the collapse of social trust and the growing
contempt for the system. How long can the people in charge expect to
remain in charge when the people over whom they rule are increasingly
convinced the rulers and their system are evil and corrupt?

Perhaps that is the final trick of financialization. The first trick was
to subvert the basic rules of exchange between people. All of those
rules we learned from economics no longer make any sense. The final
trick is to subvert the rules of logic themselves, making it so no one
can believe or trust anything or anyone. The disinformation age is the
final part of the modern prison. Everyone is alone, no one can trust
anything, even the laws of the universe. You just have to do what you
are told.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
