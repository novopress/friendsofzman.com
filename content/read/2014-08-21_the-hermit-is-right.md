The hippies got exactly one thing right. That was dropping out. The
whole “turn on, tune in and drop out” gag was mostly nonsense. Sitting
around getting high all day is no way to live. Hallucinogenics will
certainly make you feel like you are reaching a higher consciousness. 
You’re not. You’re just high. Maybe it is a good idea to get in touch
with yourself and your relationship to nature, but if you need drugs to
do itm odds are you will never really reach your goal.

Dropping out, however, has merit. A great deal of what ails the world is
due to participating in it. Even if that bit of philosophy is nonsense,
active engagement with society brings a lot of misery. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This former hermit probably
had it right the first time</a>.

*A man who lived nearly three decades in the woods now has a job and is
adjusting to life back in society.*

*Christopher Knight, who survived brutal winters in the Maine woods by
stealing food from homes and camps, could graduate from a special court
program as early as this fall, Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan
Maloney said.*

*After serving about seven months in jail, Knight, known as the North
Pond Hermit, was admitted last fall into the program, whose participants
receive treatment and counseling.*

*While in jail, Knight told GQ magazine that he didn’t like the society
he was being forced to re-enter.*

***“I don’t think I’m going to fit in,” he said in the GQ story, which
will appear in the magazine’s September issue. “It’s too loud. Too
colorful. The lack of aesthetics. The crudeness. The inanities. The
trivia.”***

*Knight never fully explained why he disappeared into the woods, telling
GQ that he didn’t have a reason and that it was a mystery to him too. He
committed more than 1,000 robberies while he lived as a recluse, he told
the magazine.*

*Maloney declined to say what job Knight had taken and where he was
living. Members of Knight’s family couldn’t be reached for comment on
Wednesday.*

*Maloney said Knight has done everything that he has been required to do
in the court program and has done a “remarkable job.”*

*“He has been working hard to understand what it takes to become part of
society again,” she said.*

He was better off in the woods.
