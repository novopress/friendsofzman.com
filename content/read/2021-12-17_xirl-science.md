In my youth when we hunted the mammoth and sabretooth, it became clear
to me that a lot of jobs in corporate America are pointless. I was
working at a big company that had to go through a round of layoffs. They
called is *Reduction In Force*, which quickly became RIF. People were
riffed rather than fired or let go. The banality of evil lies in
corporate jargon. As a low level functionary with computer skills my job
was to keep track of who had been riffed by their job function.

The first thing I noticed is management did not seem to know what many
of their positions did for the company. The managers could talk about
their direct reports, but the people creating the titles and roles were
often unsure about the reason the positions were created in the first
place. Most jobs seemed to evolve into an all-around staff assistant
after they were created. Assistant accounting manager was just an office
clerk that worked in a cubicle over in accounting.

The other thing that became clear is the work being done by the people
riffed was not all that important as no one missed it. Some tasks were
moved to other people, but most of it was just busy work that was
eliminated with the person. The 20% cut in office staff did not result
in 20% less work. It just reduced the number of meetings and the volume
of paper moving around the office. The truth was, many of the remaining
jobs were just make work as well.

When you read the work product of the academy, the thing you see right
away is much of it is nonsense busy work. These are people with no
useful skills and nothing to do so they fritter away their time in a
game of make believe. They imagine themselves as academic and
intellectuals. Their specialty is basically a hobby of their own
creation, which is an offshoot of their mentor’s hobby. You could
eliminate the social science and humanities and no one outside the
academy would notice.

The other thing you notice about these nonsense fields is the struggle
to apply these boutique theories to anything resembling reality. Queer
studies makes perfect sense within the extremely narrow scope of
academic queerness. Outside of that narrow scope it makes no sense
whatsoever. Much of what is produced in these pseudo-intellectual fields
– that is a generous description – is a desperate attempt to apply these
crackpot theories to real world situations.

The financial structure of the American university system is unsound and
serious cracks are starting to appear. There has been a 15% decline in
public university enrollments over the last two years. Some of it is due
to the Covid panic, but that is just an accelerant in this trend. The
higher education Ponzi scheme cannot withstand drops in enrollment
without it creating very serious financial problems. Demographics is
only going to make this issue more obvious.

You have to wonder if what lies over the horizon is the biggest
reduction in force we have seen since the collapse of the buggy whip
industry. Colleges will be forced to cut costs and the low hanging fruit
is the nonsense studies. It is not hard to imagine a university system
riffing entire departments. We may be seeing the peak of bourgeois
decadence in higher education. What lies ahead is a massive contraction
that eliminates these sorts of fields entirely.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
