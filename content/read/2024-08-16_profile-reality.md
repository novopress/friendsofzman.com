The great gaslighting operation called the Harris campaign is just the
latest in this evolution of the public space away from practical reality
toward a virtual reality that operates by a new set of rules. The old
public space which was constrained by observable facts and agreed upon
ends is giving way to a new public space that is controlled by
narratives and characters.

This
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7oryXsi8hk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">interview</a> of Mike Cernovich by Tucker Carlson is a
good example of how the public space has changed. Ten years ago, people
would have roared with laughter at the suggestion that Cerno would
warrant national attention. He was nothing more than a weird internet
character. Of course, Tucker Carlson was not “Tucker” at the time either
and no one imagined such a thing was possible.

The character that is now “Tucker” did not ask “Cernovich” about the
many past characters he has played online. There were no questions about
when Cerno was playing a transvestite-curious man in Southeast Asia. His
time as various types of gurus never came up in the conversation.
“Tucker” was happy to interview the character “Cernovich” that exists at
this moment.

What we see happening is that people are now going back into Plato’s
cave, demanding to be strapped to the rocks, so they can enjoy the life
of the shadows, but play some part in creating the shadows. Public life
is becoming an interactive fictional drama that is disconnected from
tangible reality. It is not just a distraction from the reality of life
but supplanting that reality.

That is the show this week. Before you strap in, you may want to double
up on the brain oil as there are some big brain topics in the show. The
links below are worth the time as the philosopher I reference does a
good job explaining his take on this subject. He has coined the term
“prolificity”, which I like, but I am not entirely sure if it captures
the full nature of what is happening to the West.
