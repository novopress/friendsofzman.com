The internet has made it possible for people around the globe to easily
pass information back and forth among one another. This is taken for
granted these days, but it is truly a revolutionary event. Since the
dawn of civilization information spread no
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">faster</a> than a man could run. In the
19th century the train made this process a tiny bit faster then cars and
planes made it even faster in the 20th century, but the internet puts
all of us, if we choose, together in real time.

While this feels like a miraculous development for the curious and
productive, it may also be a curse we are struggling to understand. The
internet puts the smart, curious, and productive people together, but it
also puts crazy people together. That nutty woman in the suburbs who
thinks she is a psychic can now join up with other women who also think
they are psychics. They can form a “community” online where they
encourage and reinforce their delusions.

The apparent rise in the number of pedophiles is made possible by the
ease with which these people can now associate. In the analog days,
these people could not easily collaborate with one another. Those cursed
this maladaptation could not easily access this material and there was
high risk in trying to obtain it. The internet made it easy for these
people to work together to produce and disseminate this stuff. The
curious now find this material after a few clicks of a mouse.

Recency bias is the tendency to overemphasize the importance of recent
experiences or the latest information when trying to understand current
events. The news seems to be full of pedophiles lately, so we think it
is a growing problem. The Left coming out in favor of pedophilia now
certainly adds to the sense that it is a growing issue, so we have to
adjust for that possibility. On the other hand, the number of cases is
<a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/03/10/how-social-media-emboldens-abusers/11413209002/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing</a> at the same time the Left is
celebrating it.

In other words, when it comes to child abuse, the internet is making it
easier for the pedophiles to meet one another, thus increasing the
phenomenon, but the internet is also making us more aware of it. This
increased awareness is made possible by people aware of this trend
easily communicating the particulars. The same forces that allow the
pedophiles to collaborate in their activity allows normal people to
become aware of it and organized to oppose it.

Counterintuitively, the internet is tribalizing society. In the analog
days, the pedophiles were a small and manageable problem. These were
individuals forced to work in isolation and therefore caused the minimum
of harm. Normal people could trust that the odds and the police would
protect them, so they saw no need to know much about this issue or work
with others to guard against it. The internet brought these people
together and they formed two warring camps.

Obviously, the pedophile issue is an extreme example, but relevant due
to corporate America embracing the child molesters over their customers.
The same tribalizing forces unleashed by the internet are most likely at
play here. The beautiful people who make corporate policy now see the
Dirt People everywhere. Whenever they go online, they are confronted by
Trump voters, heterosexuals, white people and all the other demons their
“community” says are evil.

A part of what makes internet tribalization work is that it allows
people with a minority view to interact with others holding the same
view. This reinforces the belief, but also gives them the sense they are
a growing community and therefore their minority view will soon be the
majority view. When disconfirmation appears, these people can trust that
their online pals will find a way to cope with it and thus provide them
a way to not only explain it but reinforce group solidarity.

A good example of this is the recent events in the Ukraine. As events
have gone against Ukraine in the war, online communities create pleasing
alternative realties where their side is on the march. This
<a href="https://twitter.com/TimInHonolulu/status/1659800554867163136"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">guy</a> spends all day everyday
explaining to the likeminded why bad news is actually good news. This
<a href="https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1659954245238681601"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">guy</a> spends his days creating an
alternative reality for the likeminded. These online communities operate
like the UFO cult at the center of this famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> in the 1950’s

T. S. Eliot famously wrote “Humankind cannot bear very much reality.” To
some degree all of us are susceptible to escapism. We want some result,
and we look for information that suggests it is happening. Some people,
of course, go the other way and fear some result and look for
information showing their worst fears are happening. It is two sides of
the same coin and all of us are prone to it. Some people are more prone
than others as belief operates on a scale like all human traits.

In the analog age, the limits placed on the flow of information left the
believer in isolation unless he could physically connect with others.
Joining a cult took effort, which is why so few people joined them. In
the digital age, the internet is full of cults catering to every
conceivable belief. Not only can you connect with thousands who hold
your same hopes and fears, you can get instant confirmation that you are
the good guy, and the rest of the world is the bad guy.

Of course, the internet is making us more aware of this reality. In the
analog days we would have no idea that the [Jewish
guy](https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1662942250618216448)
across the street had a seething hatred for white people, but in this
age we just look at his Twitter profile. Not knowing he hates you made
it possible to not hate him. Knowing that he wants you dead makes it
impossible to not hate him back. The more we know the more aware we are
of the dangers that are lurking around every corner.

Since the dawn of the computer age, people have worried that the
machines would become aware and then set about killing off humanity. The
truth is, that process has already begun, except the machines are not
doing the killing. Instead, they are holding up a mirror to society and
letting us see ourselves. We do not like what we see, so we will find
others who agree with us that we must kill off those other guys. It is
not Artificial Intelligence that will get us, but Artificial
Familiarity.
