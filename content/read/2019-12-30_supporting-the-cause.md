Since we are rapidly running out of road in 2019, it seems like a good
time to address some common questions that come up from time to time.
Something that has gone unnoticed over the last year is the number of
people moving into dissident politics is growing, despite the efforts of
the ruling class. When big shot pundits feel comfortable using terms
like “cloud people” in public, it suggests the people on the other side
of the great divide are at least looking over at what’s happening here.

A question that comes up with some frequency is what people can do to
support the cause of dissident politics. It makes sense. Once you have
come to terms with the fact we are in the demographic age, you want to
support your team. There’s also the fact that people attracted to this
type of politics are the type used to solving problems and fixing things
that are broken. Sitting around bitching about things being broken is
not what comes natural to those drawn to this side of the great divide.

The first rule of organizing is to develop as many on-ramps as possible
for people to come into your thing. The reason outsider politics remains
fringe is it tends to have just one entry point and that door is guarded
by weirdos. The libertarian movement never got out of the valley of
weirdos, because it deliberately disconnected itself from the
mainstream, despite so much help from Conservative Inc. The key is
offering many paths to entry and not being ideological about those
paths.

For example, 2020 is an election year. There are few good candidates
running, but there are some worth supporting. No, they are not “our
guys” and no, winning elections will not result in the changes we seek.
The way forward for us is not going to be through the ballot box, but
elections can open doors to our side. Despite all the screw-ups and
mistakes, Trump has opened a lot of doors for us. Lots of people had
their eyes opened about demographics through the issue of immigration.

If politics is your thing, consider supporting these candidates:

-   Joshua Foxworth:

-   Pete D’Abrosca:

-   Kris Kobach:
    <a href="http://kriskobach.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

-   Steve King:
    <a href="https://www.steveking.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank">https://www.steveking.com/about</a>

Again, there is no voting our way out of the problems of democracy, but
engaging in the process can open doors to our side. A guy like King
winning is social proof to a lot of people who quietly agree with us,
but maybe don’t know it. This was the sole value of Trump winning in
2016 and will be the only value of his winning again in 2020. It
validates the opinions of people who are heading this way. When you
learn that your taboo thoughts are not uncommon, it liberates the soul.

There is another angle to this. If you are in these areas where populist
candidates are running, even if it is a guy running for dog catcher,
volunteer for the campaign. What you will find is that there are other
bad thinkers doing the same thing. These campaigns have become an
underground meetup for people in dissident politics to recruit people
into local groups. If you are in a local group, find a candidate close
to our side and get your guys to volunteer. It’s a great recruiting
tool.

That is, of course, the main thing we should be doing. Getting people of
like mind together in real life is the foundation of any movement. The
story of every successful mass movement is normal people getting
together in real life for fellowship, support and community building. If
you don’t know anyone local, sign up for
<a href="https://www.americanidentitymovement.com/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AIM</a>. They have local
groups all over now. It’s not just young people either. They have men of
all ages in their chapters. It is a good thing to support.

Another way to engage likeminded people in real life is to attend events
where our people meet, like
<a href="https://www.amren.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">American Renaissance</a>. They will be holding their
annual convention in May this year. It has not been announced, but the
tentative date is the last weekend of May. There will be other events
coming up like the Northwest Forum, which is held in Washington State.
There are a lot of plans for events in the works this year and they will
be posted here and elsewhere as the details emerge.

Finally, if the best you can do is throw money at the cause, there is no
shame in that as there is no shortage of donors in this thing. American
Renaissance and <a
href="https://vdare.com/solicitations/vdare-has-been-america-first-for-20-years-now-we-need-your-help"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VDare</a> are two groups that
do a lot for the dissident cause. Solo acts like <a
href="https://www.unz.com/isteve/booze-and-the-muse-why-were-great-american-writers-so-often-drunks/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Sailer</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/ramzpaul" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Paul Ramsey</a> are examples of individuals, who can
always use a few bucks to help keep the lights on and food on the table.
Paying NetFlix every month may ease the pain of your demise, but giving
that money to dissidents may save your kind.

It’s not just about donating to our guys. You can also buy the books
written by our guys, which is is a great way to support our media. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Conservatism-Inc-Battle-American-Right/dp/1912975556/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Conservative Inc.</a> is a
great book by one of our great young writers. It’s a good book to give
to your curious normie friend. If you are into fiction, pick up a copy
of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Faction-Karl-Dahl/dp/1082596450/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Faction</a> by Karl Dahl. For
something witty and funny, there is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Brainset-How-Like-Intellectual-ebook/dp/B07LC3YCVQ/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Galaxy Mindset</a>. <a
href="https://www.counter-currents.com/category/counter-currents-title/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greg Johnson</a> has a lot of
books for the dissident reader and he can always use our support.

Of course, the best thing you can do, the most important thing you can
do, to support the cause is be a prince among men in your daily life.
Men follow men. By setting a high standard in your personal life and
being a respectable face to skeptical people about these issues, you
become one of those many on-ramps to our thing. If you are the sort of
person people admire, they will admire your politics. The reddest red
pill is the realization that you are the message. Never forget it.
