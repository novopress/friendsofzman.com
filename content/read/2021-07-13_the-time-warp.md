One of the weird things about this age is how certain groups of people
remain locked in a form of psychological stasis. Their views of the
world remain the same as they were at some point in the past. For some
it is always 1985 and the biggest fear is the commies will get control.
Some are locked in 1968 where they are trying to keep corporate
interests from crushing the working man. These people live like modern
people, but their worldview remains in the world of the past.

From the perspective of dissidents, the most obvious of these groups are
the civic nationalist types. Long time users of Gab have suddenly been
made aware of these folks after Trump and Trump fans were dumped from
Twitter. The J21’er is a person who signed up for Gab in January of
2021. They decorate their profile with patriotic symbols and far too
much information about themselves. Politics for them is right out of a
civics textbook from the late 1980’s.

These people are not just lost in the past. They have plenty of examples
in the media who are right there with them. This <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/where-are-american-conservatives-headed/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in the American Conservative is
a good example of the type. It is a long piece about the future of
conservatism that reads like it was written in 1992. No mention of
immigration, the  most important issue facing the world at this time. No
mention of race and racial politics, which has convulsed the country
since the end of the Obama administration.

The writer is a regular at the site so it is safe to assume his views
reflect those of the editorial staff. It links to many other sites that
wave the conservative flag, so it is in tune with the sensibilities of
that old tribe. This is the right world to use as they exist like an
isolated tribe in the Amazon, unaware of the world that exists outside
their remote villages.
<a href="https://isi.org/lectures/future-of-conservatism-debate/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This</a> is one of the links in the post.
It is a debate about conservatism by people who should be in a museum
exhibit about the 1990’s.

It is not just a phenomenon of the legacy Right. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BreadTube" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">BreadTube</a> phenomenon is an example from the Left
that parallels the one on the Right. These are people promoting things
like socialism, communism and anarchism, but from the perspective of the
1970’s when such topics were actually discussed by adults. They want to
steer young people away from identity politics, but they also want to
combat what they call “far-right extremism” that appears on YouTube and
other places.

This is where you see the time warp. The people they consider to be
far-right are people like Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson. Not only that,
they stick to an old 1970’s liberal view of politics when the Left was
sure their ideas were so convincing, they could engage with their
opponents and win every time. Like their analogs on the other side, they
seem to have missed the last couple of decades. They are unaware of the
fact that people get fired from their job for holding the wrong
opinions.

Of course, the establishment Left itself is trapped in a time warp. The
people banging on about structural racism and white supremacy also bang
on about the dangers of corporate media and corporate power. They do so
on global corporate platforms, often from the corporate offices. If
people actually wore the labels of their supporters, the street
protestors would look like NASCAR drivers. Their little outfits would be
festooned with corporate sponsors. “This riot brought to you by Amazon!”

Listen to the people behind the Critical Race Theory stuff and they
carry on as if it is 1955 and the imaginary Jim Crow stuff is real. They
claim to be fighting the racism of whites and the oppression of the
white power structure. They are weirdly unaware of the fact that none of
this ever existed or exists today. Everyone with the least bit of power
is on their side. Their people they are attacking are without any
representation in the halls of power. For the antiwhites, time stopped
in 1968.

Some of this is just human nature. People stubbornly cling to old ways
of thinking about things out of habit. There were still supporters of
the Whigs long after they had disappeared into the past. Ideology
provides structure and a way to understand the world, so abandoning it
is difficult for some. Until they find a suitable replacement, they
stick with the old views. We see this with the Trump phenomenon. Many
jumped on it simply as a way out of conservatism.

Then we have demographics. White people are the oldest tribe in tribal
America now, so whites are going to be slower to adapt to the new
reality. The fans of Ben Shapiro are old people mostly. He is what they
hoped the future would be like and what they imagine it was like in
their past. For someone who is 70 years old, it is tough to accept that
all they fought to preserve will be washed away. The dream of returning
to the civic nationalist paradise is better than facing present reality.

Reality is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing it.
The people locked in these time warps will eventually return to this
part of the timeline. Again, you can see this on Gab. Many of those
J21’er have quickly adapted to their new home. Every time a bell rings a
new dissident is born and every day the bells are ringing, thanks mostly
to the behavior of the ruling class. The behavior of the government the
last year has collapsed many of these time bubbles.

Something similar is happening on the Left.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tytcomedy" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Jimmy Dore</a>, for example, is a man who considers
himself on the Left. Yet, he is every bit as skeptical about the
radicals as the typical dissident.
<a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a> is another good example.
<a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Matt Taibbi</a> is another guy who is having an
awakening. These are people looking around and coming to the realization
that their old views on things no longer track with reality. The old
Left is starting to have their own red pill moment.

Political transformation is like the old line about bankruptcy. It is
slow at first, often glacial, then it happens all of a sudden. The
individual begins to break free from their time bubble and then all off
a sudden they have their awakening. As is always true about the behavior
of people, some are too timid to look up. They fiercely cling to their
ole ideas like a dog with a bone. Their fight to remain trapped in the
past is a weird sort of conformation. Some people will just be lost to
time.
