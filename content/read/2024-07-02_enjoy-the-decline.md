British Prime Minister Harold Wilson supposedly said that a week is a
long time in politics, and we have certainly seen that recently. The
documents case against Trump in Florida has continue to unravel as the
government had to admit that they faked those photos of documents lying
on the floor. The Supremes just handed Trump a huge win in the case
brought against him over January 6, which came after the other ruling
from the Supremes on the other January 6th cases.

Of course, sandwiched in between the legal triumphs was one of the most
shocking debate performances in history. Biden’s Captain Pike look was
not just bad in the conventional sense of bad debate performances. It
made people want to turn away as it looked like an act of cruelty. It
was made worse by the reaction of the media and the chattering classes.
They went rocketing off demanding a new zombie to lead the fight against
Trump only to find they are fresh out of zombies.

Things are looking good for team Trump. He is up in the polls and his
opponent looks like he will drop over dead at any moment. The regime
media is melting down and fighting with one another, rather than
attacking Trump. It was one of the unremarked aspects of the debate, but
a critical one. The moderators had to put all of their energy into
helping Biden, so they had no time for their usual shenanigans. Trump
was able to coast through unscathed.

The trouble for Trump is the election is still months away. The polls
are looking better now, but nothing like one should expect. This
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">538 simulation</a> has it a coin toss,
which means Trump is the clear favorite. You have to assume the people
running 538 have their thumbs on the scale. Even so, the fact that Trump
is not up by forty points over a man who is half dead speaks to the core
issue. That issue is the problem of America’s demographic collapse.

Here is a bit of math to illustrate the problem. In the past election,
the breakdown by race was in line with past trends, despite the
shenanigans. That means the percentage of the voters identifying as
white had declined, while the nonwhite percentage continued to climb,
especially the Hispanic share. Whites were 67% of the vote, while blacks
remained at 13% and Hispanics are now at 13%. Here is what the vote
would have looked like if everyone voted for either Trump or Biden.

Biden got 51.3% of the popular vote and Trump got 46.8% of the popular
vote, so Biden lost more votes than Trump to third party candidates and
none of the above. It should not take a mathematician to see the
problem. Trump’s nonwhite vote is just 18% of his total vote and the
ceiling is extremely low. He can bump it up a little with the black
vote, but blacks see Republicans as the white party. Hispanics see the
Democrats as the free stuff party, so the ceiling there is probably 40%.

The main problem for Trump or any Republican is that the white vote is
shrinking and shrinking quickly as the baby boomers begin to age off. In
2016 the white vote was 70% of the total vote and in 2012 it was 72%. In
the 1980 election 88% of the voters were white which is why the claim
that we are going through a repeat of the 1970’s is wishful thinking by
old people. Regardless, the white vote will be even smaller this time,
which means Trump needs even more of it to win.

None of this is new math as it has been posted here many times, but the
point is to explain how it is still possible for Trump to lose to a
corpse. We are reaching a point where the only way a candidate
representing the white middle-class can win the White House is if he
gains the maximum share of the white vote. That maximum share is 80% as
roughly 20% of whites suffer from high mutational load. These are the
spiteful genetic defects we call the left.

Of course, there is a lot of time between now and November. The recent
setbacks at the Supreme Court probably mean Trump gets jail time next
week. In her dissent in the immunity case, Sotomayor spoke for the
entire kook community when she said Trump could start randomly
assassinating people once back in the White House. For kooks like the
judge in the New York case, this means he must use any means necessary
to stop the evil orange man from becoming dictator.

In other words, in a week the dogs will bark, and the caravan will move
on from Biden’s death shuffle to Trump facing jail time. The regime
media will have gotten the memo to stop talking about Biden and refocus
on Trump. The fake pollsters will be churning out new fake polls, while
the gremlins are printing off ballots. The point is the die is cast and
there is no salvation at the ballot box. The most we can expect is some
entertaining moments as we sink under the weight of demographic reality.
