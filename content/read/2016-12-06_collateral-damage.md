One of the unintended consequences of a world of floating exchange rates
has been the geometric growth of debt. The total amount of debt in the
world currently sits at around $300 trillion, which is about three times
the global GDP. That seems like an impossibility, but the value of all
assets on earth is estimated to be around $300 trillion, which means
every bit of potential collateral is pledged to someone, somewhere in
some fashion. The world is literally drowning in debt, you could say.

Of course, those are just guesses. Some debt is actually listed as both
an asset and a liability. Your mortgage is most likely in some sort of
synthetic financial instrument as an asset against which there is some
form of debt. Government bonds are used for collateral, as they are
often considered the most reliable and trustworthy asset on earth. Banks
soak up US debt, for example, because it is worth more to the bank than
their cash deposits, as they can quickly package bonds into other
financial transactions like repo agreements.

It’s also why the US government has no trouble finding willing lenders,
despite having record debt and deficits. Those lenders are holding cash,
which is not as valuable to them as the bonds. It’s not just the US
government. The Germans also enjoy high demand for their debt. In
Europe, the German Bund is the preferred collateral in finance
transactions. In fact, it is so valuable, there is a shortage of it. The
result is there is always pressure on the European Central Bank to not
hold Germans bonds.

It is an important thing to understand about the world of modern
finance. It is entirely driven by debt. When company X wants to do a
deal, it does not reach into its cash reserves to finance the
transaction. Instead, it will pledge an asset in a repurchase agreement.
This is where it agrees to sell the asset to another party, but
simultaneously agrees to buy it back at some point in the future at a
fixed price. This is a modern form of pawning the wife’s wedding ring.
The company gets the cash and the lender gets interest.

Of course, no tree grows to the sky, but <a

What all that means is the modern financial system has come to rely so
heavily on government debt that governments cannot issue enough of it.
The trouble is, government debt can take cash from the economy. This is
fine when the economy is overheated or there is inflation. Central banks
can step in and sell their bond holdings to soak up the excess cash.
That’s not the case today anywhere in the world. Instead, governments
are looking to boost the retail economy by getting more cash into the
system.

The result is an unsolvable conflict. On the one had we have a financial
system demanding ever more high quality debt, in order to drive growth
in asset values. On the other hand, we have a retail economy demanding
more cash moving around in the system in order to stimulate economic
growth. <a

financial crisis in the near future. The methods to paper over this
inherent conflict are just a delaying action. At some point, the
pressure exceeds the restraints and you get a crisis.

An organized unwinding of trillions in debt is never going to happen, so
that means we will have a disorganized unwinding of trillions in debt.
That’s the definition of a crisis. It is the unexpected, disorganized
unraveling of something that probably should never have been allowed to
happen. The mortgage crisis is the most recent example. Lending billions
to people, who have no way to repay the loans, turned out to be a bad
idea. In the fullness of time, the mortgage crisis will be seen as a
warning, one everyone ignored.
