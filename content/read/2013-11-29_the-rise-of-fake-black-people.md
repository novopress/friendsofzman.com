Pop culture is all around us, but I notice very little of it. My
television is for watching sports when time permits. Maybe I turn it on
if there is a big news event. Otherwise, I would not own one. I do watch
a car show from time to time, but I don’t think that qualifies as pop
culture. Movies are just as foreign to me. I rented a few for the
holiday weekend. All had been released last year or earlier and I know
few of the actors staring in them.

When it comes to music I am completely ignorant of what is current. Last
night, looking for the football game, I bumped into a show featuring a
sad looking Elton John and a hideous looking woman on stage playing
piano. The TV said the show was Lady Gaga & The Muppets. Poor Elton
appeared to have two black eyes, so I assume they had to beat the hell
out of him in order to get him on stage with the ugly woman.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">When I saw this on Drudge</a>,
I had to google the name
“<a href="http://www.kanyewest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Kanye West</a>” in order to learn why he is famous. I’ve
heard the name, but I only know he married the Armenian women with the
big butt, who is the current Paris Hilton. He is a singer, most likely
of hip-hop, therefore he cannot sing without electronic enhancement. His
skill is pretending to be from the ghetto in a way that gets elderly
Jewish men excited. That way they can sell his crap to suburban white
boys, who think it is cool to be an underclass black guy.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West#Early_life"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Using Wiki</a>, I see that
Kanye is about as authentically black as I am. He was born to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Tenth"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">talented tenth</a> parents. He
was raised by a mother who was a college professor. Some portion of his
childhood was spent in China. All of his childhood was around upper
middle-class types you see around universities. My guess, given the
background of his father, is that his parents were communists or
Marxists. When that fell out of fashion they went onto other fads. Kanye
West is pretty much a lyrical Barak Obama.

The point here is that West’s parents built their lives around pleasing
upper class white liberals and Kanye was blessed with the same skills.
Instead of black power he sells hip-hop to the little white boys and
girls. It’s a weird sort of exploitation. On the one hand, he is
trivializing black culture by turning it into a commodity. On the other
hand, that commodity he is selling is intended to destroy white culture
by injecting the worst habits of black culture like drugs, degeneracy
and cultural nihilism.

This seems to be a common theme with famous black people. There are
plenty of whites and Jews who start from humble beginnings and make it
big in pop culture. Blacks, even in areas like hip-hop, most often come
from middle-class families and middle-class lifestyles. They make their
money pretending to be a type of black person in public, but live like
Victorians in private, mostly surrounding themselves with whites from
their class.

The fat Armenian woman he married is from a wealthy real estate family.
Maybe the family money came from something else, before they got into
the real estate game, but the point is they have been rich for a long
time.  Kanye West  was not hooking up with a shorty from the
neighborhood when he picked here from the list. Instead he went with a
rich white girl, who was probably like the girls he grew up around as a
kid. He probably finds typical black women to be bitching and stupid,
like the rest of us.

This is nothing new. The dawn of pop culture was Jews selling black
music and black culture to middle class white kids. The popular stars of
the 30’s and 40’s stole much of their acts from blacks. They
white-washed it so it was not obvious, but they were peddling black
culture. In the 50’s and 60’s it became explicit and eventually blacks
were allowed to get in on the act. The formula was the same, even when
blacks got on stage doing their thing in the raw. Rich whites selling
black culture to middle class white kids.

That’s the great change in the last two decades. Instead of Jews selling
black culture through well-behaved blacks, the well-behaved blacks are
selling black culture. In the old days, the black performers chaffed
under the rules, often getting themselves in trouble by being too
“authentic” which meant too black. Today, the black performers chaff at
having to be too black because otherwise they would resemble something
closer to a British colonial officer. That’s why Kanye West blurts out
rants about Jews. To look real.
