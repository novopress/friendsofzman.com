An interesting bit of subtext to the assassination of the United
Healthcare CEO is how the reactions to it reflects the shifting politics
in America. Twenty years ago, the general reaction online would have
been what you see in television police dramas. The vast majority of the
public would have been cheering on the police as they searched for the
killer, while his family was paraded in front of the cameras. The dead
guy would have been the unquestionable victim of a terrible crime.

On top of that, the people we call conservatives would have been
waddling about in their comfort fit chinos, beating their chests about
crime and the demonization of capitalism by the people we call the left.
As soon as it was clear that the perpetrator was a white male, the
people we call the left would have been tub-thumping about the need for
gun control and maybe white male violence. Both sides would have done
their act in front of predictably adoring audience.

Both sides have tried their normal act, but the world has changed and
that means the audience is not as interested in the old shows. The
people we call the left got this right away and stuck to giggling about
the victim being the head of one of those evil health insurance
companies they have been demonizing for decades. They were sure the
killer was one of their own, due to his wearing a dark hoodie. In fact,
a lot of people in the dissident camp assumed it was an Antifa too.

Based on the news reports, we can eliminate Antifa from the story. The
guy they arrested has “pepe” in his social media profiles and is a fan
of Uncle Ted, the avuncular character knowns as the Unabomber. While it
is unlikely that he is “our guy”, he is clearly a young man who escaped
the old political paradigm. He does not fit the left’s version of a hero
or the right’s version of a villain. He has become a bit of a folk hero
for many of the people who voted for Trump.

That last bit is what is vexing to the right-wing influencers. Their
script does not have a section for this sort of character. The main job
of conservatives is to celebrate and defend corporate power, but the
bulk of their audience has long ago become fed-up by the abuses of
corporate America. It was not the government banning them from the
internet or cancelling their bank accounts. It is not the government
race-swapping cultural content or running ads in favor of buggery.

There you see the big change in attitudes that is vexing legacy
politics. For the last decade or so, it is the people we call the left
who have been cheering on corporate America as they made war against our
rights. The people we call conservatives sat silently as this went on.
The CEO of United Healthcare could have been an anarcho-capitalist for
anyone knows, but for the general public, he is the faceless symbol of
corporate greed and avarice. People have had enough of it.

This case also reveals that the old American love of the outlaw is still
there, buried under the piles of corporate slop. As the great Southern
bard observed, outlaws touch the ladies somewhere deep down in their
soul. America is a woman, so she has always had a love for the outlaw.
The reason for that is the old frontier sensibility tells us that
sometimes, you need the outlaw, because sometimes, a man needs killing
and you cannot do that within the law.

That ties in neatly with the whiff of revolution in the air. The
election of Donald Trump and the apparent acceptance of it by the
political class has people thinking about more than just “owning the
libs” in an election. To a lot of people, the bad guys look scared right
now and this event feels like a nice reminder to them that there are
worse things than losing an election. If the 2016 election was a warning
to the ruling class, then the 2024 election is the final warning.

There is another angle here. The people we call the left have been
demonizing health insurance companies for a long time. In typical
booshie fashion, the rhetoric has gone well beyond factual criticism.
Since Hillary Clinton waddled onto the stage, the left has been calling
healthcare companies parasites that must be destroyed. Logically, it
means the people running them are evil parasites who must be destroyed.
Inside the real halls of power, people are making the obvious
connection.

What the 2024 revealed is there has been a shift in the economic elite.
Some members have figured out that there is real danger for them, and
they backed Donald Trump and continue to back him as he prepares to take
power. Elon Musk is not bunkmates with Trump by accident. This will not
be a repeat of the first administration. Some members of the economic
elite want reform because they do not want to be on the wrong end of the
next viral assassination video.

In other words, it is not just the change in public attitudes that has
the chattering classes vexed, but also the change in the economic elite.
The killing of that CEO kicked over more than just the rock of public
opinion. It revealed the growing angst of the economic elite in response
to changing public opinion. Even though it was just one young man on a
mission, it is a reminder that history has often pivoted on one man or
one event, setting off a chain of events.

When the desires of the economic elite align with the desires of the
populace, things can start happening in a hurry. That is the conclusion
of this big <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> on how policy is formed in
America. A decade ago, researchers discovered what has been obviously
true since the dawn of time. Every society has an elite and they
generally get what they want, despite public attitudes, but they always
get what they want when they are on the side of the people.

This is why the chattering classes are struggling with this story. It is
why they will put the whole thing on ignore now that the killer has been
caught. They have been selected and trained to play particular roles in
an old show, but now the curtain is falling on that show, so they must
scramble for parts in the next show. The reason for that is the audience
has changed and now the producers are changing along with them. Luigi
Mangione put a bullet in all the old acts.
