**Note:** I have a
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/power-of-the-puritans/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanksgiving themed post</a>
up at Taki this week. I have a long essay in my long promised on the
subject of the Puritan Question. This a small taste.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An iron rule of the universe is that anything that has value will
inevitably be forged or stolen, usually both. This is especially true of
elections, because the election promises to bestow the most valuable
thing of all to the ruling class. Elections give the ruling class
legitimacy. As a result, every American election has had irregularities.
Whether it is the Democrats calling out the dead vote or Democrats
busing in illegal’s to vote in the suburbs, Democrats have been gaming
elections since forever.

This most recent election may set a record for irregularities. It is
hard to know if the claims being made by Trump are real. Trump’s track
record on truth telling is not great, but even putting his claims aside,
this election has more strange angles than any election in American
history. Too many states have had ballots magically appear in the middle
of the night or last minute rule changes that favor one side. When this
happens in the third world, the West demands new election.

Here’s a bit of data that should jump off the page. In the modern era,
no incumbent that has increased his vote total from the previous
election has lost. Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and Bush all won
reelection by increasing their vote total from their first election
victory. Obama saw a slight down turn in his vote total, but his 2008
victory was landslide. Trump increased his vote by 17% over his 2016
total, 73,763,979 versus 62,984,828, yet his vote share declined and he
lost.

To call this unprecedented is a wild understatement. A contested
election between two new candidates generates a lot of interest.
Elections with an incumbent are referenda on the person holding the
seat. If people are happy with him, his vote total goes up. The voters
now have more certainty about the man. If the voters are not happy, then
his vote total goes down, as people who voted for him sit out or vote
against him.

What the vote totals are telling us this time is that millions of people
who did not vote for Trump in 2016 either came out to vote for the first
time in their life in 2020 or switched from opposing him to supporting
him. Yet, despite millions being happy with his term in office, millions
more were so outraged that they came out of nowhere to vote against
Trump. The improbability of this is hard to overstate.

This brings up probably the most absurd anomaly in election history.
According to the official narrative, Joe Biden brought in close to 15
million new voters. The last four elections saw the following vote
totals: 121,056,394, 129,390,000, 126,035,116,   128,824,246. The vote
total for 2020 was 153,548,144. If we net out the 11 million extra who
voted for Trump, we are being told that the vibrant and exciting Joe
Biden, a man who could not win a primary, added 15 million new voters.

Everywhere else in life, an extreme outlier is a red flag that warrants
investigation, because it suggests something unexpected has happened. If
a sprinter shows up at an international event and runs a sub-nine second
100-meters, his life will be torn apart on the assumption he is
cheating. If it snows in July, people are going to wonder if the gods
are angry at us for some reason. When things don’t follow the normal
patterns, people naturally wonder why. Can you spot the oddity here?

Now, the claim will be that the public was so outraged over the terrible
Donald Trump that people who had never voted came out to vote for Biden.
The plausibility of that claim is undermined by the fact that we have no
example of this. The pattern is that the unpopular incumbent sees his
voters either stay home of vote against him. Carter lost 13% of his vote
in 1976. Bush lost 20% of his vote in 1992. We’re supposed to believe
that Trump increased his vote by 17% because people were angry?

Compounding all of this is the fact that exactly no one found evidence
of this in their polling in the run-up to the election. It is one of the
things that pollster try to gauge when doing a poll. How enthusiastic
are the voters for each guy? Trump had a big lead in enthusiasm, which
was obvious in the final weeks. He was speaking to massive rallies,
while Biden was speaking to empty parking lots. Apparently, those
enthusiastic Biden voters really went out of their way to conceal
themselves.

Of course, the basic vote totals make the post-election analysis about
why Trump lost sound rather ridiculous. You cannot seriously claim he
failed to appeal to his voters in some way when he increased his vote
total by 17%. That means we have to believe that an 80-year old dementia
patient inspired millions to vote for the first time, because Trump did
not appeal to his base enough. That’s the sort of logic you get from
people who want attention, not answers.

Now, we will hear a lot about the “Tucker Carlson standard” where any
questioning of the system must include incontrovertible proof. That is
just an effort to create a false dichotomy in order to avoid explaining
the weird anomalies about this election. Where the facts lead us is to
shift the burden of proof. The principle of parsimony says that
something very unusual went on during the voting and counting process.
It is on the defenders of the process to explain what happened.
