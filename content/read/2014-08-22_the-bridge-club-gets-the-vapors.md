There is a lot to dislike about libertarians. In fact much of what makes
libertarianism unpleasant is libertarians. Even so, there are some
laughs to be had. This post as Marginal revolution is a good example.

*Maybe less than you thought, at least after adjusting for other
variables. The Economist reports:*

*In Sweden the age of criminal responsibility is 15, so Mr Sariaslan
tracked his subjects from the dates of their 15th birthdays onwards, for
an average of three-and-a-half years. He found, to no one’s surprise,
that teenagers who had grown up in families whose earnings were among
the bottom fifth were seven times more likely to be convicted of violent
crimes, and twice as likely to be convicted of drug offences, as those
whose family incomes were in the top fifth.*

*What did surprise him was that when he looked at families which had
started poor and got richer, the younger children—those born into
relative affluence—were just as likely to misbehave when they were
teenagers as their elder siblings had been. Family income was not, per
se, the determining factor.*

*That suggests two, not mutually exclusive, possibilities. One is that a
family’s culture, once established, is “sticky”—that you can, to put it
crudely, take the kid out of the neighbourhood, but not the
neighbourhood out of the kid. Given, for example, children’s propensity
to emulate elder siblings whom they admire, that sounds perfectly
plausible. The other possibility is that genes which predispose to
criminal behaviour (several studies suggest such genes exist) are more
common at the bottom of society than at the top, perhaps because the
lack of impulse-control they engender also tends to reduce someone’s
earning capacity.*

*The original research, by Amir Sariaslan, Henrik Larsson, Brian
D’Onofrio, Niklas Långström and Paul Lichtenstein is here, here is how
the authors report the conclusion:*

*There were no associations between childhood family income and
subsequent violent criminality and substance misuse once we had adjusted
for unobserved familial risk factors.*

There seems to be a trend in economics to take all controversial topics
over to Scandinavia if possible. If it is race related, then South
Africa is the place. Neither place is representative of anywhere else on
earth. Sweden has one of the lowest crime rates on the planet. Maybe
that’s why a lot of crime studies done by economists are done in Sweden
or Norway. There are so few criminals, the researchers can pretend they
are casting a wide net.

It also avoids the big taboos. Black crime is different from white
crime. For instance, whites commit far more sex crime than blacks.
Assault is also more common with whites than blacks. On the other hand,
blacks commit many more murders. It gets even more thorny when you look
at theft. Whites and blacks both prefer to rob white people, for
example. When you bring Hispanics in to the mix, it gets more dangerous,
because not all Hispanics are the same, no matter what the left claims.

As far as what causes crime, people have known since human settlement
that criminals cause crime. There’s no fun in that as it takes real
science and real intellect to tease out why criminals are criminals.
You’re not doing that with Excel or a statistics program you barely
understand. That leaves no room for economists to gas-bag about it.
