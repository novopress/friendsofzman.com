One of the funny things about doing what I do here is that I often
stumble onto things that get no play in the press, but are on people’s
minds. I’ll write about a topic that interests me, but is not in the
news, and it will get a ton of comments and links back from people
passing it around. Our side of the great divide tends to have a
different focus than what you see in the above ground world, but not
always. Sometimes, the stuff on our mind at the moment, regarding
current events, is on their minds too.

The topic of last week’s podcast is a good example. I did not think it
would be all that interesting to people, but I was wrong. I got a lot of
long e-mails from people about what they are doing in their community.
I’ve also seen postings in the so-called conservative media about the
topic this week. It turns out that a lot of people are thinking about
how and why they should be joining and building local communities, where
the likeminded can socialize and talk about this stuff.

Thinking about it, I suspect the reason is lots of people are looking
around at what’s happening and coming the conclusion that the wheels are
coming off the cart. What’s happening in Washington is an insurrection.
The normal order is no longer respected by the people who are supposed
to maintain order. Instead, the political establishment is in open
rebellion against the very laws that make it possible for them to be an
establishment. How many clicks before there are tanks in the streets?

It’s not just Washington. That story of the Mormon group getting
ambushed over the border resonates with people. It would be one thing if
they were in the Congo or down near the isthmus. That’s far away and
people can imagine it is savage. The border is their backyard, literally
and figuratively. People can imagine that spilling into their towns and
neighborhoods. Not only is our government doing nothing about it, the
establishment celebrates it. Their indifference is breathtaking.

At various times in my life I have been in situations where things go
sideways and the normal order breaks down. The white people, for reasons
they never consider, just show up where they think they need to show up,
ready to take direction, lend a hand to restoring order and helping
those who need help. It is our nature and why civilization exists in the
first place. That is maybe what we are seeing. The collapse of normal
order is getting people to seek out their neighbors and start figuring
out what to do.

I’m not in the camp that thinks there will be a sudden collapse and we
will be thrown into a war of all against all. Instead, I think decline
is like an uneven staircase, where society takes small imperceptible
steps down, then a big step or two and then some more little steps
again. Just as progress is fits and starts, regress is fits and starts
too. We could be about to hit one of the bigger steps. A year from now,
the current year will feel like a foreign country. There is nowhere to
go but down.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
