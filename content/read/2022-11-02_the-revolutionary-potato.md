In his essay, *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon*, Karl Marx
famously described the French peasantry as a sack of potatoes. This was
in response to calls from fellow socialists and anarchists to focus on
radicalizing the peasants. At the time this was a big topic of debate
among European radicals. One camp thought the peasants held great
revolutionary potential as a class, while the other camp thought the
urban workers were the only revolutionary class.

The title of the essay refers to the Coup of 18 Brumaire in which
Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in France, linking it to the French coup
of 1851 in which Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte assumed dictatorial powers. In
addition to the topic of the peasantry, Marx was discussing current
events in the context of the history of revolution in France and the
future of the socialist revolution. That last bit was the main concern
of his intended audience of socialist radicals.

As far as the peasantry of France, Marx observed that they formed an
enormous mass whose members lived in similar conditions but “without
entering into manifold relations with each other.” As small independent
farmers, “their mode of production isolates them from one another
instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse.” These small farmers
lived independent from one another, despite being organized into
villages. In this way they were like a sack of potatoes.

What Marx was getting at was the sense of identity among these small
landowners versus the sense of identity among the urban working class.
Unlike the proletariat, the peasant had a sense of independence that
defined his relationship with his fellow peasants and his relationship
with the state and society. The peasants lacked the sense of
togetherness and commiseration of the industrial workers, as they did
their work as individuals for their own purposes.

There was something else that made the peasants a tough nut to crack as
far as the socialist revolution was concerned. Because they owned
something, they had something to lose, which made them risk adverse.
Unlike the urban worker, the peasant was unwilling to break with
tradition or custom. According to Marx, this is why they supported
strong men like Napoleon Bonaparte and Louis-Napoléon. A strong state
was good for their narrow interests.

This insight into identity has remained a part of Marxist thinking to
this day. The post-Marx culturalists that now run the West are always
scanning the fields for identity groups that they view as
anti-democratic, which is just the modern way of saying counter
revolutionary. People make the mistake of thinking individualism is the
opposite of collectivism, but that is false. The real enemy of Marxist
collectivism is the alternative identity group, rooted outside of
economics.

Putting that aside, the Marxist understanding of the 19th century
peasant is useful in this age for understanding the revolutionary
potential of normie. Like the peasant, the suburban white guy remains a
frustrating element in politics. He understands that he is under assault
from inhuman forces but refuses to band together with his fellows in
order to defend his interests. Instead, he spouts the morality of the
enemy, while hoping a hero arrives to save him from the bad guys.

This was most obvious with Donald Trump. The bad guys clearly understood
what Trump could represent, which is why they despised him. He could
radicalize normie, they thought, and get him thinking collectively, but
in a way that would oppose the interests of the narrow ruling elite. It
is why they insisted he was Hitler, despite the absurdity of the claim.
Like Hitler, they saw Trump as a radical alternative to the radical
assault on normal society.

What Trump represented to normie was the low-risk savior. He would be
their Napoleon, but he would not ask anything from them. They could
continue to grill, watch sports and consume the cultural products of the
regime, but Trump would make sure their small plot in the suburbs was
safe. From the perspective of normie, Trump was the low-risk defense
against the predation of the people they saw on their televisions
burning down cities and assaulting people.

Like the 19th century French peasants Marx observed, the modern suburban
peasant is atomized and isolated. He lives in a manufactured house. A
dozen or so houses make his neighborhood. A hundred or so houses makes
his development, always named after what was destroyed to build it. A
collection of developments makes for a socio-economic zone important
only to the people who sell them product. The suburban peasant is a
potato in sack.

Unlike the French peasant, the suburban peasant has been stripped of his
cultural, ethnic and moral identity. His church is the television and
his traditions are limited to whatever he can manage among the strangers
that make up his world. His spiritual fulfillment comes from playing
make believe on-line. The 19th century French peasant had the stability
of his environment. He stood where his ancestors stood. The modern
peasant stands wherever he is told.

The main difference between the 19th century peasant and the modern
suburban peasant is communications. The French peasant could go weeks or
months without speaking to neighbors. The suburban peasant cannot go
five minutes without information bombarding his senses. The same
information storm intended to keep the suburban peasant suspended within
a solution of information, often insulates him from his conditioning,
resulting in radicalization.

Marx was right about the French peasants. They were never much use for
the revolution, something the Bolsheviks would eventually learn as well.
For the modern dissident, there may be some portion of the suburban
peasantry that has radical potential, even if he is immune to direct
radicalization. The phenomenon of normie going from zero to eleven on
the radicalization scale after an incidental encounter with forbidden
material is well known.

This subset of the suburban peasantry, the alternative to normie,
is what the sociologist Donald Warren identified as the Middle American
Radical in the book *The Rad­ic­al Cen­ter: Middle Amer­ic­ans and the
Polit­ics of Ali­en­a­tion*. These are people who defy conventional
political framing, so they are often ignored. They are noticed when a
Pat Buchanan, a Ross Perot or a Donald Trump comes along. It is why all
efforts are made to funnel them back into the chute of conventional
politics.

In the end, the portion of the suburban peasantry called normie will
have little use for the cause, but there is a portion of the peasantry
that has potential. They see the futility of trying to exercise power
within the system, but they lack the structure to develop into an
alternative moral order that challenges the system. The guy with the
Gadsden flag on his house is a potato in a sack. The neighbor who reads
old books and no longer has a cable sub is a normie with revolutionary
potential.
