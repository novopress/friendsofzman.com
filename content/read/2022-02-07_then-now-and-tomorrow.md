**Note:** The <a
href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-total-failure-of-conservatism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up and related to the
today’s post. The ongoing debate about the future of conservatism is
interesting to me. It is good that such a thing is happening, but so far
it reveals that we are a long way from having a sensible debate. The
participants are still locked into an antiquated mode of thought.

Recently there has been a slow rolling debate among right-wing
intellectuals about the state of conservatism and what comes after
conservatism. The New Criterion held a <a
href="https://newcriterion.com/issues/2022/1/the-fallacies-of-the-common-good"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">symposium</a> on “common good
conservatism.” The James Wilson Institute has been debating originalism
and legal conservatism (<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> and <a
href="https://www.anchoringtruths.org/is-it-time-to-rethink-the-school-prayer-cases/when-matter-really-matters/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>). Josh Hammer from Yoram
Hazony’s group has also been <a
href="https://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/06/Hammer-Common-Good-Originalism.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">writing</a> about that topic. This debate
has also <a href="https://archive.is/3yRTF" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">spilled</a> into the foreign policy realm.

There are plenty of others chiming on the topic, but the starting point,
even if it is not acknowledged, is that conservatism is done. Whatever
comes next may carry the name, but it cannot be the same thing.
Interestingly, the old Buckley crowd is not a part of this debate, nor
are the neocons. They are too busy hanging onto their sinecures to think
much about what comes next. The paleocons have also been left out of the
debate, which is ironic given that they were right all along.

As is to be expected with people who view themselves as political
theorists, the back and forth is not always accessible. This is
especially true with regards to the debate around conservative
jurisprudence. It is in that debate, however, where we see the first
little green shoots of realism. In <a
href="https://www.anchoringtruths.org/is-it-time-to-rethink-the-school-prayer-cases/when-matter-really-matters/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this essay</a> the writer points out that
there will never be a great rollback of the school prayer decisions. The
main reason is no judge or lawyer would ever think such a thing is
proper.

The great transition from the original constitutional order to what we
have today did not happen in a vacuum. The people have changed, the
institutions have changed and the people running the institutions have
changed. The writer points out toward the end that the truth is the
original social order that is so popular with “constitutional
conservatives” no longer exists. America, from top to bottom, is a
different world from the one that produced the Constitution.

This is the problem with the current debate about the state of the
nation and especially the state of conservatism. The starting point is
always the belief that things can be rolled back or reset to a prior
order. It is a political revanchism where the plotters seek to
reestablish the old order, but this time the people in charge of that
order will not be so willing to change it. The proposed alternatives to
conservatism promise a return to the past, without regard for how we got
to the present.

If there is going to be a New Right in America then the starting point
must be a discussion about how we went from the 18th century liberal
political system to the present custodial state. In other words, it
means retracing our steps in order to find the point at which America
went off the course charted by the Founders and instead embarked on a
new path for the country. It is in the essay about school prayer that
the original sin begins to come into focus.

The writer points out that those school prayer decisions were the result
of the consolidation of judicial power under the incorporation doctrine,
which is the doctrine by which portions of the Bill of Rights have been
applied to the states. In the case of school prayer, the courts extended
the prohibition on the federal government regarding official religion to
the states. Later courts extended the definition of “official religion”
to include any reference to religion.

Clearly, the Founders never intended the establishment clause to apply
to the states, as it was never applied to the states until the 20th
century. The question is why did the court suddenly decide to apply
parts of the Bill of Right to the states and by what authority did they
do this? The answer is the 14th Amendment, passed as part of the
constitutional reforms following the Civil War. Of course, the reforms
were imposed by the victors as part of the spoils of war.

The Civil War did not happen in a vacuum. The roots of that conflict go
back to the English Civil War and the founding of the first colonies.
Note that the victors of the American Civil War were not the primary
hand drafting the Constitution. It was men of the South, with their
roots in the cavalier side of the English Civil war, who carried the day
on important debates forming the new Constitution. It was the losers of
those debates who carried the day seventy years later.

Another way of framing this is that the constitutional order so beloved
by originalists did not hold up very well to challenge. It collapsed in
the 19th century and since then the victors of the long running debate
dating back to the English Civil war have been trying to refashion a new
order and a new society. If conservatives are going to find a new path
forward, they must come to grips with the present. That means
reexamining the past in order to understand why their preferred model
failed.

This is why the current debate over conservatism is sterile. No one in
that debate is willing to reconsider the 19th century and the events
that transformed the country from that which the Founders designed to
what emerged in the 20th century. The events of the 19th century are now
holy writ. The second founding doctrine is just as entrenched with
conservatives as it is on the Left. In fact, both sides compete for who
best can achieve the perfect equality promised by the doctrine.

The starting place for a new conservatism is the acknowledgement that
the founding creation failed the test of reality. That naturally leads
to a debate as to why it failed, which is a debate about the 19th
century. That, in turns, means a rethinking of the 20th century in order
to gain a clear understanding of the present. Once a new historical
framework is in place, then a New Right can begin to chart a new course
for itself and the society in which it operates.
