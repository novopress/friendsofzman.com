One of the pitfalls of dissident politics is the temptation to succumb
to despair, focusing only on the negative. Excessive cynicism is an
escape, an indulgence, like libertarianism, where you get to pretend the
sideline is the high ground. Cynicism is a cost free way of both
participating in politics, but standing outside of it, as if you are
above it all. It has been a feature of modern conservatism as a way of
keeping the people from noticing that they are being scammed.

The truth is, politics at this level is not about elections or public
policy. It is about effective social change, by changing the frame of
reference. That’s a lot like steering a super tanker into port. A little
nudge here. A little there. In the moment, you see little progress, but
eventually, the tanker does move. That’s the point of dissident politics
in the current age. It is moving things a little here and a little there
in the effort to make our target audience aware of what’s happening to
them.

An example of one of those tiny little bits of evidence that the ship is
moving a little bit our way is <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/conservative-think-tank-american-compass-challenges-market-fundamentalism/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this post</a> from NRO, of all
places. It is an interview with Oren Cass, who is the director of a new
think tank in the Imperial Capital. The mission statement of
<a href="https://americancompass.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">American Compass</a> says it is “to restore an economic
consensus that emphasizes the importance of family, community, and
industry to the nation’s liberty and prosperity.” Put another way, they
claim to oppose what we call
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=19110"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marketism</a>.

Another Washington think tank is hardly an inspiration to our side, but
Oren Cass has gotten a lot of attention from influential people. <a
href="https://mobile.twitter.com/oren_cass/status/1230505649794166785"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This twitter thread</a>
spelled out the problem of worshiping economic data as an end in itself.
More important, he did so in the language technocrats can understand.
That is an important step, as it introduces dissident topics to people
lacking the language and mental constructs to understand much of what is
discussed on this side of the great divide.

A good example of this is <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/oren-cass-chart-of-doom/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the response</a> from another
NRO pod person to that Oren Cass twitter thread. Like so many in that
hive, he clearly does not understand the concept of trade-offs. He
certainly is clueless when it comes to concepts like social capital or
community capital. He’s stuck at the place where knowing that the big
number is more than the small number gets a gold star. Still, Cass is
able to speak to him in language he can grasp, which is important.

Now, this does not signal a revolution of thought inside the Imperial
Capital, but it does suggest some people inside are looking over the
divide to this side. More important, instead of just assuming the people
on this side of the great divide are evil or stupid, they are wondering
why so many people are heading this way. The first step to legitimacy is
often when the people in charge simply start taking their critics
seriously, rather than treating them as a pestilence to be eliminated.

To be clear, Oren Cass is not “one of us” and never will be. In fact, if
the inner party decides to round us up and ship us off to camps, he will
be right there with them, as he is *them* and not *us*. The ruling
class, along with their attendants, define themselves in opposition to
us. Who they are is explicitly not us. They are the occupiers, the
colonial pod people, ruling over the rest of us. Oren Cass and his
project are simply a flicker of doubt, a sign that all is not well
inside the walls.

A sober minded person would wonder why it has taken so long for anyone
inside the walls to notice the problems outside the walls. After all,
paleo-conservatives were predicting these sorts of problems forty years
ago. Pat Buchanan ran on these issues, as well as Ross Perot. Trump is
in the White House, in large part, because of the economic realities
just dawning on people inside the walls. Heck, Bernie Sanders exists
because of the things Cass identified in that thread.

It is the big tanker ship. A thing normal people cannot grasp is just
how different the world inside the walls is compared to regular America.
In the Imperial Capital, it is always a booming economy. Every day is
Fat Tuesday, because tomorrow is always fat Tuesday as well. It’s always
good times in the Washington for people who make their living in
politics. Imagine a college campus the size of a city, but instead of
students roaming about it is adult who work in politics.

This is why all past political reform efforts have failed. When the road
goes on forever and the party never ends, reform sounds like
ingratitude. From the Tea Party to the Bernie Bros, to the people
inside, these movement strike the revelers as irrational ingratitude by
people who don’t know how good they have it. But, the dissident right is
knocking at the door and some people are starting to listen. It is a
tiny example of how things are moving our way, ever so slowly, like that
tanker ship.
