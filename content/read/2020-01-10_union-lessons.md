This week is one of those times where the topic got away from me and the
result was not what I expected. My initial plan was to do four or five
segments on topics related to the early union movement. Maybe focus on
five people or five notable strikes and then pivot to how they relate to
our age. I like the five segment format as it pleases my sense of
balance, so I thought five ten minute bits on these topics would work.

Then I started putting together the first segment and things got away
from me. I quickly discovered that my own knowledge of the material was
inadequate. There were things I had either forgotten or never learned.
It was also clear that the topics I picked were bigger than what I can
cover in ten minutes. This week’s show is a good example of what happens
when you bite off more than you can chew.

Still, I like the topic and I’m going to come back to it. I also like
the fact that much of this is forbidden knowledge. The union movement
really is a great example of how the usual suspects hose the Left just
like they hose the Right. The modern union movement is thoroughly
incorporated into cosmopolitan globalism. When was the last time a
modern Progressive gave a speech in favor of labor?

The union movement is also a great topic for dissidents, because it
breaks that old conditioning most of us labor under, having come out of
conservatism. If you were a libertarian or any sort of conservative, you
were tuned to hate unions. That sense is still with us, but there is a
lot dissidents can learn from the union movement. We face many of the
same problems faced by labor a century ago.

The union movement is also a great way to begin thinking about the fact
that not all things should be subject to market forces. There are things
that are morally right because we believe them to be right on their
face. Whether or not they hold up in the marketplace is immaterial. The
treatment of our fellow citizens in the workplace is one of those things
that should never be left to the marketplace.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
