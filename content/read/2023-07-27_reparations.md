One of the things to look forward to in the next election will be Gavin
Newsome lecturing Tim Scott on the importance of reparations. This
assumes Tim Scott will be told to oppose the idea by the party. By next
fall reparations could be an ancient conservative principle so we could
see a contest between the two parties over who is promising the bigger
reparations check.

Either way, it is a safe bet that the subject will be mainstream by next
year. The effort to normalize the idea has been going on since the
George Floyd riots. California is working on a reparations report. The
idea is to release a big official looking study that will be the basis
for the following debate. This was popular back in the middle of the
last century whenever the progressives were plotting shenanigans.

Part of the plot will be a role for white people to play in the
manufactured drama that will play out on cable television and the
internet. Sean Hannity will take a week off for a new firmware update
and come back with a new set of lapel pins and a new vocabulary to
oppose the idea of reparations. It will be the old Washington Generals
routine that is the defining feature of the so-called conservative
movement.

Despite having a compliant opposition, it will not be easy for the
regime. While most blacks
[support](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2022/08/30/black-americans-views-on-reparations-for-slavery/)
the idea of robbing their white neighbors, a large percentage oppose the
idea, probably sensing it is a bridge too far. It is one thing to send
whitey off to a reeducation class every year. He is still being paid to
attend the DIE training. It is quite another to take food off his kid’s
plate.

The bigger problem is it will put the lie to the race issue. If you
demand money from whites to make blacks whole, then whites are going to
assume this either closes the books on race or it is just an act of
vengeance. Either way, it means unshackling white people from the guilt
of racism. White people either pay the debt, so no more demands, or they
see that the debt can never be paid, and it is time to move on.
