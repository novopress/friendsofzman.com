A little over a century ago, September 16, 1920, to be exact, a
horse-drawn wagon packed with 500-pounds of dynamite exploded outside
the headquarters of the J.P. Morgan & Co. bank on Wall Street. Thirty
people were killed instantly and another ten died from their wounds.
Over 100 other people were injured. The bombing was never solved, but
everyone assumed it was done by anarchists. Anarchist terrorism was
becoming common over the prior decade.

One consequence of the bombing was the federal government got serious
about the communists and anarchists in the country. They rounded them up
and deported them even though they could not pin the crime on them. The
elites also gained a new perspective on immigration after this bombing.
All of a sudden, letting anyone walk into the country was not so popular
with rich people. Not long after, immigration was sharply curtailed,
especially from Southern and Eastern Europe.

The incident is a good reminder of the reality of politics. Things that
vex the people will be ignored until they begin to threaten the rich
people. The bombing of the Los Angeles Times building in 1910 did not
register with the ruling class, because the people running the country
lived on the East Coast. The terrible impact of immigration on the
working classes was considered a feature by the wealthy. When the
reality of immigration landed on their doorstep, their attitudes quickly
changed.

Another example from the last century was medicine. For most of human
history the best medicine was money. Rich people avoided the general
fifth of society and they could avoid what passed for medicine. More
people were probably killed by doctors than disease as hospitals were
disgusting and until the 20th century, germ theory was unknown to
doctors. Avoiding hospitals and having a private doctor, along with
better food and sanitation was what kept rich people healthy.

The 20th century started to change that reality. The rich and poor
packed into cities which meant that disease loads were much higher. The
Spanish flu, for example, hit all classes of people, not just the poor.
It also struck young people, which made it even more frightening. Polio
was another scary disease. It had been around since forever, but
urbanization made it more common. Numerous urban  polio epidemics began
to appear starting in the 20th century.

All of a sudden, polio was causing panic and civil unrest, as epidemics
in major cities were reported by the mass media. Despite the fact most
infections were mild and only a tiny number of people suffered long term
effects, polio became a scary thing. One big reason for that is rich
people were getting sick with polio. Unlike most plagues, this was not
just a disease for the rabble. Polio was not sparing the wealthy. Just
like that, finding a solution to polio became a top priority.

Public health is another good example of how the ruling class acts only
when it serves their interests. Industrialization brought urbanization
which brought disease to the doorstep of the rich. Unlike in the feudal
order, the rich needed to be around the poor, who worked their factories
and maintained their cities. Being near filthy poor people living in
their own slop was dangerous, so the ruling classes set about improving
public health and sanitation in the urban areas.

Politically, the ruling class of any society operates as Jeremy Bentham
imagined all people would act if permitted. That is, the rich are
motivated by the desire for pleasure and the avoidance of pain.
Discharging their duties is avoided until not doing so promises more
pain than pleasure. They are only ever moved to act on behalf of the
greater good when they feel pain. This is especially true in liberal
societies, which select for sociopathy in the political class.

Counterintuitively, it means that the only real way for people in a
liberal democracy to get the attention of the political class is to
threaten their lives. We saw this last January when a very peaceful
group toured the Capitol. Within hours the city was turned into an armed
camp. The same people who claim drug crimes are impossible to police and
make excuses for black violence were suddenly able to find every last
protestor and lock down the city for months.

This is something to keep in mind when wondering when the lunacy of the
Covid panic will come to an end. Right now, it is great fun for rich
people who are not required to play along with the loons. The
politicians have to participate in Covid theater, but in private they
think it is just a big goof. They take pleasure in mocking the crazies
and their ornamental face gear. They think it is hilarious that the
masses just go along with the ridiculous measures that serve no purpose
beyond humiliation.

This nonsense ends when the ruling class decides it ends and that
happens when the cost to them gets serious. Economic trouble is one
obvious way the cost quickly becomes intolerable. That may be what lies
ahead in 2022, as another round of Covidian theater craters a struggling
economy. Someone taking a shot at one of these provincial politicians is
another possible wakeup call. Organized resistance is unlikely, but a
localized “event” is certainly possible.

Regardless, reason and reality are not going to end this lunacy. For the
rich it is just an amusing game of human chess. For their servants in
political office, it is a way to pretend their lives have meaning. Of
course, there are plenty of stupid people willing to degrade themselves
in order to feel like they are part of something. What puts the brakes
on this dynamic is when the war comes home to the rich people. Until
they start to feel the pain, Covid mania is a feature of life in the
West.

It is an interesting lesson in the reality of democracy. Since
democratic government selects for sociopathy, the result is a government
that is far less responsive than allegedly autocratic systems. The
dictator or king can be motivated by a sense of duty to his office or
his legacy. Elected officials are motivated purely by pleasure and pain
and they are extremely low in empathy. It turns out that democracy works
only when the people are prepared to use violence.

This may be why democratic systems precede autocratic ones. It is not
that mob rule becomes unreasonable, but that violent mob action becomes
the only reasonable response to the indifference of democratic rule. The
mob hangs their elected officials and the rich are suddenly moved to act
by installing a dictator who will address the concerns of the masses. In
other words, democracy is not mob rule but rule by sociopath, which is
remedied by the strong hand of leadership.
