<a
href="https://www.eagnews.org/2014/08/1000-member-secretive-progressive-journalist-group-uncovered/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here we go again</a>. The last
time [they got caught coordinating their “news
reporting”](http://gawker.com/here-is-the-archive-of-the-famous-liberal-media-journol-530195415)
it was very entertaining. Tucker Carlson really enjoyed tormenting them
with their own e-mails. While there’s nothing wrong with members of the
same club buzzing together on-line, these are the folks constantly
tisk-tisking about ethics in journalism and all that nonsense. It looks
like some of them did not learn their lesson.

*A prominent CNN commentator, the top two political reporters for The
Huffington Post, a Reuters reporter, the editor of The Nation magazine,
a producer for Al Jazeera America television, a U.S. News & World Report
columnist, and approximately two dozen Huffington Post contributors are
among the more than 1,000 members of Gamechanger Salon.*

*Founded by leftwing activist Billy Wimsatt, the group is a secretive
digital gathering of writers, opinion leaders, activists and political
hands who share information, ideas and strategy via a closed Google
group.*

*The group’s existence was discovered by Media Trackers through an open
records request filed with a University of Wisconsin professor who
happened to be a member of the network.*

There’s something deeply weird about people in a competitive racket like
the media going in for something like this. The reason these liberal
personalities blend together on the screen is all of them say the same
things. Talk radio guys love doing montages of them using the exact same
phrasing. It’s good radio. If your career depends on being a draw on TV
or on-line, blending in with the blob seems odd.

But, I’m not a member of a cult.

Related is a [very weird post on
Wonkette](http://wonkette.com/556337/wingnuts-expose-leftist-google-group-before-it-can-conquer-america).

*Pity the poor wingnuts. They worked so hard to bust ACORN into a
million pieces and salt the earth so no part of it would ever grow back.
Little did they know that the Progressive Menace was just using ACORN as
a distraction while it rebuilt the most fearsome of all anti-American
organizations dedicated to spreading leftist propaganda like the Ebola
virus: JournoList, which has been reconstituted as a closed Google Group
called Gamechanger Salon. And the conservative website Mediatrackers.org
is ON IT.*

*First, a disclaimer: Despite our impeccable leftist credentials, yr
Wonkette is not now, nor has it ever been, a member of the Communist
Party secretive anti-American group Gamechanger Salon. Nor would we join
a group with such a stupid name. Seriously, you guys couldn’t come up
with something better? The wingnuts are going to find it scary no matter
what, so go all out. Call it Mao’s House of Propaganda or All Hail Pol
Pot or HITLER! (The all caps with exclamation point is so they know
you’re serious.)*

Another coo-coo for cocoa-puffs site I used to like trolling was
<a href="http://firedoglake.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">FireDongLake</a>. All of these lefty sites popped up in
the middle of the Bush years and most were founded by women or
[homosexuals](http://www.dailykos.com/). In other words, people with
hormonal imbalances seem to be drawn to this form paranoid stuff.
