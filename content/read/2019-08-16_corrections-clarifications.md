I’ve been burning the candle at both ends for a while now and I think it
is starting to catch up with me. When I started to think about topics
for the podcast this week, I was coming up blank. I kept thinking about
various ideas I’ve had for posts, based on comments I’ve seen over the
last few months. Since I was struggling to come up with content for the
show this week, I decided to take up those blog post ideas and use those
for the podcast, rather than save them for future writing projects.

One of the things that happens when you have an audience growth is new
people come along, who are unfamiliar with your past positions.
Something that happens when you have around for a while is you tend to
say everything you have to say about a subject and then move onto other
things. Put the two together and the new people often assume you have
not tackled their favorite subject. That’s part of the motivation for
the show this week. Going back and addressing some old topics.

As I was getting into it, I started thinking about other topics that I
could include, but I was going long for some reason, so they were will
have to wait. One that I will take up in a blog post is the issue of
drug taking and drug policy. Like the issue of community activism, this
is one where you see the defeated nature of whites. The nation’s drug
policies and the debate over them does more to foster white guilt than
all of the lectures from emotionally disturbed feminists on twitter.

Just a quick note on upcoming events. I will be attending the Scandza
Forum in Copenhagen this October. If you are in the area or want to be
in the area, details for attending are <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. I’ll be at the
<a href="http://hlmenckenclub.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Mencken Club</a> conference this November. For those
looking to get an idea what these conferences are like, Mencken is a
good first event as it is well done and at a convenient location. BWI is
a cheap airport to fly to and the event is at hotel that is reasonably
priced. It is a good time.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
