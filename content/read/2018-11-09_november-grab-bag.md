Hello darkness my old friend. We are in the moist glorious time of the
year, when the clocks are restored to normalcy. There’s nothing more
invigorating than going to work in the dark and coming home in the dark.
Some people hate this time of year, but autumn is by far my favorite
season, followed by winter. I like the shorter days particularly. This
is something that has always been true for me, even as a kid. It’s
probably a biology thing, as I learned over the summer. The Danes are
also big fans of the *hygge* time of year.

At the Mencken Conference, a few people asked if I was ever going to do
interviews on the podcast. I’ve always said no, but maybe I should
reconsider. It keeps coming up for a reason, so maybe it is something I
could do well. I’ve always just assumed I’d not be good at it, but I
could be wrong about that. My assumption is you need to have a strong
interest in the person in order to interview them, but maybe that’s
wrong. It could be the other way around, where a good interview requires
a distance between the interviewer and guest.

I’ll think about it some more, but I’m also pleased with how things are
now. It took a while to get it right, but I’m generally satisfied with
the results. I’m also seeing steady growth in listenership now. Part of
it is I’ve made the show available on a wide range of systems, like
Spotify, which is big with younger people. It turns out that iHeart is
popular with people who listen in cars. Who knew? There’s a big European
podcast network that is like the iTunes of Europe. Still, I think the
simple format and style works best for me too.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
