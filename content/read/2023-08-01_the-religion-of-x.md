Imagine if Elon Musk decides that he is a messenger from “Old Ones” sent
to earth to start a new religion based around technology. The “Old Ones”
are the spirits of Martians who have transcended this plane of
existence. They have gifted Musk with certain abilities that have
allowed him to become the world’s richest man, thus freeing him from all
social constraints but also leaving him with the understanding of how
normal people relate to the world and one another.

Musk’s new religion, the Church of All Worlds, combines the hedonistic
elements of libertarianism with incomprehensible elements from Western
epistemology to give the new religion a mysterious quality. Initiates
learn the insider language of the religion and how to use the new
phrases to signal their status in the religion. Most important, they
learn that they are an elect chosen to ruthlessly rule over the rest of
mankind and punish the weak for their weakness.

You see, in Musk’s new religion, he is the holiest of holy because he is
the richest and most powerful man on the planet. Everyone’s holiness
quotient is measured against the standard of Musk. Therefore, weakness
and vulnerability are considered the worst sins and punished by the
Church of All Worlds. This is not a religion promising salvation for the
oppressed, but a religion promising the believers salvation *from* the
oppressed by licensing violence against the weak.

For those sure that the word “religion” means only what they believe,
this will not sound like a real religion. After all, the definition of
religion is exactly what they believe, so by definition anything calling
itself a religion that does not exactly match their beliefs is a false
religion. Others might point out that Musk’s new religion lacks the
essential elements of a religion like a liturgy or a holly book. Others
will argue that the “Old Ones” business is just warmed over paganism.

Most people, however, will be troubled by the fact that his new religion
seems to justify kicking people while they are down. This religion of
the elect, or “master race” as Musk prefers to call his followers, is
providing a justification for the strong to attack the weak, which is
the opposite of what people think of with regards to religion. Thousands
of years of conditioning have taught us that religion promises the weak
salvation from the torments of this world, especially from the predation
of the strong.

Sensing that his new religion is not working, he changes the name of the
new religion from the Church of All Worlds to X. Atop his megachurch he
has installed a giant neon X that you can see from space. He changes the
definition of weak to include those who choose not to join the new
religion. Their doubt is their weakness. The weak can enjoy earthly
power if they give up their old ideas and join X. Those who refuse
remain fair game, but the door is always open to them.

That sounds a bit better, even if the new name strikes everyone as
stupid. His new religion still celebrates the abuse of the weak and
vulnerable, but it gives them a path out of their condition. All they
have to do is stop fighting the tides of history and they can enjoy the
benefits of being on the winning team. Musk and his lieutenants will
still be at the top and the material life for the convert will not
change that much, but they will avoid having mobs of black-clad street
activists attacking them.

In this way, Musk’s new religion incorporates that old Christian concept
of salvation but retains the Nietzschean notion that the strong must
dominate the weak. The believers still get to demonstrate their
superiority by attacking the weak, but they get to view it as salvation
from the wicked. The weak now have a clear path out of their condition,
so if they remain in their condition, they must secretly reject the new
religion. Their condition is proof of their rejection of and attack on
the elect.

This new configuration also opens up whole new areas of scholarship for
otherwise useless people to explain why the weak persist in their
weakness. Weakness studies leads to weakness experts, who make a living
explaining to the faithful why the weak are actually a threat to the
strong. In fact, the weak are proof of a conspiracy against the strong,
thus making the weak a public display of violence against the strong. It
is a matter of self-defense for the strong to attack the weak!

Probably the most important innovation in the religion of X is that it
turns success within the new moral order into proof of strength and
moral fitness. Those at the top are free to think poorly of those below
them, who are thankful for the reinforcement, as it justifies their own
shabby treatment of those below them. In this way, everyone in the
religion has a sense of moral superiority over someone, but also a
strong motivation to maintain the rules of the new moral order.

The trouble with the religion of X is that it could run out of weak
people, so it has to create a mechanism to make sure the supply of weak
people is steady. This is where the weakness studies people really show
their stuff. They police the lower ranks of the religion for
troublemakers, declaring them weak while focusing the attention of the
lower ranks on them. This maintains the supply of weaklings and serves
as a reminder to the faithful that the price of strength is eternal
vigilance.

Eventually, a schism develops between the wing of the faith that is in
it only for the debauchery and those who are in it to destroy the world.
The latter camp is actually stronger than the former camp, but they
continue to insist they are the weaker party, which triggers a mob from
the former camp to attack them. Musk is killed and the church collapses,
leading to a civil war. This ends when a new powerful group, led by a
man claiming to be a descendent of Musk restores order.
