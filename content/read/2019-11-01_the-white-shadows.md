I’ve gotten some negative feedback of late about the fact I sound too
scripted and spend too much time reading news stories. I think both are
related, as I don’t use a script when I do this. I just make some notes
and, of course, read the passages of news items I’m doing. Of course, if
I’m reading too much copy then I will sound scripted, so that would be
why I may sound too scripted. It is one of those things I did not notice
until someone pointed it out to me. I have been reading a lot more than
commenting.

It is always best to respond to criticism by swinging wildly in the
opposite direction, so that is what I’m doing this week. There will be
no reading aloud in the show. Not only that, I did not even make notes
to remind me of the things I wanted to say in each segment. It’s all off
the top of the head in one take. The only prep is I came up with five
topics for the show. Otherwise, it is just me talking about the topics
as it comes to me for an hour. Even the closing has more me than usual.

Now, I like to mix things up, which is probably not a good thing with
this type of content, as people prefer regularity. Someone finds the
show, they like it and expect more of the same each week. Variety is the
spice of life, not the staple of life. That said, I do what I enjoy and
I like variety, which means trying new things and testing out ideas that
I think could be fun. This week is a show on dissident organizing, which
is pretty far outside my normal content. Just call me Zee Alinsky now.

The reason for this is the topic keeps getting raised by people I meet
at various dissident events, like the one I was at last week. It comes
up in my e-mail every time I write about an event. There are a lot of
people who would like to connect with local people of their kidney to
form a social group. There is a great unmet demand for community among
our people, but organic, grassroots organizing from the Right is not
something you can just buy a book and learn to do.

This week’s show is not intended to be the final word on organizing, but
rather a starting point on the topic. The one thing we have going for us
is a lot of creative, bright people willing to tackle tough questions.
The more these topics are discussed by people with an audience, the more
our smart people will think about them. Eventually, the answers bubble
to the surface. That and it spreads the word that there are lots of
people all over who want to belong to a dissident group in their area.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
