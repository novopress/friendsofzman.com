**Note:** This being the time of year when people feel generous, you may
be thinking about sending a few bucks to a worthy cause. If you are an
HBD fan or a supporter of academic integrity, you should consider
kicking in a few bucks to the Bryan Pesta fundraiser that you can learn

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common theme on this side of the great divide is the growing
perception gap between the people in the regime that rules over the
Global American Empire and the people who are trapped inside that
empire. The relationship between the ruled and their rulers is becoming
two black boxes. The people see their rulers perform, but why they are
doing what they are doing makes little sense. The rulers look over the
walls and see nothing but monsters lying in wait for them.

This growing disconnect was on display in the Imperial Capital, when the
dictator of Ukraine arrived to a hero’s welcome. Dictator is not a word
the regime members use, even though it is the correct title. Zelensky
rules with an iron fist, throwing critics into dungeons and terrorizing
the people into submission. The excuse is the war, but democratic
countries still hold elections in times of crisis. Tyrants suspend the
rule of law when it suits their interests.

For most Americans, Ukraine is a weird place far away that has no
bearing on their lives, because it should have no bearing on their
lives. Most Americans feel for the common people whose lives are ruined
by the war. Most American would prefer it if their government did
something to end the conflict. In fact, it is safe to say that Americans
wish their government were the global peacemaker. That would be
something that could genuinely unite a very divided country.

Otherwise, the typical American has no interest in this war. If provided
the facts, they would be appalled at the actions of their government.
The Ukrainians took delivery of High Mobility Artillery Rocket System
(HIMARS) from American and immediately used them to target residential
areas of the Donbas. War is always an ugly business and brother wars are
the worst in this regard. Even so, the typical American would want
nothing to do with the deliberate targeting of civilians.

The fact is, the typical American, regardless of political affiliation,
would wholeheartedly agree with John Quincy Adams when he said “Wherever
the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled,
there will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she goes
not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to
the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator
only of her own.”

Anyone living in the world of normal Americans knows this. Despite this,
the regime put on a prime time show in which the dictator of Ukraine,
dressed like an extra from bad war movie, gave a weird speech to
Congress. In that speech he demanded more money from the average
American and gave the strong impression that he thinks the average
American is not pulling his weight in terms of sacrificing for a country
he cannot locate on a map.

What made the spectacle grotesque was the fawning over this belligerent
midget by the regime leaders. It was a vulgar display of the disconnect
that now exists between the regime and the people. Mitch McConnell came
out and said that his number one priority, to the exclusion of all else,
is shoveling untold billions into the rat hole that is the war in
Ukraine. Imagine being a guy struggling to pay his rent in Kentucky
having to listen to that lecture.

What makes the whole thing revolting to the average person is that
everyone knows much of the money is being stolen. Even though the FBI
has been working long hours to suppress the facts of the Hunter Biden
laptop, the typical American knows the Biden family is as crooked as a
ram’s horn. They know all of these people are corrupt, yet they have to
watch these people celebrate their alleged moral purity over shoveling
more cash into the Ukraine money laundering machine.

In other words, the growing gap between the regime and the people is not
simply a gap in understanding or a gap in priorities. It is a moral gap.
Every day the people inside the regime imagine themselves on higher
moral ground than the day before, while the people looking on see their
leaders sinking into a swamp of moral depravity. It is not just that
there is a gap, but that the gap is rapidly widening. Each new outrage
by the freaks of the regime lowers their standing with the people.

Few commentators have noticed the parallel between Washington’s support
for Ukraine and the support for Vietnam sixty years ago. It is a good
comparison because the cause is the same. The people running Vietnam
policy were every bit as deluded about their intelligence as the people
running Ukraine policy. In fact, Victoria Nuland and the rest of the
Kagan cult are setting new standards for Dunning-Kruger. Mx. Nuland is
an unfathomably stupid woman.

The important parallel is deeper than just shared stupidity. Vietnam
undermined the trust people had in their rulers to the point where
serious people became concerned that the country was headed for a
breakup. That was in a relatively homogenous and prosperous country.
Today’s America is an irreconcilable collection of fractious and
deracinated people with no reason to hang together other than
convenience and fear of an increasingly hostile ruling class.

If the economic chickens come home to roost in 2023 as the economic
experts tell us, this erosion of trust and respect for the regime will
quickly become a crisis. People may look back at this shameful orgy of
self-satisfaction, at the expense of the people, as a tipping point in
the relationship between the regime and the people. Watching that show,
it would take a heart of stone not to hate these people. It was the
point when even the most faithful civic nationalist began to hate.
