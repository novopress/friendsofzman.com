If you have ever been to a concert where the acts are from the golden
age of rock music, you probably noticed that they seem naturally good.
They know their material and they know their audience. There is a high
production quality to the show and the performers professionally do
their best material. The reason for this is they have done it for so
long, they know what works and what does not work. Old carnies seem so
good because they have been at it for so long.

Successful comics will often talk about how they got some advice from an
old comic that changed their approach and launched their career. The old
comic, after years of trial and error, figured out the formula and
passed it onto the young guy, who then avoided the trial-and-error part
to produce a popular act. Experience is the best teacher, especially in
the circus. It is why long-running television shows seem so much better
in terms of production quality at the end than in the beginning.

You see this with Jordan Peterson. Here is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYGNTFY4ZIQ" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">recent video</a> of Peterson interviewing an
up-and-coming political carny named James Lindsay. The difference
between the two is striking because at this point, Peterson is an old
hand. He has been doing his act for so long he no longer knows where the
act ends, and he begins. Lindsay, on the other hand, is on his third act
now, this one is something called “woke right”, so he is still working
out the kinks in his performance.

Of course, it is possible that the reason Lindsay comes off as a crazy
person is that he is suffering from some sort of mental illness. There
are signs that he may be struggling to keep it together. The darting
eyes and the facial tics suggest he is not entirely sure if what is
coming out of his mouth is what he hears in his head. It does not help
that it seems like his chin is retreating into his skull. He looks like
a guy who spends far too much time with his model trains.

It is an interesting interview from the perspective of carny life.
Usually, we get the stories of old carnies passing wisdom onto young
carnies from the perspective of the old carny reflecting on his early
career. In this video we get to be at the table as the old carny talks
to the young carny, trying to help him out in his career. It is
important to note that carnies are carnies all the time. It is a
lifestyle choice. That means that even when they are talking shop, they
are performing.

In the case of Peterson, his act is now familiar, and he has done it for
so long that it feels completely natural. It is like how Kevin Costner
no longer seems like a terrible actor because he has been doing the same
act for decades. His robotic line reading is now part of the character
we know as Kevin Costner. You see this with musicians like Bruce
Springsteen, who are terrible singers, but their terribleness over a
long period of time is now part of their appeal.

Now, if you look at Peterson when he was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">still working out the kinks</a> in his act, you see the
beginnings of the current act. There are the carefully considered facial
expressions, the long contemplative pauses, and the endless word salad
that his target audience naturally confuses with profundity. Of course,
Peterson looks like he is still high from his weekend trip to Miami
because he was probably taking drugs. This video was before he went to
that mysterious Russian “detox” facility.

The comments in that old Peterson video are interesting. One commenter
wrote, “I love how he´s always picking the water cup up but then becomes
engaged in what he´s saying and ends up putting it down without having
had a drink.” Peterson still does this bit when he has the prop
available. Good carnies study their audience and that is what he is
trying to tell Lindsay in that interview. The successful carny sticks
with what works and drops the stuff that bombs.

James Lindsay is not Jordan Peterson and never will be. That is another
thing about the successful carny. His act makes him a popular
personality and it is his personality that becomes the main draw for the
audience, not the act. The audience will tire of the bit eventually, but
they will stick with a favored personality. Lindsay is simply too weird
to have that sort of appeal. He is the guy who stands too close to you
in the checkout line, not a guy you watch from the comfort of you
livingroom.

In that interview, you see something else about carny life. Peterson is
happy to bring on Lindsay because he knows Lindsay is a one hit wonder.
Acts like his are props for the guys who have broken through and become
established performers. Soon, people get bored of the “woke right’
nonsense. For now, old hands like Peterson can use the popularity of a
guy like this in his own act. One of the cold hard truths about carny
life is that there is no honor among carnies.

Another of those truths is that even the top acts in the circus run
their course. Peterson is showing all the signs of a fading star. The
culture is changing, so the old acts from the censorship era are not as
edgy now. Peterson is an old crooner just as bands are growing their
hair long and singing about drugs. The act is fine and still has its
appeal, but it is no longer what the cool kids want. Another thing about
carny life is that eventually, the dogs bark and the circus moves on.
