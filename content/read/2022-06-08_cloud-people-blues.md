a response, of sorts, to this

save us.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The late Joe Sobran famously said, “In their mating and migratory
habits, liberals are indistinguishable from members of the Ku Klux
Klan.” Less famous writers have often pointed out that the American Left
talks like MLK but lives like the KKK. Without exception, the white
people staking out fashionable positions on race do so from as far away
from black people as possible. Antifascists love Portland Oregon because
it is one of the least diverse cities in the county.

This was always true. Sobran made his observation about the American
Left forty years ago when the country was still 85% white. Thirty
million South American tourists later and the Left may be even more
sensitive this reality. On the one hand, they have become violent in
their racial politics, but also extremely sensitive to the reality of
race in the daily lives. Forty years ago, white race hustlers actually
went to the ghetto once in a while, but now they stay as far away as
possible.

This heightened contradiction could prove to be a fatal flaw for the
sorts of race politics the political class has enjoyed for decades. The
California elections show that left-wing white people have zero
tolerance for their preferred race policies. San Francisco voters
removed far-left District Attorney Chesa Boudin from office. The reason
was he let black criminals loose on the city in the name of racial
vengeance. It turns out that left-wing voters do not want black guys
robbing their local Walgreens.

In many respects, the American Left is the reactionary wing of the old
ruling majority of the country that is slowly fading away. Left-wing
strongholds tend to be wealthy, orderly places where the managerial
class enjoy a white nationalist lifestyle. The exceptions are the carve
out areas for minority candidates. They will vote overwhelming for
Democrats, often resulting in comic figures like Maxine Waters. The
Mexican version of this tends to be more sober minded, but still firmly
Democratic.

The white reactionary enclaves, like many of the areas in San Francisco,
are mostly about maintaining the old 1950’s lifestyle. The people there
want safe streets, good schools, fashionable living and they are willing
to pay for it. In addition to the high cost of living comes a tolerance
for boutique ideas. The social contract on the Left is they support
novel political ideas, as long as they get to live like the people in
the hit television show *Madman*, set in the 1950’s.

This is not just an issue for the Left. Most conservative politicians
and leaders live in fashionably liberal areas like Washington and
Northern Virginia. The deal Conservative Inc. struck long ago was that
the middle-class white suburbs get left alone, in exchange for going
along with the egalitarian fantasies about race. They get to scold their
voters about race while making sure to never make the mistake of getting
off on the Martin Luther King Boulevard exit to get gas.

The problem with this old arrangement is the digital world is a smaller
place, so it is really hard to hide from reality. In the 1960’s, these
crackpot ideas about crime took a decade to sink their teeth into the
culture. America in 1968 was still fairly good for most people but by
1978 the cost of fashionable politics was too high. In this age, the
cost started hitting home hours after someone explained the new bail
reform policy in the Facebook group for the smash and grab community.

There is another twist to this. The effort to racialize the Hispanic
vote is not going the way the politicians expected. It turns out that
Mexicans are not willing to think of themselves as black or share
politics with blacks. The whole “people of color” thing is not working
with Hispanics, especially Mexicans. Unlike blacks, this group wants
tangible results, especially regarding working class issues. They vote
like the old white working class, that the modern Left still enjoys
mocking.

It is not all puppies and sunshine for Conservative Inc. with regards to
the changing nature of the Hispanic vote. The happy talk about them
being “natural conservatives” was right but using the old definition of
conservative. That is, someone who wants to live in an orderly white
neighborhood where a man can raise a family. They are not interested in
waging pointless wars of choice, handing out favors to corporate donors
and treating the middle-class like a dumping ground.

It is turning out that the old consensus where the managerial class gets
to live like it is the 1950’s and the rest of us have to embrace the
post-racial future is not going to hold up for much longer. When the
soulless bugmen of San Francisco are jumping off the racial vengeance
ship, the consensus is untenable. Politics, regardless of the system,
must be about fixing potholes and controlling the criminal element. A
system that cannot do the basics is not going to last very long.

None of this should be taken to mean the end is near. Both parties are
relics of a bygone era run by fossils with no connection to reality.
Most white people have no representation in politics. Hispanics appear
to be on the same path. These groups will vote for whoever seems to
represent their interests, but it will not matter as both parties are
controlled by the usual suspects. In the short run it means more
Marjorie Taylor Green type characters and a rise in general frustration.
