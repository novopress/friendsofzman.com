[In one of his recent communications with the
resistance](http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/RadioDerb/2017-01-20.html),
John Derbyshire mentioned this <a
href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/19/blue-state-blues-obama-god-failed/"
target="_blank">Joel Pollak column</a> about the demise of the Obama
cult. Pollak does not come right out and say it, but Obama was
essentially a totem for the Left. His election was not about him or his
polices, but instead it was about returning the Ark to the Temple, so to
speak. The long war with the bad whites over racial justice was finally
won and the blessings of the void where God used to exist would now
descend upon the righteous.

As Derbyshire points out, Pollak is not the first guy to notice this as
readers of this site certainly know. The only way to properly understand
the American Left is to look at it as a civic religion. Because the
American Left adopted European anti-Christianity in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, it is easy to think they are anti-religious. That’s a mistake
the Right has made for half a century. The New Religion, what
Progressivism is today, evolved out of the Social Gospel Movement, so it
carries with it many of the same habits.

The most obvious of those habits is the obsession with public morality.
Public Protestantism starts from the assumption that society is judged
as a whole. The righteous, like the virtuous in revolutionary France,
have a moral duty to raise up the fallen into the righteous life. This
is what gives them license to nose around in your business and order you
around.  It’s not about fitting the economic pieces together as with
European socialists. The American Left is consumed with building the
City upon a hill.

Derbyshire makes the point that when a prophecy fails, it is does not
mean the end of the religion.

Again, readers of this site know where this is going. The thing that
holds together these sorts of movements is an internal psychology that
allows them to internalize disconfirmation. There is a famous study in
psychology by three guys
named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"
target="_blank">Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter</a>.
They studied a UFO cult based in Chicago that claimed space aliens were
due to arrive on a certain date. When that failed to happen, the cult
did not dissolve. It transformed into something else.

That’s an important lesson to keep in mind when watching the antics of
the Left of late. Their lunacy is not directed at the rest of us. They
don’t care what you or anyone else thinks about what’s happening. Their
public acts are about signalling to the rest of the believers. By
holding protests and making fools of themselves in a public way, they
are providing support for one another as they work through the
disconfirmation. Like herd animals, they are huddling together in the
face if danger. It is pure instinct.

If they were left to sit alone at home, they would have no one around to
help them through their doubts. These are people whose entire sense of
self is dependent on the identity of the group, so getting out and
“making their voices heard” lets them focus on something other than the
disconfirmation. Trump as Hitler provides a short term bridge between
the failed prophesy and whatever comes next for the New Religion. They
can tell themselves that their faith was not wrong, it was just
subverted by mysterious forces, or Hitler.

In the past, Progressive Awakenings were followed by period of
hibernation as new missions and causes were conjured by the next
generation of believers. The trouble for them this time is there is no
obvious replacement for identity politics and social justice. When
you’re reduced to championing the rights of mentally ill men in
sundresses, you have run out of victims. The nation’s changing
demographics also means that identity politics will play against this
sort of utopianism.

In the mean time, the rage of the true believers will result in more
public displays of incoherent misery. The reason they have no point is
they cannot face the cause of their pain. It has nothing to with Trump
or his policies. It is an unspeakable rage at having failed to reach the
promised land. The rage is a distraction and a source of comfort to the
believers as the Cult of Modern Liberalism comes to terms with the great
disconfirmation of the last decade. Let’s hope they to make their way
through it.
