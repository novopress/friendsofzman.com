week I had some trouble with my studio setup. By “studio” I mean my
bedroom. The sound quality was all over the map for some reason. I did
the best I could to clean it up using the software available to me. That
means my beautiful voice will sound a bit less beautiful than normal. It
was actually a bit distracting, which probably caused more trouble for
me than the actual technical issues. Such is life in the podcast biz.

Anyway, this week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard
format. The feedback thus far suggests the four 10-minute segments
followed by some short segments is the sweet spot. This week I have a
bonus track on Gab, where I address one of your comments on civic
nationalism. If you are not on Gab, you should be. Despite their flaws,
they are the good guys fighting to keep the lamps from going out in the
West.

For this week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the four longer
segments from the show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android phone
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones.
