If you have lived in one of the Left’s strongholds for any amount of
time, you learn how to navigate around your local moonbats so as to
avoid the harangue about whatever it is they are into at the moment. A
decade ago when they started vibrating in ecstasy over homo marriage,
the safe course was to say, “Let ’em be as miserable as the rest of us!”
Then you could walk away without having to listen to the sermon.

Libertarians have built an entire philosophy around avoiding contact
with the enemy. Gay marriage? They are against marriage licenses!
Immigration? They are against borders! Whatever the issue, they always
have some third implausible option they champion so everyone can ignore
them. In the culture wars that have roiled the nation over the last
fifty years, libertarians have been hiding under their beds.

Anyway, that may be a fine way to avoid conflict, but it makes public
discourse impossible. A good example of it is in
<a href="http://nypost.com/2015/10/05/earth-to-matt-damon-its-2015/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this screed</a> about Matt Damon in
America’s newspaper of record.

*Matt Damon is an insufferable jerk. You know it. I know it. Rupert
Everett most certainly does.*

*The Hollywood liberal (read: smug hypocrite) has interrupted the
outer-space high surrounding Friday’s release of his Oscar-bait star
turn, “The Martian,” to conduct a parallel “I’m Not a Homophobe” tour.
But it’s only driving him deeper into the quicksand with LGBTQ types and
those, like me, **who couldn’t care less whom a performer loves.** It’s
2015, Matt. Get over yourself!*

*He should grovel. GLAAD should dedicate a lecture series to him.*

*He should shut the hell up.*

I’m betting that Andrea Peyser would care a lot if a celeb was found to
be “loving” a sheep or a little boy. This affected indifference when it
comes to homosexuals is exactly that, artificial. To have an opinion
about homosexuals, other than the enthusiastic embrace, means you are
evil, maybe even Hitler. If you can’t stomach being Hitler or you cannot
embrace sodomy, then you choose the third option, which is to stand on
the sidelines and pretend you do so on principle.

Now, Matt Damon is a lunk head and he says batty things. That just makes
him a typical Hollywood performer. He’s in a business dominated by gay
men so he is courting trouble by speaking publicly about the queers. He
could stand up and say all Christians are Nazi pedophiles and his peers
would applaud. Appear less than enthusiastic about buggery and you get
to bunk with Mel Gibson. Shutting up is probably the best path for him
to take.

If you want to live in some version of Iran, ceding the floor to the
fanatics is a good way to do it. That is where we are headed. As the
space for honest disagreement grows smaller, the number of people
willing to risk getting the Hitler treatment grows smaller. Before long
the only people left on stage are the guys with the clubs. Andrea
Peyser’s admonition, “He should just shut up” becomes a way a life.
