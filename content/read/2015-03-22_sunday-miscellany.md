To keep this blog interesting, I clip stories from Twitter and other
places and save them for later use. Often, there’s simply not much that
needs to be said about them so I thought I’d clear out the attic today
and combine a bunch of them into a single post. There’s no theme here,
other than I happen to notice them for some reason.

<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">I saw this</a> posted on
<a href="http://maggiesfarm.anotherdotcom.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Maggie’s Farm</a> yesterday. I know a few people in the
drug and alcohol treatment rackets. To a man, they say that their
methods are entirely useless on people lacking the will or capacity to
stop using. They also report that almost all addicts are more than a bit
nuts and their drug and alcohol abuse is a symptom of that.

The question, of course, is whether these programs are anything more
than a clearing house for addicts. Eventually, their drinking or drug
taking gets them into trouble and they head off to treatment. Those with
the will and ability to get sober do so and those lacking it fall down
further. In other words, the treatment is irrelevant. It is the idea of
it that works as a sorting mechanism…

<a href="https://www.heartland.org/patrick-moore" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">The founder of Green Peace is a heretic</a>. I was told
by a Jewish friend that Jewish men naturally become more religious as
they get older. He jokingly refers to Temple as God’s waiting room. It
seems to me that Gentile men go the other way and become less religious
in old age. Not only that, they become less tolerant of social codes and
taboos.

British men seem to be famous for this last part. Something snaps and
their words come raw and unvarnished. John Derbyshire is a good example.
James Watson is another. Patrick Moore is Canadian, but either English
or Irish ethnicity. I suspect that’s what is happening here. He has hit
that stage where he is no longer willing to pretend and out comes the
unvarnished truth…

I find the comments are often better than the content of news stories.
Steve Sailer’s blog is mostly a comment magnate. Sailer seems to have
figured out that he can throw some chum in the water and get a bunch of
great feedback. It makes his blog one of the best on the Interwebs. <a
href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/strange-new-respect-for-the-national-front/#new_comments"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comment #13 in this thread</a> is a good
example.

*It’s funny how most men are fine with homosexuals being homosexuals as
long as they agree to the unwritten rule that they keep it out of public
life. This seems to be our natural and default position and it’s the
claim that “the personal is political” that is new and alien. A look at
the origin of the word “idiot” is instructive:*

*Idiot is a word derived from the Greek ἰδιώτης, idiōtēs (“person
lacking professional skill”, “a private citizen”, “individual”), from
ἴδιος, idios (“private”, “one’s own”).\[1\] In Latin the word idiota
(“ordinary person, layman”) preceded the Late Latin meaning “uneducated
or ignorant person”.\[2\]*  
*\[….\]*

***An idiot in Athenian democracy was someone who was characterized by
self-centeredness and concerned almost exclusively with private—as
opposed to public—affairs.**\[6\] Idiocy was the natural state of
ignorance into which all persons were born and its opposite,
citizenship, was effected through formalized education.\[6\] In Athenian
democracy, idiots were born and citizens were made through education…*

*“The personal is political” is a post-1960s concept that seems to be
killing itself via Twitter as we speak. Give every silly girl the
ability to broadcast her every passing thought via Twitter and the
demand that we accept the personal as political drowns in its own
waste.*

I’m fond of pointing out that people join mass movements out of
self-loathing. They seek to swap their natural identity for that of the
group. It’s why the members of a movement compete with one another as to
who is the most committed. Inevitably this zealotry contest ends with
purges and maybe worse.

It’s also why Cultural Marxism so aggressively attacks the private space
of citizens. Privacy is a challenge. Someone who wishes to maintain a
private life has something to hide and therefore he may be a heretic.
You never know until you turn him inside out and look. Islam has a
similar suspicion of privacy, which is not a coincidence…

One of the things I love about Roman history is just how many
incompetent rulers they were able to muster, yet survive. People on the
rise accumulate a lot of cultural capital. In periods of bad rulers,
they live off that excess capital from a previous age. The Roman
Republic and a few early emperors accumulated a lot of cultural capital.

America is another story. The rulers from the Civil War through WW2
built a huge gap between America and the rest of the world. Conquering
Europe and Asia in one shot is no small thing. But, it does appear <a
href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/18/obama-humiliated-as-allies-join-chinas-asian-infra/#.VQs2wsWhx7Q.twitt"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the subsequent run of bad emperors is
frittering it away</a>. Obama will be remembered, I suspect, as a man
thrust into a position for which he was unqualified, thus hastening the
decline of the empire…

If you want to see how it ends for the Occident, <a
href="https://www.swedishweekly.com/license-plate-with-786-forbidden-might-offend-muslim-immigrants/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">it is right here in this story from
Sweden</a>. The religion of the West is a worship of the other. So much
so the other now has a veto over the daily life of the European. In
America, the cuckoldry is focused on black males, but in Europe it is
the Mohammedan…

The following tweet was in my twitter feed for some reason:

I have never heard of Pharrell Williams. I’m always amazed by the number
of famous people out there that are unknown to me. I bet I know no one
who knows who this is either. But, someone does  as he has become
fabulously rich at something…

Finally, the Cult has been tub thumping about <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/sports/tennis/this-time-serena-williams-is-cheered-as-she-leaves-indian-wells.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this story</a> for a week or more. Indian
Wells has finally been redeemed as the steroidal Williams sisters made
their triumphant return to the place formerly filled with black-hearted
racists. I could not fathom why this was a such a big deal to the
NYTimes. They have been covering it like an election.

Then it occurred to me that anti-racism has turned a corner. It is no
longer about chasing after the blue-eyed devils. It is about the worship
of black people now. They have become the chosen people of the American
Left. The triumphant return of the Williams sisters is symbolic of the
triumph of this weird new cult built around the worship of black people…
