<span id="articleText"><span class="focusParagraph">Dinesh
D’Souza</span></span> is popular with the Official Right these days, but
that says more about the Official Right than D’Souza. There will be
plenty of columns tomorrow from the usual suspects about the unfairness
of <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prosecuting D’Souza</a>.

*Conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza was sentenced on
Tuesday to spend eight months in a community confinement center during
five years of probation after pleading guilty to a campaign
<span class="mandelbrot_refrag">finance</span> law violation.*

*The defendant, a frequent critic of President
<span class="mandelbrot_refrag">Barack Obama</span>, was sentenced by
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan. He was also given a
$30,000 fine and ordered to do one day of community service a week
during his probation.*

*D’Souza, 53, admitted in May to illegally reimbursing two ‘straw
donors’ who donated $10,000 each to the unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate
campaign in New York of Wendy Long, a Republican he had known since
attending Dartmouth College in the early 1980s.*

*“It was a crazy idea, it was a bad idea,” D’Souza told Berman before
being sentenced. “I regret breaking the law.”*

*Prosecutors had sought a 10-to 16-month prison sentence, rejecting
defense arguments that D’Souza was “ashamed and contrite” about his
crime and deserved probation with community service.*

In fairness, it is grossly unjust what’s going on here. The people in
charge are rampaging though the law with impunity. This guy gets sent to
the can for what was a minor offense. If he was just some guy, of
course, no one would care. He’s buddies with the big shots of
Conservative Inc so they will be making a big deal of it. The safe bet
is they stage a cry in for the guy or start crying “racism!”

The trouble wit this pity party is this. D’Souza has always been a
backstabbing fink and an opportunist. When conservatism was more
nationalist, he was a Reagan firebrand. When the neocons took over, he
was right there with them. Now that the Right is all worked up over
Obama, he’s going to be the most unhinged Obama hater and for only
$49.95 you can get his book and latest DVD. In the end, it is always
about moving product for him.

The real sin is that D’Souza stabbed in the back one of the great
conservative polemicists of his generation. Back in the 1990’s, he took
money to do a hit piece on Sam Francis for the neocons that ultimately
got the man fired. Francis was his own worst enemy, but you don’t take a
contract from the enemy to whack a member of your own family and remain
in the family. For that, D’Douza can never be forgiven.
