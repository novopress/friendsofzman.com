Back when the Covid-19 panic started, a clever fellow pointed out that
one possible way out of it would be a vaccine that did not work, but
with enough effort could convince people it did work. The rulers could
claim it is 80% effective at preventing infection and there would be no
way to know it was a lie based on medical statistics. The vaccinated who
got Covid would just be those for whom the vaccine did not work. If the
producer could keep the secret, no one would be the wiser.

The reason for this is simple math. The claims about the infectiousness
of this virus were always nonsense. A year of aggressive testing has
<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">resulted</a> in about 10% of the public having tested
positive. We know that the
<a href="https://wmbriggs.com/post/32738/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">false positives</a> are very high, but we also know many
infected people never get tested. Either they have no idea they have
been infected or their symptoms are so mild they ignore it. Like the
flu, Covid can be expected to infect around 20% of the public in a year.

If your vaccine is 80% effective, then that 20% is miraculously
accurate. A clever ruler could roll out a fake vaccine and claim it is
doing as it claims. The gullible media and research community would fall
for it completely. Unless someone in on the scam spilled the beans, no
one would know. In the age where the media is just the marketing
department for the corporate state, whistleblowers are ignored. Given
the money involved, a fake vaccine program is not a bad bet.

One problem with this scheme is that Covid quickly went from genuine
public health concern to lucrative racket. Billions are being made
maintaining the panic. It turns out that reorganizing the economy around
lock downs is hard to reverse. Then you have the celebrity Covidians.
Guys like Dr. Fauci are never going to let go of this thing as it is
making him famous and rich. Of course, Covid is now a stock part of the
media, like the weather or the previous night’s sports scores.

Then you have the Covidian problem. The fervent, but mentally unstable,
have gravitated to the Covid panic as a new religion. The people who
used to carry their groceries in grimy canvas sacks in order to show
their love of Gaia are now wearing eight masks when alone in their car.
They really care and they really care most about making sure you know
how much they care. Take away their masks and they have no way to tell
you how much they care.

This has created a perfect storm. The racketeers are pushing the
vaccine, but also saying that nothing changes. Once everyone is
vaccinated, according to people like Fauci, everyone will still have to
wear masks, stand an arbitrary distance from one another, and carry on
like the atmosphere is poisonous. This pleases the Covidians no end, who
arf like seals at this idea. Millions are rushing off to be vaccinated
so they can keep wearing masks and staying home.

Since most of the media has now joined the Church of Covid, they are
looking for proof that their plans for your future are science! [This
story](https://archive.is/860bW) from the New York Times says a member
of the unclean caused a pandemic among the faithful, despite the fact
they had performed the proper sacraments. They were vaccinated and they
were wrapped in layers of shrink wrap. Despite that, the mere presence
of an unclean made Covid angry and she took out her wrath on the nursing
home.

A reasonable person would look at this and wonder why anyone is
bothering to get vaccinated when you still get sick. In fact, many
people are wondering why we bothered with the vaccine at all, given that
everyone will have to keep pretending this is the zombie apocalypse. We
stopped using the iron lung and lumbar punctures once the polio vaccine
was created. That is the point of a vaccine. You get vaccinated so you
are no longer at high risk of contracting the targeted disease.

Of course, the Covidians are never giving up on this new religion, so
their take is that the vaccine only works when the sinners are forced to
be vaccinated. Again, it is not science with these people, even though
they are fond of telling us how much they trust science, peace be upon
her. You see, this miracle of science only works when everyone believes
in it. If just one heretic refuses the blessed sacrament of vaccination,
the whole community, maybe the whole world, is at risk!

Those with a taste for history cannot help but notice the Puritan notion
of communal salvation running through this panic. The idea that a
community can be brought low by the presence of a lone sinner has been
with us since the beginning. It was the justification for the witch
trials. Today it is the justification for the
[media](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-police-officer-fired-after-donating-kyle-rittenhouse-defense-fund-n1264783)
destroying the lives of people who donate money to the wrong sinner.
Soon, the unvaccinated will be forced to wear a scarlet letter-C on
their chest.

The Covid panic has revealed the real plague on American society. It is
the plague of mentally unstable individuals searching for a purpose to
their lives. These are people who would have been religious fanatics in
another age. In this age, their disordered minds cause them to seek the
order of ideology. Toting around grimy canvas sacks, displaying pronouns
on their e-mail signature and wearing eight masks in the car are about
the need for structure to give them a sense of order.

Does any of this mean the vaccine is fake? Probably not. The drug
companies are craven enough to try it. The media is dumb enough and
cynical enough to go along with what they are told, but none of these
people are creative enough to think of it. The more likely scenario is
the drug makers dummied up their studies knowing the FDA was under
pressure to play along. These vaccines are probably not all that
effective and probably less effective for the old than the young.

Allowing crazy people to call the shots is never a good idea. Time will
tell if it was a good idea to vaccinate the public with a hastily
conceived vaccine. It took about five years before the monstrous effects
of [thalidomide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide) became
clear. Five years from now the same people lecturing us about mask
wearing could very well be lecturing us about the dangers of allowing
untested drugs onto the market. The solution to their current panic will
be the cause of their future panic.
