One of the consequences of the unfolding revelations in Washington is
that we must reexamine the past in light of this new data. We now know
that the political process was captured by the Blob and used to serve
the Blob. That means the alleged policies of past presidents were
probably not their policies at all. They were simply staying ahead of
the policies put forth by the Blob.

At the same time, much of what we want government to do has gotten worse
as the Blob has assumed control. Name a problem and not only has it
gotten worse, but the cost of addressing it has grown out of control.
One great example is the war on drugs that has tracked closely with the
growth of the Blob. The cost of fighting it has spiraled out of control,
while the problem has only grown worse.

It is the nature of managerialism to look for things to manage, but
managing is not the same as solving or even mitigating. You cannot
remain a manager if what the problem you are tasked to manage gets
solved. In fact, solving the issue is exactly what you must seek to
avoid, which means you become part of the problem. This is what we have
seen with the drug war going back to the Reagan years.

That is the show this week. It is a dive into the rabbit hole of the
drug war to try and explain how the drug menace is the result of
managerialism. At every stop along the way, government either
deliberately or incompetently advanced the flow of drugs into the
country and the diversity of drugs available. The reason we did not have
a drug epidemic a century ago is we did not have managerialism a century
ago.
