The Kyle Rittenhouse trial has gone to the jury after both sides
presented their closing arguments and the state presented its rebuttal.
Wisconsin stacks the deck against the accused by not only allowing the
state the final word but giving them a chance to address the closing
argument of the accused. That means before the jury got the case, they
had to sit through a long day of the state making unfounded claims about
their case as well as the case of the defense team.

Putting that aside, the trial has not exactly riveted the country, but
it has become a symbol of the problems facing America. For example,
there were the howler monkeys of the new religion writhing in agony
whenever the judge enforced the basic rules of criminal procedure.
Immediately they labeled the judge a white supremacist fascist and
issued a fatwa against him. The death threats came pouring in and he is
now under police protection. Welcome to America.

Twitter sponsored people on their platform calling for volunteers to
show up at the court and get the names and faces of the jurors. This is
not an official Twitter position, but as a publisher, they chose to
allow their members to post these calls. In a sane society they would be
liable for the people they boost on their platform. In present day
America corporations are immune from all consequences. As long as they
are true believers, they can do as they please.

On the other side of this you have people slowly waking up to the
reality of the situation, who are glued to the case. They hold out hope
that the jury does the moral thing and clears Rittenhouse of all
charges. They do not want to see an innocent man condemned for holding
the wrong opinions, but mostly they do not want to see the ugly reality
of this age piled onto the head of a baby-faced young man. This trial
offends the decency of the remaining honest men in this society.

For those who have had their awakening long ago, this trial is a
continuation of the trend that now defines society. On the one hand we
have America descending into a great terror aimed at the white
population. The new religion is all about vengeance against white
people. Juxtaposed to this are the people who see it, trying to find
some way to wake up the rest of the people. This trial is another
example of the aware desperately trying to warn the world.

Of course, that brings up the confused audience in this tragic drama.
Most white people are trying to avoid looking at this trial. The
grotesque nature of it turns their stomach, as it should. The ugliness
of the human condition is on display. There are the savage calls for mob
vengeance and the cruelty of fanaticism. This trial is a human sacrifice
carried out by a mob of fanatical lunatics. Most white people thought we
had evolved beyond this sort of thing. Welcome to America.

It is a good reminder of something said by John Stuart Mill. “Let not
any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if
he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to
compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He
is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed
in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he
will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject.”

This has been the story of the last five years. The overwhelming
majority of people in America, regardless of race or national origin,
just want to live quiet lives enjoying the benefits of their
circumstances. They are Burkean conservatives in that they do not want
to flip over the tables and begin anew. That understandable and
justifiable desire for stability and normalcy easily gives way to
passivity in the face of evil. The story of the last five years is a
nation of good men doing nothing.

This trial is probably a pivot point. The good men looking away do so
with the certainty that their fellow citizens on the jury will do the
right thing. They still trust the system even though they see the
systemic corruption. If the jury sends this young man to prison many
more eyes will be opened to the reality of this age. Not all, as some
people put all of their efforts to remaining blissfully unaware. Theirs
is a life of willful ignorance and a selfish disregard for the suffering
of others.

On the other hand, the just verdict will allow most people to extend
their holiday from reality a bit longer. They will comfort themselves in
the belief that the system still works, despite what they have seen.
Like a high wire performer who miraculously survives a fall and returns
to his act, these people will learn nothing. Thoreau was right about
most men living quiet lives of desperation. It is just that most men
desperately wish to live outside of the great currents of history.

For those who have made the journey to this side of the great divide and
see things as they are, this trial is just another opportunity. If the
jury does the right thing, then the issue is why this kid was persecuted
by these ghouls. If he is found guilty then the issue is the grotesque
injustice at the hands of a savage mob of fanatics. The dissident is an
opportunist, using every event to press a partisan case. The Rittenhouse
case is just one more story in a long struggle for Western civilization.
