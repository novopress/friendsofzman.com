A regular feature of the internet age is the emergence of what is called
a “new right” that is supposed to supplant the “old right.” This is
largely due to the collapse of Buckley-style conservatism over the last
twenty years. The assumption is that the failures of mainstream
conservatism and its dwindling demographic must lead to its demise and
its replacement by a new, more contemporary right. As a result, there
have been a lot of hats thrown into the ring from alternative rights.

What may be emerging as the real threat to win the competition is
something that has yet to name itself. The recent hit piece on the
publisher of Passage Press, the group responsible for rehabilitating
Steve Sailer, led to a gathering of online friends and acquaintances in
support of the publisher. This is the online character known as
[Lomez](https://twitter.com/L0m3z), who has written for Claremont sites
and has a big following on Twitter. He is part of a loose network of
influencers that could be called the Cosmo Right.

That is the first place to start with understanding this collection of
people emerging into a movement of sorts. They are cosmopolitan in the
old bourgeois sense of the word, as they often live in or around the
trendy cities. Maybe they went to a college that is near a trendy city
or they worked at a company in a hipsterville. Maybe they just like to
hang out in places like Austin. It is not so much about location when it
comes to their cosmopolitanism, but their attitude.

These are people comfortable in and around the people David Brooks
called bourgeois bohemians or Bobo’s. Brooks described them as highly
educated people who enjoy the aesthetic of the creative world but pay
for it by successfully maintaining a position in the competitive modern
economy. Twenty years ago, when he wrote his book about these people,
the Bobo’s were a white couple who lived in a gentrified part of the
Five Burroughs but had jobs in Manhattan.

This potential new right that is forming up seems to be mostly people
who have drifted in and out of that world. They come from generally
upper middle-class backgrounds, went to college, and entered a
profession. Finding the meritocratic world stifling and sterile, they
have been looking around for something more fulfilling and that is not
limited to their lifestyle. Their politics are the result of waking up
from neoliberalism and then searching about for alternatives.

A representative example is the Blaze writer and commentator Auron
MacIntyre, whose
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Total-State-Liberal-Democracies-Tyrannies/dp/1684515580)
*The Total State* reads like a personal journey out of the world of
conventional politics into the wilderness of dissident politics. Instead
of going down the usual rabbit holes which is so common when people get
red-pilled on politics, he has maintained a foot in the world of
conventional politics, often normalizing ideas that first gained
traction in the shadows of dissident discourse.

This gets to the natural trendiness with this new scene. This new right
is composed of people comfortable in a world that is often defined by
trends, so they do not get swept up in whatever is happening at the
moment. In other words, this is a conservatism of disposition, rather
than of ideology. Scan the posts of the site
[IM1776](https://im1776.com/all-posts/) and you get a Russel Kirk vibe
from it. The focus is not on a political agenda, but more on analysis
and the proper positioning of politics with the personal.

This is also a millennial demographic. Zoomers get a lot of attention
due to their shenanigans online and their skillful use of digital media,
but this new scene is almost exclusive to people from the millennial
cohort. Like the Zoomers, they come from the suburban middle-class, but
unlike the Zoomers they went onto college and got jobs in the above
ground economy. Their politics are the result of that experience in the
world of practical things, rather than the internet fever swamps.

Another interesting and novel aspect is that this ad hoc collection of
people can be described as post-national, post-racial and post-regional.
They are all what Leonard Jeffries would call “ice people” but there is
no emphasis on it. It is a lot like the old paleo-conservatism in that
there are a lot of secular Jews and conservative Christians from
mainstream sects. You also see a mix of people from different regions
with a regional focus, but not exclusively so.

This is the new cosmopolitanism that may be the result of the
demographic changes sweeping the Western world. The old racial
categories no longer work because it is no longer a world of black and
white. The majoritarian outlook no longer works as there is no longer a
natural majority. The response to multiracial neoliberalism may be a
cosmopolitan conservatism rooted in classical Western attitudes. The
answer to the new Mercurians will be new Apollonians.

There is also the fact that it is young and educated. These are not
people with warmed over political agendas from the past, but young,
educated men reexamining the past for the foundations of a new political
foundation. That means it is less a political agenda than a cultural
movement. There is a cool factor growing up around these people on
social media, which brings in new voices and new ideas. That gives this
new scene a vitality missing from prior new right initiatives.

Of course, this could just be another ripple in the river that is the
political in the mass media age. This is not the first effort at
creating an alternative to the shuffling husk that is Buckley-style
conservatism. The difference here is that this emerging new subculture
is not a deliberate creation. Unlike Hazony’s newfangled nationalism,
the Cosmo-Right is an organic thing that is emerging gradually.
Therefore, it may have more staying power because it is not built to
replace anything.
