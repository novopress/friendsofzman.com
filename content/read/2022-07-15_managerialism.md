Arguably, one of the most important political concepts to come out of
the 20th century was James Burnham’s theory of managerialism. It is
important mostly because it is a set of accurate observations that allow
for a further understanding of what is happening in Western societies
since the Second World War. Once you understand that our society is
organized like a corporation, with senior management and a large layer
of middle-management, things make much more sense.

The trouble is most people do not want to see this. Instead, they
indulge in reductionist theories about secret cabals manipulating the
system. Others pretend that the system is what is advertised and you
just have to vote harder. Still others insist we have drifted into
something randomly called socialist, Marxist or communist, not because
the system possesses these qualities, but because those words are
epithets. Despite being incredibly useful, the concept is hardly used.

One reason for this is the managerial class controls access to that
which has value in modern society. If you want your ideas to get heard,
you must pass muster with the people who keep the gates of the system.
Just as in a corporation, you are not going to get to speak your mind
around the bosses if they are not going to like what you have to say
about them. Management always gets conservative about its position
within the organization which means it is naturally defensive.

Another reason this idea languishes on the fringe is that most political
commentary comes from mediocrities excluded from the elite track. The
commentariat is populated with people unqualified to run a hotdog stand.
As you see in the dreaded private sector, middle-management tends to be
a cheering section in this system. Unlike a private company, the
managerial class never has to worry about making a profit, so the
cheering section can be stuffed to the gills.

There is also the fact that the commentariat is devoid of people who
have experience in the dreaded private sector. Someone like [Sohrab
Ahmari](https://compactmag.com/article/what-the-right-doesn-t-get-about-the-labor-left)
struggles to understand managerialism because he never read the source
material and he has no idea what goes on inside a company. He cannot see
the parallels between the corporation and the corporate state. It is
extremely hard to use a concept when you do not understand it and lack
the capacity to comprehend it.

Interestingly, the people at the top of the managerial class and
especially those seeking to reach the top are ignorant of the concept.
They have achieved class consciousness to the extent that they naturally
identify with the others in their class. They mark themselves with their
dress, their language and political beliefs. The latter jumps out at the
lower ranks where they tend to embrace the most extreme versions of
elite opinion as a way to gain attention from the bosses.

The idea that animates the people in the system comes from Gramsci. They
seek to control the centers of cultural production and they are aware of
it. They want to control official truth in all areas of society. They do
not see themselves as controlling access to and the benefits that are
derived from property, capital or information, even though that is
exactly what they are doing. Controlling institutions is about
controlling access to what is valuable within the domain of the
institution.

This means the managerial class has achieved class consciousness, in
that they consciously identify with those in their class. They see
themselves as distinct from the rest of society. On the other hand, they
suffer from false consciousness in that they think they are motivated by
altruistic reasons, like the spread of liberal democracy, individual
freedom and equality. In reality, these social causes are a defense
mechanism to protect their power over society.
