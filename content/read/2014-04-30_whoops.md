The Left was preparing to re-run the Summer of Recovery to boost their
electoral chances this fall. The fourth quarter GDP was not horrible,
but not great either. All of the usual suspects had convinced themselves
that the economy was finally getting off the mat and headed for a boom.
Unemployment claims we slowing and the number of posted jobs was
increasing. Happy days were here again!

*The U.S. economy slowed drastically in the first three months of the
year as a harsh winter exacted a toll on business activity. The
slowdown, while worse than expected, is likely to be temporary as growth
rebounds with warmer weather.*

*Growth slowed to a barely discernible 0.1 percent annual rate in the
January-March quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was
the weakest pace since the end of 2012 and was down from a 2.6 percent
rate in the previous quarter.*

*Many economists said the government’s first estimate of growth in the
January-March quarter was skewed by weak figures early in the quarter.
They noted that several sectors — from retail sales to manufacturing
output — rebounded in March. That strength should provide momentum for
the rest of the year.*

That’s right, the weather. It is usually sunny and warm in winter but
for some strange reason it was cold this winter. That’s why everyone
stopped doing stuff.

*And on Friday, economists expect the government to report a solid
200,000-plus job gain for April.*

America adds about 2 million people to the adult population each year,
after accounting for deaths and immigration. That means the job market
has to grow accordingly. Adding 200,000 jobs a month is treading water.
That’s why this graph never gets on TV:

But hey, why not bring in another twenty or thirty million Latino
peasants to do the jobs Americans won’t do? That’s fix this stagnant
economy!
