I’m fond of the Hoffer quote regarding how mass movements degenerate
into rackets. The exact quote is, “What starts out here as a mass
movement ends up as a racket, a cult, or a corporation.” Drunk driving
is the greatest example of this. We have done all that can or should be
done to address drunk driving, but MADD remains a multi-million dollar
jobs racket for its members. What little good it does is undone by the
fact it now advocates for the violation of basic civil liberties.

In his day, this probably encapsulated the possible outcomes of a mass
movement living beyond its purpose. Today, there is another possible
option in addition to business, racket and cult and that is mental
illness. All over we are seeing causes turn into collection points for
the mentally ill to advocate for issues that are best described as
insane. The whole trannies in the bathroom stuff is the most obvious
example. This is lunacy advocated for the sole reason of causing mayhem.

Feminism is a another good example of a cause becoming a lunatic cult.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism"
target="_blank">First Wave Feminism</a> was fairly small bore in its
goals and tactics. The gals wanted to vote and have the same legal
rights as men. Judging from the photos in history books, the tactics
back then were for the feminists protesters to make themselves as
sexually unappealing as possible in order to force the guys to concede.
It was a mistake to give into these demands, but it probably seemed
rational at the time.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism"
target="_blank">Second Wave Feminism</a> was proof that women, lacking a
man around to say no, will begin to commit suicide by destroying the
culture that allows them to prosper. That it quickly degenerated into
Third Wave Feminism is all the proof you need. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism"
target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a> for Third Wave Feminism is mostly
just word salad because there’s no way to provide a concise description
of what amounts to a grab bag of outburst by mentally ill women. <a

One thing that the New Religion inherited from the Marxists is the
concept of the struggle. It is integral to their identity to believe
they are in a life or death struggle with dark, mysterious forces. This
is what allows the blue-haired cat ladies of modern feminism to claim
they are being oppressed, because the rest of us don’t care about their
eating disorder. At the individual level, it is just another log on the
fire of the raging bonfire of lunacy between the ears of the typical
young woman.

The trouble is, these unhinged gals are rampaging through the culture
and coming to dominate the managerial class, which means their mental
illness is turned into official policy. Scroll down through the list of
recommendations in the linked piece and you will see this gem:

What this is, of course, is a Factitious Disorder, which means a
self-imposed condition or illness. Third Wave Feminism is about
searching for pitiable people for whom the feminist can feel suffering
by proxy. It’s a way for unattached, childless women to gain attention.
The normal biological urges no longer have the constructive cultural
channels through which to flow to their natural destination, motherhood
and marriage. Instead, like a blocked river, these urges flow into
unwanted areas and put society at risk.

I’m fond of pointing out that the Muslims are not wrong about
everything. The sterile materialism of the West is antithetical to
normal human organization, theirs and ours. They are also right about
the role of women in society. I’m not talking about the over-the-top
Islamic views on women we see on TV. I mean the more sober Islam where
women have a defined role that is different from that of men. “Equality”
does not mean “identical” and women can have an equal place in society,
without having an identical role.

It’s why the way to bet is for the Muslim invasion of  the West to
result in the Islamification of the West or at least the rise of a
mutated form of Islam in the West. Given the choice between the yapping
of fruitless young woman and men with beards throwing infidels off of
roofs, the latter will be much more appealing to the men of the
West. Maybe it will not come to that, but a society run by broken women
cannot last. Either the women get fixed or someone throws a bag over
their head and a net over the rest of us for allowing it.
