Given the fanaticism of the managerial class, most political topics are
useful only in sorting people into political buckets. Liberals support
“taxing the rich” while conservatives oppose “socialism”. The only thing
that matters in these “debates” is which side you are on as nothing is
ever debated. In fact, the debate around the topic looks more like a
distraction. The point of the debate is to provide cover for what is
happening behind the scenes between pols and their handlers.

While those ceremonial debates are useless, there are some issues that
are useful, because they reveal truths about the system and the people
in it. Firearms policy is one of those issues. The 2A community in
America is large and extremely well informed on the topic of guns and
gun laws. Knowing the rules is an important part of every subculture
within the gun community. Knowing the local laws is often a prerequisite
for entry into the community, so the members are highly informed.

This is one reason the Left struggles with the issue. The Left wins when
they can claim the moral high ground, because that means Conservative
Inc. will fold up like a cheap tent and beg for forgiveness. Part of
seizing the moral high ground though is claiming a thoroughgoing
knowledge of the issue. The reason the Left is festooned with barnacles
claiming to be policy experts is so they can claim a mastery of the
topic. This lets them say “we know best” and push through their
policies.

With guns, this is not possible. All of the facts work against gun
grabbing. Whether it is the mythological gun show loophole or the
assault weapon ban, any discussion of the issue quickly reveals the Left
knows nothing about guns. In fact, it is like they make a point of not
knowing anything about guns or gun laws. They say insane things that
even the sympathetic find cringe inducing. One result is the people in
favor of gun grabbing tend to come off as ignorant fanatics.

The gun issue is useful in another way. All of those normies on the
other side of the divide think that facts matter when dealing with the
Left. Gun grabbing is a great issue to show them that facts really do
not matter much at all. No matter how many times they explain the facts
of firearms to these people, they will keep chanting the slogans from
their cult about guns. The reason for that is the Left is about
morality, their morality, not facts or reason. They are the anointed, so
facts do not matter.

[Here is an example](https://archive.is/JrkXJ) of how a sense of moral
superiority is what really matters, rather than factual accuracy or
rational debate. Taken at face value, it would mean Arne Duncan knows
nothing about guns or voting. There has never been a time when voting
was more difficult than buying a gun. In fact, voting has always been
easier than doing pretty much anything. The most difficult part of
voting today is not vomiting all over the voting booth when looking at
the choices on offer.

Now, Arne Duncan is not just another airhead on Twitter. He is a very
special airhead, who is the executive director of something called the
Emerson Collective. This is a not-for-profit founded by the widow of
Steve Jobs. They are another monastery in the ruling class theological
framework, promoting the usual stuff. Amusingly, Arne Duncan wrote a
book titled, [How Schools
Work](https://www.amazon.com/How-Schools-Work-Longest-Serving-Secretaries/dp/1501173057),
which is his firsthand account of how he was a terrible Secretary of
Education during the Obama years.

Note his [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/arneduncan). He has a
picture of himself with a gaggle of black people, which is supposed to
tell us he is a member of the anointed. He is such a good guy; black
people just want to be around him. Sure, he lives in a gated,
whites-only neighborhood with a bunch of other rich white people, but
the brothers just love him. The picture would be better if he were
wearing a pith helmet and a safari outfit. His act is the modern version
of the white man’s burden, without doing any heavy lifting.

That was the point of his tweet. In fact, it is the point of his entire
life. He and his fellow travelers on the Progressive carny circuit are
all about their virtue. He does not have to be troubled with facts about
voting and gun laws, for example. Those are for the servant class to
quarrel over. Arne has a dream, a dream where everyone gets a ballot,
even the imaginary, and those votes are dutifully ignored. The point of
democracy is so worthless layabouts like Arne Duncan can express their
moral superiority.

For the most part, it is a pointless waste of time for dissidents to
engage in the nuts and bolts of political discourse. Most issue are of
the first type, where the debates are about signaling your team
affiliation. Some issues, like the gun issue, are useful in that they
can be used to reveal to the open minded, the reality of liberal
democracy. After all, what is the point of engaging with someone like
Arne Duncan, who is a noxious blend of breathtaking stupidity and
sanctimonious codswallop?

It goes beyond that though. The people behind these ridiculous
operations like the Emerson Collective are not interested in making
society better. The widow Jobs just wants some grace on the cheap. She
has plenty of money, so she can underwrite this stuff, because it makes
a nice addition to her moral charm bracelet. Nothing about the Emerson
Collective is about helping people. It is about boosting the ego of the
people involved, by letting them pretend they are on the side of angels.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
