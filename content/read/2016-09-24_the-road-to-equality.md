If your culture believes, as an article of faith, that the gods control
the weather, you will always assume the gods are behind the changes in
the weather. If it rains, it is because the gods want it to rain.
Naturally, you will want the right weather at the right time. For
example, you will want rain in the spring, but not too much rain. You
will want just enough to have a good planting season, so you and your
people will come up with ways to please the gods. Maybe that is some
sort of offering or a certain ceremony held at a special place.

If you do all the rituals and make all the right sacrifices, but the
weather sucks, you will naturally assume the gods are angry, meaning
something is wrong. Maybe the rituals were not done properly or maybe
someone in the village has been secretly committing some sin that is
angering the gods. After all, what else could it be? The gods make the
weather so if the weather is bad, the gods must be angry. Therefore,
someone or something must be making them angry. The solution is to find
the witch!

Modern people tend to laugh at the rubes from the past, who believed
such things, but the people in charge of our modern world pretty much
believe the same sorts of oogily-boogily. <a

How is blaming racism for the test scores any different than blaming the
gods or evil spirits? In all of those cases, the cause is some
mysterious force that you just have to accept on faith. In this case,
the article of faith is not that the gods cause weather. It is that all
people are born with the exact same abilities. Even though no one can
point to actual racist acts, racism has to be the reason for why the
black kids score below the white kids. After all, what else could it be?
The kids are the same so it must be the school!

It is is not irrational for this airhead school board woman to say these
things. This is the inevitable end of the blank slate egalitarianism
preached by our elites. If everyone is born the same, capable of
everything everyone is able to do, then the differing outcomes must be
due to the process. What else could it be? Further, if the black kids
are always scoring at the bottom, then the schools must be unfairly
shortchanging the black kids and that’s racism. Again, it is all
perfectly logical as long as you believe the magic in the premise.

It is, to no small degree, the root of the war on white males,
particularly in the schools. Despite all the efforts to get girls into
STEM fields, for example, males and particularly white males seem to
take up most of the spots. Yeah, Asians do well too, but they do so
despite the lynch mobs chasing them down the streets of San Francisco.
No one is chasing the honky boys, so they must be cheating and the only
way to remedy that is to give them a penalty. Again, it is not crazy, as
long as you accept the madness of the premise.

It is this lack of doubt, the unwillingness to accept any doubt, that
led the commies to murder so many people. After all, their system was
the model of perfection. The reason it failed was the people, so the
logical solution was to get rid of the people gumming up the works. The
evangelical egalitarians that rule over us are heading down the same
path as the old commies. Instead of murdering the enemies of the
revolution, they just destroy their careers and reputations. Whether or
not we end up in a place imagined by Kurt Vonnegut in
<a href="http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html"

anyway.
