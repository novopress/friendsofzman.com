When I was at the Mencken Club conference, I was at Paul Gottfried’s
table the first night and it occurred to me I should do a show on
fascism. I don’t mean the cartoon fascism popular with some elements of
the alt-right or the erotic fantasy version popular with the American
Left. I mean historic fascism that actually thrived and existed in
Europe during the interwar years. I got a lot of compliments on the
shows covering libertarianism and democracy, so I thought I should try
to do a big-brained show at least one a month.

What occurred to me at dinner that night is Paul’s book,* Fascism: The
Career of a Concept*, would be a great skeleton key for a podcast. The
book is a short, general survey of the topic and the academic arguments
surrounding fascism. It’s also largely free of discussion of You Know
Who. The Nazis were a crude implementation of fascism that lacked the
intellectual depth you see in other fascist movements. They get all the
attention for a a number of reasons, but they are anything but the
exemplar of the movement.

The result this week is a very general introduction to the topic, along
with a very general survey of the main themes. Because we don’t live in
a serious age or a serious country, most people know nothing about one
of the more important ideological movements of the last century. The
goal here is to focus on the high points, without getting too far into
the weeds. I have a bunch of links in the contents section for those
interested in following up on the books and people mentioned. Obviously,
this is a highly abbreviated survey.

Now, as an aside, Counter-Currents has been positing a history of the
alt-right that is not entirely unrelated to the topic here. The
alt-right has tried to imagine itself as the fascist alternative to the
cult-Marx mobs of Antifa. They are wrong about that, but the back story
of the movement makes for a fun read anyway, so I encourage people to
read it. The four part post is <a

href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2018/11/what-is-the-alternative-right-part-4/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.There are a few things in there
that were new to me and some things that I had forgot. Some of it is
quite amusing, so give it a read,

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
