One of the interesting elements to the Tucker Carlson story is that no
one knows why he was fired, but lots of people are sure they know why he
was fired. The only thing from Fox so far has been a brief statement in
which they announced his departure and thanked him for his service to
the company. Carlson made a short video from his home studio telling his
fans that everything is going to be fine. Otherwise, there is nothing
solid on which to base a theory.

The best reason so far was the first reason. The timing suggested it had
something to do with the lawsuit Fox was forced to settle with Dominion
over their coverage of the election shenanigans. Facing a rigged trial,
Fox agreed to pay Dominion an absurd amount of money for hurting their
feelings and the feelings of the crazies who demand we believe Joe Biden
is more popular than Jesus. Right after they made the deal, Tucker and
Dan Bongino get fired.

Given the nastiness of the people who chant “election denier” it is
perfectly reasonable to think they would demand a pound of flesh from
Fox. Many of the crazies jumped on this idea because it made them feel
like winners. On the other hand, the Murdoch clan may have decided that
they were dragged into this mess by people like Carlson, so they were
going to purge the ranks of these people. Again, the timing of this is
what lends support to the claim Carlson was fired over the lawsuit.

This being the current year, it did not take long for new theories to
emerge. One was that Rupert Murdoch was spooked by Tucker’s <a
href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/did-tucker-preview-fox-exit-at-heritage-this-weekend"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">speech</a> at Heritage. Reportedly,
Rupert Murdoch freaks out when people mention God around him. Others
said Carlson’s candor about the news media in the speech is what did the
trick. The speech covered a lot of ground, so the people pushing this
theory were spoiled for choice. The speech was the last straw for the
Murdoch family.

A new theory has been dropped that suggests The Ukrainian dictator
Volodymyr Zelensky had Tucker fired. He supposedly had a <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12037437/Rupert-Lachlan-Murdoch-calls-President-Zelensky.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">call</a> with the Murdoch clan just
before they made the call on Tucker. The antiwar crowd has <a
href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/30/2023/the-murdochs-ukraine-connection"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">seized</a> on this story, claiming that
the Murdoch clan are either in bed with the dictator or they were
pressured by the regime to get rid of their most prominent war critics.
This does not explain the Bongino firing, but maybe that was unrelated.

The New York Times has now created a
<a href="https://archive.is/Bs8Oc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new
theory</a>. Someone at Fox News is leaking confidential company material
to regime media. These are texts that were produced in discovery during
the Dominion lawsuit. In one of the text, Carlson used the phrase “white
men” in a positive way. According to the anti-white bigots at the New
York Times, this was such an outlandish threat to “our democracy” the
Murdoch clan had no choice but to expel this heretic from their company.

Amusingly, the people the Times is fond of libeling are perfectly
willing to accept this as a valid theory for the firing of Tucker
Carlson.
<a href="https://twitter.com/KeithWoodsYT/status/1653677841030979585"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is Keith Woods on Twitter signal
boosting the theory. It is a great example of the Gell-Mann amnesia
effect. If the Times placed this story next to a story denying human
intelligence, the same people would point out all of the errors in the
latter but accept without question all of the claims in the former,
never noticing the contradiction.

The trouble with all of these theories is that they depend on the
assumption that Carlson is something different behind the scenes. This
is not a bad assumption since most entertainers are horrible people.
They play a role on television that is designed to attract an audience.
In real life, they are usually terrible people. In the case of Tucker,
the crazies think he wears a white sheet in his free time, while his
fans worry that maybe he does not wear a white sheet in his free time.

In reality, Carlson is pretty much what you see on television. If
anything, his on-air persona is more biting and tough than he is in real
life. Unlike most people in the media, he is a normal person in real
life. He is rich as hell, but he likes the things normal men enjoy, like
hobbies and time with his family. He is a rarity in conservative show
business in that he actually lives a conservative life. It is highly
unlikely that he says anything in private that is all that interesting.

What is really going on with these theories is that they provide an
escape from facing the underlying reality to this story. That reality is
the people at the top of American society not only all agree on the
important things, but they all agree that you are the real problem. What
defines people at the top of the managerial class is their disdain for
normal people. As a result, there is a tremendous amount of pressure on
members of the elite to conform to current fads.

Since Trump came down the escalator, the Murdoch family has been
subjected to the worst sort of social pressure. Despite their great
wealth, they still seek approval from their social class. The reason
they fired Tucker and will most likely turn Fox News into a gay version
of CNN is they simply grew tired of being pariahs. Maybe the lawsuit was
the final straw or maybe it was an innocuous thing, but they finally
decided they were tired of fighting and submitted to their mob.

This has been the story of the last eight years. Trump and his
supporters among the Cloud People have been viewed as traitors. The
antibodies of the ruling class have been at work isolating and then
expelling them. The Murdoch clan feared expulsion more than submission,
so they submitted. Tucker Carlson, on the other hand, has been expelled.
Soon, Trump and his followers will be expelled, and democracy will have
finally been cured of this terrible disease.
