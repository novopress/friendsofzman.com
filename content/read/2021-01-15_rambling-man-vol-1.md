Whenever I go on a livestream or do the letters show, I get e-mail from
people saying that the podcast should be more conversational. Instead of
reading and commenting upon articles, it should be more freewheeling.
These are probably a matter of taste, but there is some logic to the
suggestion. Listening to someone on a show or podcast is like being in a
conversation with them. The good interviewers are the voice of the
audience, asking the questions the listener would ask the guest.

As an experiment this year, I thought I would do a show a month where I
pick a few topics from the moment and say whatever comes to mind. No
prep. No notes. No set up using a news article. All I did this week is
take three topics that came up in my daily life and riff on them for the
show. There is no editing, other than to remove weird noises that come
up when you record from home. People may have noted the sirens from time
to time in the background of shows. Welcome to Lagos.

The one topic of the three that I could probably talked about for hours
is just how our rulers expect society to function under this new regime.
One thing I did not mention is the fact that somehow things have not
fallen apart already. It is going on a year now with the lock downs and
riots. They say half of all restaurants are gone for good and the small
retail sector is wiped out. The airlines are at 50% capacity and hotels
are below that in terms of occupancy. How is the economy still standing?

Now that The Pretender is about to be installed, I am assuming the
Democrats will start demanding everything open back up. They are that
shameless. Still, they spent a year convincing their drones that Covid
is the black death. Lots of people are now deeply invested in being
afraid. Turning the economy back on will not come easy. That and the
damage is mostly done at this point. If you are a business that survived
this, then you can keep surviving. It will take years for the lost to
recover.

The Pretender’s script writers say he will ask for a trillion dollar
relief bill, but given the mess that is Congress, that will not happen
easily. Mitch McConnell is a massive d-bag to everyone, not just his
voters. He will use every trick he can to hamstring it. The Dems are a
fractured party right now and we’ll see that clearly over this bill.
Even if they pass it, you can run a country this way. Throw in their
efforts to criminalize dissent and our rulers look like they are
carelessly smoking on a powder keg.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one

**Promotions:** The good folks at
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
