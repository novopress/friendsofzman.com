Most people on this side of the great divide have concluded that the
time for fixing what is broken in America has passed. The historical
processes that have been unleashed by past error will just have to run
their course. What comes after will be whatever the winners of the great
struggle create. What if that is not true and there is a window to stop
this process? What things could we do to break this cycle of madness
that seems to have gripped the American empire?

One thing that should be done right away for no other reason than to
slow things down is shutting off the mobile phone system. Humans evolved
to interact with one another in person, not through the virtual reality
of the mobile device. Everywhere you go you see people walking around
like zombies, glued to their phone. It is like the drug soma from the
novel Brave New World. The difference is this drug puts people into a
trance in which their senses are bombarded with data that irritate them.

One reason we have become an outrage culture is outrage is the only way
to get attention from others. In a world where people are linked to a
constant stream of images and bursts of text, getting noticed means
being outlandish of outrageous within those data streams. On the other
hand, being glued to the data stream leaves little room for real human
interaction and even less room for real emotion. Large swaths of the
population only feel human when they are outraged by the stream.

This would not be as difficult to do as you might think. The rulers
could impose a dollar per minute tax on the service. Sure, the wireless
firms would fight it, but the government has tanks and men with guns.
Shoot enough wireless executives and the rest either run away or fall in
line. The firm slap of authority is best conveyed against the wall of
the prison, after a quick trial. It was not that long ago when mobile
charges were prohibitive and very few people could afford a mobile
phone.

Similarly, the big social media platforms have become a problem. They
are nothing more than cauldrons of human misery now. Again, it was not
so long ago when these platforms did not exist. If we got rid of
Facebook and Twitter, the world does not change in any important ways.
People would simply migrate back to small private groups on-line or go
outside again. Turning off the big social platforms would have an
immediate positive impact on the psyche of the public.

Shutting these down would be easier than limiting the mobile device.
Enforcement of Section 230 along with new privacy laws that prohibit
them from harvesting your activity on-line would shut them down in
weeks. Once they are subject to the same laws as everyone else and they
cannot steal from their users, their business model would collapse in a
hurry. Small platforms would still exist, but as labors of love or as
small businesses run by one or two people with a narrow interest.

Another rollback would have to be the cameras. If you are out in public
and have a heart attack or you are attacked by a criminal, people pull
out their phones and begin taking pics of your suffering. They rather
hope you die so they can get a video that will go viral. Combined with
the cameras put up by the government and business, all of us now live in
a synopticon. This is a world where all of us are individually monitored
by all of us, a mass of camera wielding ghouls.

The solution here is your image is yours and you own it. Anyone
possessing your image or distributing your image without your express
permission is no different than someone trafficking in stolen goods. If
someone wants to post your bad day on-line, they need your permission.
The platform hosting it needs your permission. Otherwise, they are
liable for possessing your property without your permission. This would
also apply to security cameras. They can be used only in a courtroom.

This is not a novel concept. Many states still have laws on the books,
for example, against filming a public road. Movie companies used to need
permission to use video of people walking down a street. Your image used
to be your property. A big part of what ails us is we have allowed the
ownership of your information to fall into the public domain. Everywhere
you go someone is taking pictures of you and you have no control over
what they do with those images.

What is being proposed here, in effect, is rolling back the last 25
years of technological and economic change that no one contemplated,
debated, or voted on. This all just evolved quickly before anyone could
contemplate the impact. A generation long real-world experiment has
proven it was a bad idea. We have created a world of outraged shut-ins
and snitches. The only thing everyone agrees upon is that everyone hates
the world they experience, either in reality or through their device.

Would people riot in the streets if their phones suddenly became useful
only in emergencies as a way to call for help? Would there be protest
marches over the loss of Facebook and YouTube? Would Zoomers begin
forming militias when they can no longer video every moment of their
life with their phone? Obviously not, as these things did not happen
over Covid. In fact, people would adapt and maybe regrow the backbone
and spirit needed to protest such things.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
