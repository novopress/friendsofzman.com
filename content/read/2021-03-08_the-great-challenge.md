Note: The
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/topic/the_untold_story/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">weekly post</a> is up at Taki. This week it is about the
school system in Lagos and how it relates to right-wing politics. I had
some additional thoughts on the subject, which are

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the West, the state tends to reserve its harshest punishments for
those who break the law on purpose, with malice of forethought. The
murderer that carefully stalked and killed a guy who insulted him at the
bar gets a longer sentence than the guy who flew off the handle and
killed a guy in a bar fight. The underlying assumption is that the
former will kill again, because he chose to kill, while the latter is
unlikely to kill, because he did so only under unique conditions.

This seems obvious at first blush, but there is a counter argument. The
guy who flew off the handle and killed another man is not a rational
person. He killed for no reason, while the other guy thought about his
crime. Would you rather be in a room full of people who can fly off the
handle at any time and kill you or in a room full of men who kill under
specific conditions? In other words, committing a crime on purpose may
not always be worse than committing a crime through negligence or
impulse.

This is why so much of a criminal trial is about the motivations and the
circumstances of the crime versus the plain facts. The verdict and the
punishment are about public morality, not the facts of the crime. The
guy who thought about his crime before committing it may have had good
reasons to commit the crime. While we do not want people taking the law
into their own hands, we can understand it in the cases where the crime
comports with the moral code of society.

This sort of moral puzzle turns up in our politics. Last week [the House
passed](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/house-democrats-pass-bill-change-american-voting-forever)
an election “reform” bill. The point of the bill is to nationalize the
chaos and fraud we saw in many states during the last election. The game
of “pallets of ballots” showing up in the middle of the night will
become a 50-state phenomenon. The Democrats think that because they have
anathematized any discussion of election fraud, they can now
institutionalize it at the national level.

The motivation for this is the salient question. Some argue that it is
so they can win every election. This will give the Democrats and
presumably the institutional Left absolute power. Others argue that the
Left already has absolute power over the institutions, so the better
explanation is ideology. They truly believe they are in a twilight
struggle against the enemies of democracy. These reforms are part of the
battle against the dark forces that allegedly subverted the 2016
election.

For most right-leaning people, the first answer is more pleasant, so it
is the default option, even though the latter answer is more logical.
Right-leaning people have been conditioned to think about politics in
practical terms, even though left-wing people view politics in partisan
terms. Conservatives just cannot let go of the belief that people
operate from material self-interest. This mode of thought also leaves
open the possibility that the Left is correct or at least partially
correct.

This conundrum gets to the heart of the problem with the political
system. It has always been a trick played on the majority. By convincing
the majority of white people that the Left is always acting from cynical
self-interest, the implication is that there is a deal to be struck. If
the facts are made clear, then the Democrats will be reasonable either
to avoid being seen as acting from cynical self-interest or because they
see their interests lay in a bargain. Deal making is the highest virtue
of the Right.

This gets back to the moral question at the start, Conservatives have
concluded that logical evil is better than illogical evil. Part of their
reason to exist is to sell the claim that the Democrats and the Left are
rational actors, rather than partisans. They can promise to cut a deal
with the rational actor, no matter how cynical the motives. There is no
deal to be had with the partisan. The only deal to be made with a
partisan is one that he sees as advancing his partisan interests.

Just like the motivation question regarding murder, the morality of the
choices is not always clear when you look at the whole picture. The
default position in politics is that the Left knows it is acting in bad
faith. This self-awareness can be used to cut a deal, but why would
anyone want to cut a deal with them? At least with the partisan, there
is some chance they can be tricked into thinking a deal advances their
interests or maybe their interests actually have a positive outcome.

If you go back to the beginnings of conservatism, it started with the
premise that the other side was irredeemably wicked. If you watch
[Reagan’s speech](https://youtu.be/qXBswFfh6AY) on behalf of Barry
Goldwater in 1964, Reagan sounded like he was talking about pure evil
when he describes the politics of the Left. It is partisanship from the
Right, in which he reduces politics to good guys and bad guys. More
important, he excoriates his audience to be the good guys and be a
partisan. That is the point of the speech.

This is the great challenge in fashioning an alternative to
conservatism. The starting point must be that the Left, however defined,
is unreasonable. There can be no bargain with them, because bargains are
between reasonable parties. The point of right-wing politics is not
defending the established order from left-wing attacks. The point of
right-wing politics is to dispense with the moral distinction made by
conservatives and focus on removing left-wing politics from society.

It is tempting to dismiss the recent past, particular that of the
conservative movement, but there is a lesson to their failure. Whether
by choice or by subversion, they moved from the original partisan
position to a bourgeois rationalist position. Dissident politics must
return to the original position of the Right, armed with the knowledge
that anything undermining that binary view of the Left is as evil as the
Left itself. The solution to conservative obsequiousness is right-wing
radicalism.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
