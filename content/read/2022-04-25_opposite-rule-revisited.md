**Note \#1:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-fog-of-regime-ology/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. The topic is
somewhat related to the post today, but using the war as a jumping off
point. Because I was traveling over the weekend, no Sunday Thoughts
behind the green door, but I have a
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/589273" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">write up</a> of the VDare event posted there instead.
Later this week I will have a longer post on the event at the castle and
the issues discussed there.

**Note \#2:** If you are a law student or know a law student, there is a
competition around the legal difficulties of the J6 victims. It is an
essay contest. If you are interested, here is

site. Scroll down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Opposite Rule of Liberalism states that whatever the Left is saying
about its political opponents, assume the opposite and you will get
close to the truth. This should not be confused with contradiction. If
the Left says “X”, it does not follow that the literal opposite of “X”
is the truth. All this rule tells us is that what the Left is saying is
not the truth and that the truth is going to be completely different
from what they are saying, often the complete opposite.

The classic example of this is ten years ago when the Tea Party was a
thing. This purely grassroots movement in reaction to the radicalism of
the Obama administration was called “AstroTurf” by the Left. The Left
claimed their activism was organic while the Right was manufacturing
activism. The Tea Party was a creation of the Republican Party and their
corporate masters. The reality was the opposite. Left-wing activism was
controlled by the party and financed by corporate America.

The opposite rule can also work as a warning. In fact, this is the best
application of the rule as it helps prepare for left-wing shenanigans.
The way this works is that once you hear warnings from left-wing people
about some threat, you can assume they are planning it or they are
actively engaged in it. The last bit is the way to bet when the Left is
overly excited about the claim. In other words, they have a habit of
accusing their opponents of crimes the are committing.

A good example of this is when the neocons were organizing the police
state during the Bush years. The Bush people said these new weapons of
the state would only be used against Muslims. Most of them were probably
sincere about this. Neocons hate Arabs more than they hate Europeans.
The Left said these tools would be used against normal Americans. Of
course, as soon as the Left gained power they started using these tools
to spy on Americans.

This behavior of the Left, where they accuse their enemies of what they
are plotting or doing, is used by conservatives as proof of the Left’s
cynicism. For conservatives, hypocrisy is the most powerful abracadabra
word. Despite all the evidence, they are sure that uttering this word
will destroy their enemies. When the Left accuses their enemies of
something they are doing, the conservatives scream about hypocrisy,
believing is does something magical for them.

This never has the desired effect because being accused of hypocrisy
only works if you care about factual accuracy. For conservatives, being
factual correct is important, so they would rather lose than be accused
of contradiction. This is mostly why they lose every fight. They like
losing while being right. For the Left, advancing their goals is what
matters, so they can live with contradiction. For them, facts are just
another tool that can be used as a weapon against the opposition.

It also helps that left-wing politics attracts a specific type. Eric
Hoffer observed that people often join mass movements out of
self-loathing. They wish to swap their hated sense of self with the
identity of the group, which they view positively. This is almost always
true with left-wing politics. The people in it are looking for a form of
salvation, where they are saved from thinking about their hated sense of
self. Instead, they get to focus on an enemy they can enthusiastically
hate.

Of course, hating an enemy that has the qualities you hate about
yourself is pretty much the ideal enemy for this sort of person. Their
self-loathing is transformed into a virtue while they express their
hatred for qualities they fear they possess. Collectively, this
transforms the Left into a mob driven by what looks like moral
indignation and a desire to purge the world of corruption. This is what
makes a relatively small number of people into a powerful force in
American society.

This shameless ability to project onto others the sins of the Left has
been the primary reason the Left has denominated American politics. They
claim the moral high ground, accuse anyone that resists of doing
something bad and then they do that bad thing to the people they are
accusing. After all, they have created the justification for the bad
thing they are doing. Conservatives spent the last half century trying
to prove they are not the villains while the Left marched from triumph
to triumph.

The opposite rule has been so effective, in fact, that there is no
longer an effective opposition to the Left in America. Conservatism has
collapsed and the political divide in America is the Cloud People, who
populate and control the managerial class, and the Dirt People, who
suffer under the rule of the managerial class. The Cloud People now
accuse the Dirt People are various things, like the insurrection
business, which is used to justify heavy handed tactics against the Dirt
People.

This self-referential indignation that grows from self-loathing has
become a religion for the managerial class. In fact, it has helped them
become class aware. It is why they find bizarre things to impose on
society. They are in support of child molesters in the schools, for
example, because it gives them people to hate. Those normal parents
showing up to fight against groomers and bigots in the schools provide
the needed foil for the Left. Their religion demands a devil.

This bizarre religion that animates the ruling class is effective at
walling them off from society and preserving their position. It is why
any questioning of official policy is labeled one of the abracadabra
phases that mean “outsider.” Ask about food bills doubling and you are
spreading misinformation. Question the war in Ukraine and you are a
Putin shill. Notice that crime is rising at rates not seen since the
1970’s and you are a violent white supremacist.

This is where that opposite rule becomes so effective. The need to
accuse an outsider of the worst crimes the Left can imagine becomes a
justification for committing those crimes against the alleged enemy. It
is how America so quickly moved from defending the liberal order and
individual rights to celebrating corporate censorship and the
persecution of political prisoners. The bad guys get worse, so the means
to defeat them must get worse as well. This is the terror escalator.

This is a parasitic and corrosive ruling ethos. The sharp decline in the
quality of life for most Americans over the last generation is one
result. The collapse in social trust is another consequence. Like the
desperate person eating the seed corn, what we call liberal democracy is
consuming the social capital of society in order to fuel the
hate-machine that props up the managerial class. At some point, maybe
soon, they run out of things to burn and the system becomes unstable.
