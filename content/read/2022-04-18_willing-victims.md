**Note:** The regular
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-reality-gap/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. The subject is
related to the post here. There was no Sunday Thoughts due to Easter.
There is a post about what is happening with the conduct of the war for
those interested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Word has begun to trickle out of Ukrainian and Russian channels on-line
that the Zelensky government has ordered the remaining holdouts in the
city of Mariupol to fight to the last man. Many have surrendered but
there is a remnant that has refused to give into the reality of their
position. On Sunday, the Russians gave them one last chance to walk away
alive. The word from both sides of the information war is that the
Zelensky government instructed them to die with honor.

The Russians have been slow to take the necessary steps to clear this
part of the city of the remaining militants. One reason is pointless
slaughter is not something any professional military enjoys. The other
reason is they were hoping to minimize damage to the steel works. The
slow progress of the war has been due to the Russian desire to minimize
infrastructure damage. Given that the Russians will have to rebuild
these territories after the war, this makes sense.

The other reason is that the remaining group of fighters is composed of
elite Azov soldiers, including some high level leaders. It also has a
group of foreign mercenaries trained by NATO. The Russians say they have
detected seven European languages in the radio traffic. There is a
strong possibility there are high ranking NATO advisors in this group.
The Ukrainians have made several attempts to extract people from this
site, so the Russians would like that prize if possible.

This is one of those glimpses into the heart of the issue. The Ukrainian
government does not care at all about the Ukrainian people. These
nationalists, like the civilian population, are just low value pieces on
the board. The real issue is the long running proxy war against Russia.
Zelensky is just a cat’s paw for the neocons in Washington who are
running this war. They back him because he does what he is told and he
does what he is told because he will retire an extraordinarily rich man.

Of course, the nationalist who rushed to back the Zelensky regime now
find themselves supporting a craven lunatic. This is the trouble with
living in the world of abstractions and theoretical concepts. You can
easily find yourself on the same side as the people who want you dead.
That is where many nationalists now find themselves. They are backing
Ukraine against Russia, which means they are supporting the Global
America Empire, which would like to exterminate them.

This is part of the greater lesson of Ukraine. A sense of identity that
is built around old grievances or opposition to some externality usually
leads to disaster. The obvious lesson is Irish nationalism during The
Troubles. The IRA and Sinn Féin were defined entirely by their
opposition to Britain. That has led Irish nationalists to let Ireland be
consumed by the EU and globalism. The Irish are now free to important as
many Africans as can make it to their island.

You see the difference between positive and negative identity in the
reactions of Poland and Hungary. Polish identity is strongly linked to
hatred of Russians. Hungarian identity is about the uniqueness of the
Hungarian people. The Polish government is going overboard to support
Ukraine against Russia, while the Hungarians have chosen to stay out of
the fight. The result is Poland is being used as a flophouse and
launching pad by NATO, paying the cost for all of it.

The deadliest example is in Ukraine itself. If the people calling
themselves nationalists actually cared about the welfare of the
Ukrainian people, their history, language and culture, they would not be
acting this way. Their zeal for Russian blood is destroying the things
they claim to defend. Tens of thousand of Ukrainian men will die and
millions of Ukrainian people will be displaced because the so-called
nationalist care more about their hatreds than the Ukrainian people.

The example they should have followed was the Finns. At the start of the
Second World War the Finns found themselves invaded by the Soviets. The
Finns staged a heroic defense of their homeland in the Winter War.
Finnish leaders, however, actually cared about the survival of the
Finnish people so they struck a deal with the Soviets that cost them
land and some dignity. Finnish nationalists put their people before
abstract concepts and arrived at the proper decision.

This is the fundamental problem with modern nationalism. It is nothing
more than a bundle of hatreds and complaints tarted up with aspirational
language that has no practical application. This is why nationalist
parties in Europe do poorly. They are great on the high minded concepts
and critiques against globalism, but they are short on a practical
agenda that promotes a positive sense of identity. Note that Le Pen has
been buoyed by her focus on bread and butter issues in France.

It is why nationalists movements have done so poorly in America. The
critiques against global trade and open borders go back to the 1970’s
when the paleo-conservatives started making them. The fact that Pat
Buchanan was right about everything thirty years ago has made no
difference. Cheap consumer goods, on-demand degeneracy and powerful
pharmaceuticals are not much of a culture, but they beat the lack of a
positive alternative vision of life.

Of course, the main reason for this is nationalism has been defined by
the enemies of it and that definition has been accepted by the
nationalists. The negative identity is defined by what the enemy
opposes. Therefore, nationalism has been defined by the people who
oppose it, which means it is a cartoon version of the real thing. Until
nationalists start with a clean sheet of paper, put their enemies out of
their head and sort out what they offer, they will remain the willing
victims of their enemies.
