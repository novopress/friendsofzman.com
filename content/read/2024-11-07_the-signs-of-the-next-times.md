One of the weird things about how the American empire operates is that
there is a long waiting period between the presidential election and the
installation of the winner, if the winner is not the incumbent. In most
countries with elections, the transition happens within a week or two of
the election. In America, the new president has months to wait for his
turn at the wheel and the outgoing administration has months to do their
worst, often with the goal of hobbling the next president.

The latter was on full display after the 2016 election. The last months
of the Obama administration were used to set up the Russian collusion
hoax, along with other schemes to prevent a smooth transition. The Trump
administration was crippled right out of the gate, forced to go through
the absurd theater of a special counsel to investigate what everyone
knew was a political dirty trick. Between November and January, the fate
of the Trump administration was sealed.

That is something to keep in mind this time. Like 2016, the political
class was sure they had fended off the invisible army of orange Hitlers,
only to find that their blue wall had crumbled once again. Unlike 2016
there was no way for them to claim it was fraudulent or illegitimate,
since the results were conclusive. This may explain the relative quiet
this time compared to 2016. By the standards of presidential elections,
this was a trouncing in both the electoral college and popular vote.

It is possible that the energy has run out of crazy land. People want to
think the madness set in during the 2016 election, but it started way
back in 2000 when the people we call the left went nuts over the Florida
recount. It has been a steady decline into madness for over two decades.
That is a long time to sit in the pumpkin patch waiting for the
conspiracy theories to be proven true. Perhaps they got tired of waiting
and are making their way back to the fringes of sanity.

It is impossible to know, primarily because it is impossible for the
non-ideological to understand the mind of an ideologue. The former group
tends to the practical, while the latter tends to the fanciful. Most
people think half a loaf is better than no loaf, while the ideologues
look at such a compromise as a conspiracy against the tides of history
and a justification for violence. It is why normal people are always
surprised by how the ideologues react to events.

The best we can do is look for clues around the issues of the day.
Project Ukraine, for example, has been central to the usual suspects for
a decade. Trump is no fan of this project, and he is no fan of Ukraine.
People tend to forget that Ukraine was central to his first impeachment.
The <a href="https://x.com/BillKristol/status/1854255014899806432"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> responsible for Project
Ukraine are the main players in the anti-Trump stuff going back to 2016.
They are also something like a drug-resistant virus that never stops
trying to kill the host.

At the moment, what we are getting is the usual stuff from the usual
suspects laundered in regime media as news and analysis. This Wall
Street Journal <a href="https://archive.is/hZ4sY" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> tries to frame the Trump plan as a choice
between Russia surrendering or Russia giving Ukraine time to regroup and
restart the war after Trump. This is the same narrative they have been
shopping in one form or another for a year. In other words, the usual
suspects may not have a scheme ready for Trump 2.0.

Another place to look for clues is in the antiwhite subculture. They
have been weirdly muted for the past year. One reason is the backlash to
DEI that took down a few prominent people. These were financed by
members of the economic elite, which might mean money is drying up for
the antiwhite bigots. This
<a href="https://x.com/nhannahjones/status/1854168143947596250"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">tweet</a> from New York Times rage head
Ida Bae Wells reads like a resignation letter. In 2016 these bigots were
enraged by Trump winning, but this time they are despondent.

The antiwhite race rackets are worth billions, so there is no reason to
think their relative quiet this time is a sign that they are about to
fold up their tents and get jobs down at the local Home Depot. It is
worth noting that crying “white nationalism” has lost all its punch over
the last few years. In other words, their muted response could be part
of a longer downward trend or simply part of a regrouping. Like the
neocons, how these people respond over the next months will provide some
clues.

Another area to watch to get a sense of what is happening is the media.
Crazies like Rachel Maddow were slightly less nutty this time, but other
nodes on the media rage machine were strangely sober. Again, the
decisive victory this time might be the issue as there is no easy
bogeyman for them to blame. On the other hand, the Biden debate
performance and the aftermath may have broken whatever spell had kept
these people within the narrative.

It feels like a lifetime ago, but the night of the Trump – Biden debate,
it was clear that the chattering skulls were stunned to see that
desiccated husk of Joe Biden drooling on himself and staring into the
nothingness. It is possible that there was some sort of awakening among
some parts of the media. These people are sociopaths, so no one should
be optimistic, but how they react over the next months will provide some
clues as to what is happening behind the scenes.

There are plenty of other places to look, but the reason it feels like
there is an eerie calm over the battlefield is everyone expected the
orcs to keep fighting, despite the results of the election. Instead,
they have retreated over the hill and are murmuring amongst themselves.
The thing to accept is they never quit. They will be back, so the
question is in what form will they return? What path back to perfidy
will they take in the coming months to continue the fight?
