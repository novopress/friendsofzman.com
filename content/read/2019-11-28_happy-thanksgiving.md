Somewhere I lived, a radio station would put this song on loop all day
so their employees could be home with their families. Someone told me it
is a tradition in New England, but I don’t know if that is true. Maybe
more of a habit. I knew a guy who would put that station on and listen
to that song all day. He may have been the person who told me it was a
New England tradition, but it was long ago.

The first time I heard this song in full was on the way back to
Massachusetts from a trip south for some reason. I was driving through
Stockbridge and I came upon a cop, who had pulled over a car full of
libertarians. You could tell they were libertarians by their unpleasant
demeanor and the “John Galt” stickers on their AMC Pacer. The cop was
beating them with his flashlight along the side of the road.

I stopped and offered to help him beat the libertarians. He was more
than happy to let me join in on the fun. Before long others had stopped
and joined in on the beating of the libertarians. There’s really nothing
like the holiday season to bring out the best in people. It was one of
those times when you really understood the meaning of a holiday like
Thanksgiving. All of us have a reason to give thanks, even if it just
that we were never a libertarian or defective in some similar way.

Thank you to everyone who supports the effort. I truly appreciate it.
Thank you to those who participate in what is regarded as one of the
best comment sections on this side of the great divide. It is one of the
things I count as a blessing. Whenever I’m out in the real world talking
about this stuff, I’m always asked how I managed to create such a fun
and informative comment section. I hope everyone has a wonderful day in
whatever way in which you give thanks. Happy Thanksgiving everyone.
