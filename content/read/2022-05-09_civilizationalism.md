In the eastern part of the European continent, today is Victory Day,
which marks the surrender of the Nazis to the Soviet Union. The official
surrender was signed on May 8th, 1945, but it was already past midnight
in Moscow. It was the biggest public holiday in the old Soviet Union.
Now it is celebrated in most of the former republics, with parades and
public commemorations. Under Putin, the Moscow military parade was
brought back after a hiatus under Boris Yeltsin.

It is hard for Western people, especially Americans, to grasp why
Victory Day is so important to the people of the Russian Federation. The
events of the war, when remembered at all, are recalled for the purpose
of promoting current narratives rather than a sense of national pride.
Of course, the memory of the war in Europe is highly stylized and
fictionalized. For the people in the East, the war and the triumph over
the Nazis is an important part of their national identity.

America lost about 400,000 soldiers in the war. The Brits lost about the
same and the French lost close to 600,000. For narrative purposes, the
Axis powers are not allowed to talk about their dead. The Soviet Union
lost twenty million people. Countries like Poland, Hungary and the
Baltic states lost close to ten percent of their population as a result
of the Nazi invasion and then the Soviet invasion. This is why the war
still looms so large in the consciousness of those people.

The war is why the word “Nazi” resonates much more with the people of
eastern Europe than even the nuttiest social justice warrior in America.
In America, the cartoon version of the past turns villains like the
Nazis into hollow figures who represent whatever the current year
harpies fear about themselves. For eastern people, the word conjures
memories of an existential threat to their existence. The Great
Patriotic War, as the Russians call it, was a war for the survival of
their people.

This civilizational angst is what lies at the heart of the war in
Ukraine. The Russians see themselves fighting a war for the survival of
their civilization. Volunteers from all over the Russian Federation are
now fighting in the Ukraine because they see themselves at war with a
West that threatens their existence. Washington is not threatening
genocide, but something almost as bad, the erasure of their national
identity. The Chechens like being Chechen and they will die for it.

This civilizational sensibility is hard for Western people to grasp.
America, of course, has no real identity. It is a collection of economic
and political slogans that holds together a continent full of strangers.
Europe still has some vestiges of national identity, but that has been
anathematized by the ruling elite of the continent. Nationalism is now a
synonym for fascism. In its place is the concept of European which is
even less meaningful than American sloganeering.

Civilizationalism got the people of the East through the war, but it
also carried them through communism. Despite the homogenizing ethos of
Marxism-Leninism, the national character of the people of the Soviet
Union survived. It was this sense of self that has been the basis of
revival after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The same sensibility
that allowed the people of Eurasia to survive the Mongol invasions has
allowed them to survive the invasion of Wall Street bankers in the
1990’s.

Again, this is hard for Western people to fathom. Unlike communism,
liberal democracy has been highly effective at reoriented its victims to
see themselves in purely economic terms, shedding their cultural
identity. Western people are baffled as to why Russians would give up
drag queen story hour to seize the Donbas. Western planners even assumed
the people of the Russian Federation would rather have McDonalds than a
connection with their ancestors.

Washington’s war on Russia brings up two bits of irony. One is the
people of the East overcame communism only to find the alternative was
worse. The communists promised to steal your labor and the dignity that
arises from it. Liberal democracy promises to steal your soul and
replace it with consumerism. The communists built monuments to the
workers while the liberal democrats destroy the monuments to your
ancestors and replace them with planned developments.

The other bit of irony in all of this is that if the West is going to
survive it is going to need to embrace civilizationalism as well. The
promise of the EU was that it would unite the countries of the Europe
for the common good. The trouble is the elites embrace the cancer of
multiculturalism. That cancer will have to be removed and replaced with
a civilizational sensibility that respects the variations within the
culture, traditions and demographics of people with a common history.

This concept is not entirely alien to the West. Europe rallied to defend
Christendom against the Muslims. It was not nationalism that led
Sobieski to lead his men against the Turks at Battle of Khotyn. It was a
civilizational identity that saw the Turks as alien invaders who must be
repelled in order to preserve Western civilization. Into the last
century, there was an understanding among Western people that despite
their differences, there was a West and he had to be defended.

Perhaps the psychosis of liberal democracy will finally be beaten out of
the West in what is looking like another futile and pointless war of
choice. Despite the disparity in wealth, the Russians merely have to
continue to exist in order to win. For the West, liberal democracy
requires the unconditional surrender of Eurasian identity to the
homogenizing forces of Liberal democracy. History shows that this is
every bit as futile as the crusades against Islam.

The big difference between this civilizational war launched by the West
and the one launched against Islam is that the East matters. The West
has deep economic connections to the East. That means this war will have
real costs to the people of the West, in terms of living standards. It
is unlikely that the people will be willing to sacrifice the only
benefit of liberal democracy for an abstract war against a people who
they naturally see as civilizational allies.
