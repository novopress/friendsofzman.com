In the American political system, the president is the symbol of the
democratic process, the embodiment of the general will. With few
exceptions, he gains office by winning a majority of votes in what is
close to a national plebiscite. If the radicals get their way, it will
soon be a national plebiscite, as they hope to eliminate the electoral
college so that large urban states can dictate to the rest of the
nation.

The reward for winning the favor of the people is to be locked away in a
museum called the White House, surrounded by the most complex security
system on earth. The president is the most isolated man in the nation.
He experiences everything through intermediaries in the White House and
the Washington media. Everything he thinks he knows about the people
over whom he rules comes to him thirdhand.

Thirdhand may be generous. His staff lives in the same sort of isolation
as the president, without some of the high-tech security. They have
spent their lives in the system and have no firsthand knowledge of the
country. Many have lived so long in the biggest small town on
earth—Washington, D.C.—that they may as well be aliens. Even their
language is beginning to drift away from that of the rest of the
country.
