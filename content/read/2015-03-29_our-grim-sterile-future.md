<a href="http://maggiesfarm.anotherdotcom.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Maggie’s Farm</a> yesterday. What struck me was the
images. The future as imagined by our rulers is always the same. Lots of
glass and stainless steel. Everything is mechanized and intimidatingly
efficient. Most important, it looks better without people.

Imagine those white tile walls and floors marked up by the zig-zag
graffiti of the local street gang. Think about <a

people who imagine these things certainly don’t think about it because
in their imagined future, there’s no vibrancy. Everything is
monochromatic. It’s *Blade Runner* after all the bad people have finally
been removed from the gene pool.

That’s the thing about what has happened in these hotbeds of
gentrification. Social movements arise in response to some problem, real
or imagined. The systematic removal from sight of the unwanted by
liberal white people is quickly followed by the creating of living space
fit for their kind and not the other kind.

The weird fascination with white and stainless, I suspect, part of the
subtext of gentrification. There’s also the Potemkin recreations of the
glory days of urban life as imagined by modern Progressives. Central
Square in Cambridge Mass has be refitted to look like late 60’s Berkley,
the last time and place it was cool to be an urban white person.

As I said the other day, the ruling class is developing a language of
their own. They are also creating a new aesthetic. The NYC subways will
look like Logan’s Run, while the above ground shops will have an ersatz
bohemian grittiness. Looming over all of it will be the glass and steel
towers. Maybe that’s where they will mount the
