As you read <a
href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/05/26/officials-flpd-bso-attempting-to-control-unruly-crowd/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this story</a> or watch the
video, what’s on your mind? What is the question you have as the story
unfolds? What is not answered until you read the comments section? Most
likely, everyone reading it had the same questions and slowly started to
have the same answers. Even the the truest believers in multiculturalism
know the answers, even if it they try hard to suppress it.

Imagine if it was a gang of Hell’s Angels rioting at the beach. The copy
would have full descriptions of everyone involved along with scary
pictures of the bad guys. If a bunch of skinheads, assuming there’s
enough of them around anymore to create a ruckus, were fighting on the
streets their race and ideology would be front and center, probably in
the headline. That’s not the case here so we are left to wonder who they
were and what they looked like. Were they Chinese octogenarians?

Of course, everyone knows what’s going on here. That’s the way it is
these days. Large parts of reality are simply unmentionable. We live in
unreality-ville. That’s where we know things by their absence, in the
same way astrophysicists identify a black hole by examine the space
around it. That which can never been seen or pointed out is known by the
warping of objects around it. It is there, but not there, because no on
dare mention it, at least not in public.

What makes it laughable are the comments on every one of these stories.
It has become a game among the commoners to come up with the pithiest
way to fill in the missing parts. In fact, it is the the best part of
crime stories these days. What makes it even zanier is the PC fanatics
who run these sites don’t bother to police the comments section. Maybe
they have simply thrown in the towel or perhaps it is just another weird
angle to the unreality.
