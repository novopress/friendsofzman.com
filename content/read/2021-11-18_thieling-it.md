For a very long time, there was a zone of acceptable behavior in
politics that was bound by both political coalitions. One side of the
political class established the right side and the other camp
established the left side. Within those two boundaries is where you
found acceptable political discourse. If someone on the right side
started noticing things, they were thrown over the wall into the void.
Similarly, if someone called shenanigans on the liberals, they were
marginalized.

Most people noticed the barrier on the right side as it was the tallest.
Those gatekeepers also made a big deal out of being gatekeepers. In
retrospect, conservatism was nothing more than a gatekeeper’s handbook.
On the left side, the grandees did their policing more subtly, with a
sense of shame.  People like Bernie Sanders and Dennis Kucinich were
tolerated as long as they knew their place. They got to pretend to be
real socialists as long as they never threatened the established order.

The story of the last decade or so is the collapse of both walls. Donald
Trump swung a wrecking ball through Conservative Inc. What started as a
vanity campaign set off a populist rebellion first aimed at the
gatekeepers on conservatism. Forgotten in all of this is the way Trump
humiliated the Bush wing of the party. The mediocrities running
conservatism did the rest. The whole thing collapsed under the weight of
its own stupidity, corruption and perfidy.

Something similar occurred on the left side. The Bernie Sanders
challenge to Clinton in the 2016 campaign exposed a massive crack in
that foundation. His 2020 run forced Liberal Inc. to blow up it up to
prevent Sanders from winning. In retrospect, the 2020 shenanigans should
include the rigging of the Democratic primary. The result was a collapse
of the gatekeeping on that side. This is an underappreciated part of the
whole effort to install Joe Biden as president.

It seems that some of the empire’s rich people have noticed that the
walls are down, so they are coming up with solutions. One is a new
university in Texas that will gather up various exiles from the
establishment into something of a think tank. Their [stated
claim](https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/we-cant-wait-for-universities-to)
is they will challenge the orthodoxy of the academy. The money for this
is coming from a guy calling himself [Joe
Lonsdale](https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale). He is part of the Peter Thiel
network, so it is safe to assume that Thiel money is involved too.

When you look at the list of people involved, it is basically civic
nationalism gathering the remaining troops for one last stand. The
“left-wing” people involved are the old liberals who never embraced
cultural Marxism. The “right-wing” types are mostly people who never had
a chance to work at AEI or Heritage. The one thing all of these people
have in common is they are exiles from the establishment foundations.
This project is an effort to create their own version of Heritage.

The problem with challenging the established orthodoxly is you need to
do so from an alternative moral order. Civic nationalism has never had a
moral order at its center, so it was never much of a challenge to the
ideologues. This is stunningly clear now that cultural Marxism is off
its chain and running wild. What does Conservative Inc. say about the
corruption of the law we see in the Rittenhouse trial? Their advice is
you should throw your guns in the nearest lake and stay home.

Into this moral void is flowing the integralists. These are mostly
Catholic [revanchists](https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=25642) who think
the answer to the present is to rewind the clocks. They keep turning up
in the pages of the American Conservative.
[Here](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-i-joined-the-university-of-austins-advisory-board/)
is Sohrab Ahmari explaining why he has joined the new university.
[Here](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/in-defense-of-cultural-christianity/)
he is explaining their new moral order along with some fellow
revanchists, also involved in the new university project. Buchanan’s old
publication seems to be part of the new gatekeeper operation.

Interestingly, it appears that Rod Dreher has not got the memo about the
new direction of his platform.
[Here](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/caesarism-from-post-liberal-right/)
he is reacting to a post by Patrick Deneen, another Catholic revanchist,
lumping Dreher in with David French. It is an excellent observation as
both men are cafeteria Christians. They pick from the vast menu that is
Christianity to create for themselves a religion that suits their needs.
Dreher takes issue with it, but he should have read it as a warning. His
days are now numbered.

Another interesting fact is the Catholic revanchists are involved with
the Yoram Hazony project, which is also funded by Peter Thiel. We have
one oligarch and some lesser allies working to fund a new building
project. The new walls on the right will be built on a new brand of
nationalism, stripped of the icky parts, and a civic nationalism rooted
in a desire for the old throne and altar conservatism. It is a do-over
of sorts, starting someone in the middle of the last century.

Taken as a whole, the Theil project is an interesting play by one of the
most important and ambitious oligarchs. Unlike many of his fellow
oligarchs at the table, he seems to get that a storm is brewing. If they
wish to avoid the national razor, they better figure out how to create
order from the chaos. Unlike the other oligarchs, people like Bill Gates
or Mark Zuckerberg, Thiel is not trying to curry favor with the cultural
Marxists. He seems to get that they are the problem.

The trouble, of course, is that this is a rearguard action. In order to
rebuild those old walls, there has to be a ruling class consensus to
defend. That was always the point critics missed about Conservative Inc.
It was created as part of the ruling class consensus that formed up
after the Cold War. One reason it is in ruins is the consensus no longer
exists. Into that void is flowing the demographically driven identity
politics that so frightens the civic nationalists.

That is another thing missed by the civic nationalists. You see it in
that Deneen
[post](https://postliberalorder.substack.com/p/abandoning-defensive-crouch-conservatism?r=7xzwj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=)
about his new brand of conservatism. Defense of the liberal order, which
is the heart of civic nationalism, was itself a creation of the
post-Cold War consensus. Without that political center, civic
nationalism is nothing more than armed men defending a city that has
already been put to the torch by the radicals. The Rittenhouse story is
not just a young man on trial. It is civic nationalism on trial.

While it is wise to assume the worst from these new projects, the fact
that they exist should be read as good news. When the oligarchs are
sensing that things are heading into very dangerous waters, it means
they are ready to stop playing make believe and engage in serious
politics. Cultural Marxism poses a greater threat to them than it does
the common people. If the oligarchs start to question the prevailing
moral orthodoxy, it opens the door for a legitimate challenge.
