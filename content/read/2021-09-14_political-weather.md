Depending upon where you live, the news could be full of dire warnings
about how the virus is still raging and you must remain vigilant.
Alternatively, the news may be about how those heretics somewhere else
are being visited by an extra wave of the virus for mocking blessed
Covid. It did not take long for the panic to become a racket. The Covid
industrial complex is like a public works project. Everyone involved is
committed to one thing and that is never ending the job.

Of course, there is always time for a reminder that the secret invisible
army of Hitlers is out there in the shadows. Everyone needs to be on the
lookout for white supremacy and all its manifestations. Every once in a
while someone utters a discouraging word in the earshot of a minority,
so the local news team rushes into investigate. Sometimes the national
scandal monger chopper in a team to investigate something, which gives
the locals a reason to put on a show about it too.

Many people have dropped out of media consumption for this reason, but
they cannot escape the constant reminders that you better be afraid. It
is impossible to live in the modern world without being exposed to some
of it. The only means of escape is to unplug from all mass media,
including the internet. Even that is not enough, as your friends and
family will still be connected and some of them will be there to remind
you of the various things that are supposed to keep you up at night.

Short of doing a Ted Kaczynski and relocating to a cabin in the
wilderness, there is no escape from the reign of media terror. No
physical escape, at least. The thing is, few people want to remain in
this hyper-emotional state, so they find ways to filter it out and get
on with what matters in life. You see this with the Covid lunacy. It is
as if people are thinking, “okay if I wear this ridiculous mask around
in public, I can be left alone to do the things I need to do so I’ll
just wear the mask.”

Similarly, the latest vaccine mandate is being met with ignorance by
most people as they have checked out of the Covid drama. They simply
ignore the Covid news now, so they missed it. Employers will probably
ignore it as well, as the last thing they need right now is another way
to hassle their workforce. The bureaucracy could very well ignore
Biden’s orders as well, as they are permanent, while he is temporary.
This reality was made plain under Trump for four years.

One reason people are not in the streets demanding an end of this stuff
is they have found a better solution. They just ignore it. Look around
the dial over the weekend and you see that the sportsball arenas were
packed with fans. They were not wearing masks or social distancing. It
was like none of it had happened. You can be sure that television
ratings were back to the prior levels. As far as most Americans are
concerned, it is football season. Covid season is over.

The same can be said the bombardment of race in mass media. Spend a few
minutes watching one of those sportsball shows and you quickly see that
every ad is some version of hate whitey. Most people, of course, have
long ago developed the ability to not see ads of any kind. Even ads that
are attention getting, like the ones created for the Super Bowl, are
forgotten the next day. Humans in a mass culture develop a force field
to block out the things they dislike.

This is why the Soviet system staggered on for so long. The oppression
under Stalin was unsustainable, but Stalin died before than could be
tested. Instead, they got a decade of feverish experimentation under
Khrushchev. That failed and threatened the stability of the system, so
he was pushed out and what replaced him was a new normal in which most
people were left to live as best they could within the rules. People
ignored the craziness of communism so they could live.

In the current age, things move faster than in the prior age, so we may
be living in an accelerated version of this. In the Soviet Union the
joke was, “they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.” Perhaps the
new normal in America is “They pretend to rule over us and we pretend to
play along.” The rantings of the current old man in the White House
become background noise. People pretend to notice, but otherwise get on
with their lives and don’t make a fuss about it.

After all, much of what our political class seems to be doing of late is
best explained by an effort to get attention. Sandy Cortez showed up at
some swanky gala wearing a
[dress](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/maskless-aoc-attends-elite-50k-ticket-met-gala-tax-rich-dress)
with the slogan “tax the rich” on it. The only reason this horse-faced
barmaid is in Congress is she is good at getting attention. No one
really cares what she or any of these people have to say about anything.
The only reason to notice them is when they do something stupid like
this.

We may be in the phase of the Soviet system where the empire is now on
autopilot and the people in charge are just playing make believe.
Similarly, the people they are supposed to rule are playing along on the
surface but are going about their lives as best they can despite the
noise. Unless and until there is a genuine crisis, politics is just an
increasingly freakish carnival act. Since the pols are locked out of the
cockpit, they are left to gain our attention by other means.

What we may be at the tail end of is a holiday from reality. Since none
of these crises ever amounts to much, people pay attention if they need
to feel some excitement, but otherwise tune it out and just live as
consumers. There are minor ups and downs, but nothing important really
happens, so no one feels the need to be too worked up for too long about
anything. Like the weather, if you don’t like what is happening, just
wait and things will change on their own.
