politics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The boom-bust economic cycle that came with the industrial age has been
a primary focus of economics for close to two centuries. Marx was the
first to notice that these periodic economic crises were an inherent
part of the system. He theorized that over-production was the cause,
which lead to a destruction of capital. The economist Joseph Schumpeter
picked up on this and gave us the term “creative destruction” to frame
the busts as corrections to inefficiencies.

It is one of those truths that still haunt the modern economy. The
reason the down cycle is terrifying is that economics is really about
politics. When the busts come, the people get angry at the politicians.
Worse yet, they can get angry at the rich people and start demanding a
share of the loot. It’s why economics has evolved to prevent the bust at
any cost. Seven trillion in new money was created over the last year in
response to the Covid panic in order to keep people pacified.

We still have the boom-bust issue, just in small scale. A new idea goes
through a familiar cycle. At first it is highly profitable for the
owner. They ramp up their production to meet demand. Soon, others come
up with similar products that cut into his market, thus undermining his
profits. In time the profits are reduced to the barest minimum as the
product becomes a commodity. In time the value to the original creator
of the new product drops to zero. It is a commodity.

This is generally considered a good thing by modern economics, as it
means the relative cost of goods continues to fall. It also means
intellectual capital is naturally forced to innovate. The company with
the hot new product knows they will have to keep coming up with hot new
ideas. Otherwise, their profits will fall. On the other hand, they might
seek a monopoly like we see with the tech oligarchs, which allows them
to artificially maintain their profit margin.

There is another angle to this that is unique to this age. The
technological revolution has created a new form of capitalism that is
rooted in the creation of new ideas, particularly in the entertainment
space. Like the imitators who draft on the creations of the innovators,
this new process in the technological economy is dependent on the
initial creative energy of an innovator. Unlike the old industrial age
imitator, this new form of economic activity is highly profitable.

It works like this. The new idea for something like a movie or a type of
popular music is expensive and difficult to create. It requires smart
and creative people to try different things until they get a concept
that works. Then they have to convince investors or an audience, often
both, to give it a look. In the case of a movie, it means the risk of a
box office bust. In the case of music, it means years of failure, while
living on cat food. The new idea promises profit, but mostly risk.

If the new thing does well, then this is where the new entrepreneur
steps into the picture and realizes the big profit. That hit movie
becomes a franchise. Soon, there is a remake which is very profitable.
Then subsequent remakes, reboots and spin-offs that have declining
profits. Eventually, they reached a point where there is no profit in
the franchise. At this point, the original concept has lost its value
and often has a negative value, due to the terrible imitations that came
after it.

Recent examples of this in Hollywood are legion. The Terminator
franchise has become a joke due to the many sequels. So desperate to
squeeze the final pennies from the idea, they have the 70-year-old
Arnold Schwarzenegger playing a geriatric robot named Carl who is an
interior decorator. The Alien franchise is mostly known for the idiotic
reboots and spin-offs that are easily mocked. These are two ideas
drained of all value, like the corpse after a vampire has drained the
blood.

This happens with other things like pithy phrases. Back in the Obama
years, someone used the term “crony-capitalism” to describe the
tightening bonds between global corporations and the government. The
phrase caught on and was in the mouth of every right-wing pundit. In
time it sounded like some of them had a form of Tourette’s, in which
they burped out that phrase uncontrollably. Today we have “deep state”
and “globalist” getting the same treatment from the same crowd.

The thing is, these vampires who prey on new ideas are not without
talent. They have a useful set of skills, in that they are able to drain
every last drop of value from an intellectual property. They do so
without regard to their own reputations or the reputation of the
original creator. They are proud to be vampires and they are handsomely
rewarded for their skill. In fact, they do better than the originators,
who are often looking for the next concept or ignored by the imitators.

This is not confined to entertainment. A new bit of software can expect
the same treatment, as most of Silicon Valley is now tuned to rapidly
replicate and consume every new idea that comes along. The cable chat
shows are festooned with ads for “apps” that are copies of some
original. Facebook, in fact, is just a cheap knock-off of an original
idea lost to the mists of time. It now is being cloned and copied by
those looking to find some remaining profit from the idea.

A few years ago, an “entrepreneur” came up with the scheme to convince
people that buying shaving products was difficult. Instead you should
subscribe to a mail order service for razors. There was no new product
or an effort to change the demand for razors and shaving products. The
whole scheme was about fooling people into thinking there was a razor
conspiracy. The goal was to get them to expose their neck so the
vampires could get a clear shot at the artery.

Of course, this “innovation” has come in for the same treatment. The
airwaves are full of ads claiming there is an underwear conspiracy that
can only be solved by bespoke undergarments from a boutique maker.
Instead of coming up with a better mousetrap, genius is finding a way to
trick people into paying for the same mousetrap. Once the blood has been
drained from that deception, it will be onto some new scheme to provide
less for more, under the guise of innovation.

This has created a world that selects for the type of person able to
suck every last drop of blood from a new idea. In a world where you make
as much or more money from copying the ideas of others, it makes sense
that people will go into that line of work, rather than the creative
end. Hollywood is now full of vampires, looking to drain the blood from
the next new idea. There are no “new ideas” in the movie world, because
there is no one there interested in being sucked dry by his fellow
vampires.

If these selection pressures exist long enough and are widespread
enough, then eventually you have a world of too many vampires and too
few victims. Those vampires have to feed, so they will move onto other
victims. That may be where we are now in the late stages of empire.
Everywhere you look the remaining bits of the original spirit are
covered with vampires, looking for a clear bit of neck into which they
can sink their fangs and suck some blood. Ours is a vampire economy now.
