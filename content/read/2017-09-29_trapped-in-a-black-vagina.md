week I give over the entire podcast to reading the Epic of Gilgamesh in
its original ancient language, Akkadian. I’m kidding, of course, but you
can <a
href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/10/hear-the-epic-of-gilgamesh-read-in-the-original-akkadian-language.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">listen that</a> if you are interested. I
listened to a few minutes of it and it was interesting, but I don’t
think hip-hop performers will be sampling anything from it.

This week I have the usual variety of items. I’ll tried posting a bonus
track on Gab this week, but their video system is bleeped up and I don’t
know when it will be fixed. If you are not on Gab, you should be,
despite their flaws. They are the good guys fighting to keep the lamps
from going out in the West.

For this week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has only segments
from the show as they are now censoring me. Every effort to post the
full show was rejected without much of an explanation, so I just posted
some clips. Sorry. I think this is the last week of YouTube. The service
sucks and the company is evil. I am now on iTunes, which means the Apple
Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones.
