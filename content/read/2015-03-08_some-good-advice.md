A a general rule, if the first result on Google for your name is a link
to mugshots.com, you have made some bad decisions. Of course, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">frivolous ninnies like Alex Tabarrok</a>
blame it on excessive parking violations, but there’s a reason no one,
including a university, lets guys like Alex Tabarrok have any
responsibilities. To paraphrase a commenter there, libertarian
chatterboxes can afford the luxury of maintaining an adolescent
worldview well into adult life.

For those of us in the real world, a good rule of thumb is to avoid
spending time around guys with names like Dreekius Oricko Johnson. His
mother would have done better by him if she named him Food Stamp or
Government Cheese. At least then he could pass himself off as the child
of dope smoking artists. instead he came into this world with a ghetto
name and left this life in a ghetto fashion.
