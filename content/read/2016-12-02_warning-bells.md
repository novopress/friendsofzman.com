What has been happening in the West for the last decade, or so, is a
populist reaction to the rise of global technocracy. Globalism is the
spiritual-economic model that rewards poor people in poor countries and
rich people in rich countries. The rich people in poor countries get a
boost, as well, but that is a happy accident. The rich people in rich
countries, pushing free trade and open borders, get their spiritual
boost from seeing poor strangers rise up to challenge the middle classes
in Western countries.

Global technocracy is the administrative off-shoot, where the attendants
of the ruling elites take up newly created positions in the growing
international administrative bodies. This includes Western universities,
which have been deliberately transformed into international
indoctrination and propaganda centers. In 1970, for example, Boston
University was a commuter school for middle class kids in Massachusetts.
Today the student body is close to
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/isso/about/statistics/student-15/"
target="_blank">50% foreign born</a>. Nowhere is the New Religion more
popular than the college campus.

Popular resistance to this new form of governance is striking fear in
the hearts of the ruling class, mostly because the people in charge have
come to believe their own rhetoric about the arc of history. The people
in charge of the EU just assumed everyone wanted the amorphous, gray
blob that is Europe, rather than the vibrant national heritage that is
their patrimony. Resistance to turning large swaths of Europe into
Muslim ghettos has come as a bit of shock to the people in charge. Why
wouldn’t people want this?

That fear will eventually be replaced with a response and that response
will not be a change of heart. As we see in Europe, the people in charge
have no limits when it comes to inflicting harm on their own people, as
long as it supports the European project. Angela Merkel invited in a
million Muslims, that no one wanted, because she hoped it would weaken
the strength of Germany’s native population. Obama opened the flood
gates with a similar goal in mind, but he was just a bit too late to
stop Trump.

Anyway, that’s my reaction to <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html"
target="_blank">this column in the New York Times</a>. It reads like a
planning session, by managerial class types, about how to de-legitimize
the resistance.

You’ll note that there is nothing in there about the conduct of the
ruling class. If whatever they are calling “democracy” at the moment
produces degenerates like the Clinton Crime Family or easily manipulated
airheads like Bush or Obama, people are going to get suspicious of
whatever you’re calling democracy. Of course, the fact that democracy,
strictly speaking, is just mob rule, is not addressed. According to our
betters, the Founders were a bunch of Nazis, because they opposed
democracy.

The big point is the last one. Any resistance to the status quo will now
be classified as anti-democratic. This is, of course, a backdoor way of
smearing anyone who questions the wisdom of allowing unaccountable
bureaucrats free rein to rearrange the social order, based on theories
popular only on the college campus. It is a lot easier to call
critics immoral and beyond the pale, than it is to debate them, so there
will now be a healthy market for intellectuals, who can demonize the
resistance to the status quo.

The humorous part of the story is this bit.

For the last decade or so, it was popular on the Official Right to use
Venezuela as a club to beat their liberal buddies over the head. Now
those liberal buddies, having lost an election, are using it to beat
their “conservative” buddies over the head. What’s funny about it is
that the people who voted for Trump did so as a rejection of the
Official Right, as much as a rejection of the Left. The Punch and Judy
Show among defenders of the managerial class has lost its audience.

The fact is, democracy is a disaster. It’s a free shot for despots and
lunatics to gain power, at which point they put an end to democracy.
Democracy is a bus that runs in one direction and only has one
destination – authoritarianism. It’s why sensible men of the Right,
notice the qualifier, have preferred ordered liberty in the form of
representative self-government. It permits the state to be responsible
to popular will, but it protects the citizens from themselves and their
worst instincts.
