Complexity in human systems often results in properties that have no
obvious relationship to the people in the system. The example used when
trying to explain complexity is the ant colony. A single ant is not a
terribly complicated thing, but the ant colony is highly complex.
Further, the actions of a single ant appear to be random, but all of
those ants together look like a highly coordinated effort. You cannot
learn much about an ant colony by studying a single ant.

Complexity in human systems often results in a disconnect between the
user inputs and expected outputs. People who work with large software
systems run into this when making changes to the system. If the system
has been around for a while, it often has been modified many times by
many hands. New changes often result in strange and unexpected
downstream consequences. Every new change means the next change will be
more costly in testing and error correction.

Ants and software can be interesting, but they are not the best example
to use when thinking about the human system known as society. We don’t
have the ability to completely stand outside of society, like we do with
an ant colony, and objectively observe the emergent properties as a
whole. We live in society. Unlike a software system, we don’t have a
design spec or documentation. We have to infer the design from the
actions we observe, which creates its own complexity.

We have some examples of this over the last year. The great election
fraud was not the result of a master plan from grand strategists
operating in a secret lair. Like the ant colony, it was the result of
thousands of individual actions by people motivated by years of
conditioning from the ruling class. For the bulk of the managerial
class, down to the entry level clerks, opposing Trump became a religion.
Stopping him through any means necessary became part of their collective
mindset.

The weird cultural revolution being imposed on the military offers an
example in the present to see how this works. The military is a vast,
complex machine. Most of what it does is enable a relatively small
number of people to wage war. It is a rule based, male dominated system.
It is being turned into a chaotic, feminine system. As thousands of men
flee that system, the system will change in ways no one can predict.
Whatever it becomes, it will not be the world’s most powerful military.

Another example that is still playing out is the Covid panic. Over the
last year the main thread of the story has been the political class
trying to contend with the unintended consequences of their actions. The
reason their story keeps changing is their inputs never have the desired
outputs. They have to keep going back and rewriting the story of their
actions to fit the present reality. It turns out that throwing wrenches
into the gears of human society was not the smartest play on their part.

The big new stimulus bill to try and patch up what they have wrecked is
another example of system complexity. The final cost of this relief bill
is about $15,000 per household or $6,000 per person. Obviously, everyone
is not getting a check for those amounts or anything close to it. Most
of the money is going to the kleptocrats who run the uniparty system.
People who made less than $75,000 will get a check for $1,400 per person
in the household, with some exceptions.

The hope is the money will be spent as soon as it gets into the hands of
the people, but that is not a guarantee. That’s not how the first round
of checks played out. People used the money to pay down debts. Over the
last year, a strange new behavior has emerged with the American people.
They are paying down debts and saving money. Instead of rushing out to
buy toys with those checks, they paid off bills. There has also been a
wave of debt consolidation exploiting artificially low interest rates.

There is a good chance the new round of checks accelerates this trend
away from consumerism toward saving. While the propaganda machines are
telling the people to spend the free money, the people are hearing
concern. The rulers would not be handing out cash if things were solid.
They must be very worried about things they are not mentioning in
public, so people are preparing for the worst. This is a good example of
how complex human system are difficult to manipulate.

There’s also the fact that the rulers radically altered, without any
obvious reasons, the habits and customs of society. All of a sudden, we
have these new religions requiring people to wear codpieces on their
faces and go through struggle sessions over zoom about their privilege.
People working from home are not the same people who used to gather
around the water cooler or have a drink together after work. This big
complex system is suddenly very different. The old rules no longer
apply.

This is what makes the revolution imposed from above so dangerous. The
people who initiated these changes in American society are not working
from a grand plan or a set of ideological goals. There is no point to
what they are doing. Instead, our managerial revolutionaries are swept
up in forces they do not understand. It is a strange, recursive and
reactionary revolution from the top. The best they can muster for an
explanation is, “we’ll know where we are going when we get there.”

Just as no one can know what will happen with the latest round of
stimulus, no one can know what will happen as a result of the “great
reset.” The millions flooding over the border suggests some form of
collapse is in the future. Complex systems, however, tend not to
collapse. They seize up in one area and the system responds to that
failure, which triggers new unexpected failures elsewhere in the system.
The result is an increasing level of chaos within the system.

What most likely lies ahead is spasms of disorder, followed by
increasingly ham-fisted efforts to impose order. Those efforts to set
things right will set off new spasms of disorder elsewhere in the
system. The razor wire barricades in Washington are a good example of
how this will work. The solution to the problem they created is going to
set off a bunch of new problems. The main feature of this age will be
men racing from one station to the next, trying to keep the plates
spinning.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
