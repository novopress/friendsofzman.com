I was a little stumped on what to do with the show this week, so I
figured something on current events might work. My day job keeps me busy
this time of year, so I am pressed for time. A “review of and comment
upon the news” type of show is easy to put together compared to some of
the other stuff I like to do. I just need to find a handful of news
items that are interesting to me. The show writes itself. I have not
been following the news much lately, so it meant scanning the main news
sites.

I’ve made this point about cutting the cord, but it applies to following
current events as well. When you step away from this stuff for a while,
coming back feels like you are entering a strange new world. Like
Hollywood, the people engaged in politics have always been weird and
alien. When you see it every day it is a familiar weirdness that you
just accept. Go away for a while then come back to it and you see that
our ruling class is foreign and deranged.

A great example of the strangeness is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePwpKYDi-h8&amp;feature=youtu.be"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video</a> from yesterday.
I first saw it on Tucker after I put the show together. My goodness.
Look at those eyes. That’s the result of lots of pills washed down by
lots of chardonnay. If that face popped out of the darkness, you would
die of fright. Then there are the facial tics. I kept waiting for smoke
to start coming out of her and then her face to fall off. Those ticks
reminded me of
<a href="https://youtu.be/9v-33jcEDk4?t=30" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this scene</a> from the old Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

The thing that keeps coming to my mind is that there was a meeting in
Pelosi’s office discussing this ridiculous stunt. The heads of the mass
media operations, her staff and assorted party operatives all decided
that was a good plan. Sending that dilapidated old bag out to slur
through that speech was their plan. Maybe they are stuck with her, but
who in their right mind would sign off on that speech? The greatest
thespian on earth could not perform those lines without making the
audience wince.

Speaking of Tucker Carlson, he did a segment last night on <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-purdue-pharma-media-playbook-how-it-planted-the-opioid-anti-story"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this story</a> about
Conservative Inc. taking bribes to peddle opioids. The story itself is
shocking for its cravenness, even to cynics on our side of the great
divide. American Enterprise was trying to kill white people, for just a
few grand a year from Purdue Pharma. It really goes to the heart of
things. These freaks and weirdos ruling over us hate us. They hate us so
much they will partner with a mass murderer to poison us.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
