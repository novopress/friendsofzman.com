Despite their many parallels in practice, we separate ideology from
religion as two separate things that appeal to different aspect of man.
Ideology is an integrated set of assertions, theories, and goals for
achieving a social end, while religion is assumed to be a set of beliefs
with a supernatural basis. The ideologue is focused on imposing changes
in how we live as humans in a human society, while the believer is
someone primarily focused on how the individual reaches the afterlife.

This distinction is entirely due to Christianity, which is a universal
set of beliefs that apply to all individuals, even those unaware of it.
Christians start with the belief that all people have an individual
relationship with God. The point of life is to discover and embrace this
relationship so that you can sit at the feet of God in the afterlife. As
a result, we think of religion as a world-rejecting phenomenon. It is
focused on what comes after this life, not how to improve this life.

This has not always been how religion works. What we used to call
paganism was not particularly concerned with the afterlife. The
religions of pre-Christian people were often world-affirming and
specific to their people. A people had their gods to whom they could
appeal for practical things like a good harvest or protection from the
bad people on the other side of the valley. Their gods were tied to
their identity as a people and their customs that gave meaning to their
lives.

Some of the old religion still exists in this age. You cannot become a
Druze, for example, even if you learn their religion. You have to be
born into their faith in order to be accepted into their religion.
Shintoism is not as strict, in terms of outsiders joining the religion,
but for all practical purposes it is a Japanese faith. It is impossible
to disentangle Shinto belief from Japanese identity. These are what
people who study religion call folk religions.

Here is where you see the lines between religion and ideology blur.
While Marxism does not possess a god or gods, it is not without its
mystery. Marxist historiography is a central tenet of Marxism that must
be accepted without proof. Then you have the assertion that this arc of
history must bend toward communism. Of course, there is the assumption
that all of mankind will eventually progress to the point where they
join the rest of humanity in the communist paradise.

The similarities between religion and ideology have been noted many
times, but always as a way to underscore the irrationality of the
ideologue. The climate change people are compared to a cult, because
they carry on as if they are worshipping Mother Earth and fear she is
unhappy with mankind. Calling it a religion is a way to dismiss their
claims to science and reason. Joe Sobran made the comparison between the
Left and religion in his essay about [the
hive](http://www.sobran.com/hive/).

There may be another way of using this comparison. For example, the
distinction made between universal religions like Christianity and folk
religions like Shintoism provide an insight into why one triumphed over
the other with some exceptions. Christianity pushed out paganism in
Europe because it offered something that paganism either did not offer
or did not address as well as the new religion. Similarly, Christianity
has been a failure in Japan because it lacks something the native
religion possesses.

A simple example is the Gaia worshippers. What is it about this doomsday
cult that the believers find appealing? There is a money racket to it,
for sure, but this is only possible because millions of people sense
that the way we are living in the modern age is leading to some sort of
supernatural doom. Is this belief appealing because it offers salvation
from this world or is the appeal that it provides them with something to
supplement their identity as a group?

If we take that last part a bit further and incorporate Gaia worship
into the basket of things we call the Left, the result is a collection
of beliefs that define a group of people and give them an elevated sense
of status. Proof of their uniqueness is their membership in a group that
holds these beliefs. They are on the right side of history because they
carry their groceries in grimy canvas sacks and take their young
children to drag shows at the local library.

Perhaps the appeal of what we call wokeness lies in the sense of
identity it provides to people who live in highly conformist societies.
The people who embrace these ideas are uniformly white, educated and
upper-middle-class. They live in inorganic sterile suburban developments
and work in fields with high levels of enforced conformity, like
education, government, and corporate management. The folk nature of the
new religion is what helps give their lives meaning.

On the other hand, it is possible that the new religion is the vestigial
part of the old world-rejecting religion expressing through social fads.
The gender stuff is a clear rejection of biological reality. Gaia
worship is the rejection of human progress and civilization itself. The
thread that runs through all of these social fads is their
destructiveness to Western societies. The new religion of wrecking
things appeals to people seeking an escape from this life.

The other appeal is that the destruction of the old order and the coming
of the new world orders is full of uncertainty. The weirdness of these
beliefs operates as a selection mechanism, filtering out anyone who
questions the project. The new religion selects for those seeking the
same shelter from the storm, but also those who think that when the
storm passes, they will lead the way into the next phase of humanity.
There is, after all, a whiff of Calvinism to all of this.

At this point, it is hard to know where the new religion will go or
where it will end up on the folk-universal spectrum. What we can know is
that new religions are like new ideologies in that they appeal to those
unhappy with the present. Communism appealed to disaffected
intellectuals and the urban industrial poor. Christianity appealed to
provincials in the failing Roman empire. The reason this new religion
appeals to the managerial class is they are unhappy with the present.
