You go out for a long weekend and <a

plumpers</a>.

*A comedian under the impression he had rented out his posh Chelsea pad
to a man with family in town for a wedding returned home to a wild orgy,
he said.*

*Ari Teman, 31, claimed he left his apartment keys with David Carter,
32, on Friday night and stepped out for dinner before leaving town.*

*When he returned to the building to grab his luggage, a rowdy sex party
featuring “Big Beautiful Women” was in the process of being shut down by
building management.*

*“This was just so bizarre,” said Teman, who had rented his apartment
via the Web site Airbnb.*  
*“The worst part of the Internet right there was in my apartment.”*

*“There were all sorts of people walking out of my apartment and people
coming in from the back yard. It was a huge mess.”*

*Teman said his apartment was trashed by a group of nearly nude,
overweight people. After the shindig was broken up, Carter was a nervous
wreck in the lobby, Teman says.*

*“This guy had a look of horror on his face,” Teman said. “He didn’t
expect to see me for a few days. He said, ‘They shut us down, man,
they’re shutting it down.’ ”*

*Carter, however, claims he just had a small, quiet get-together and
that Teman was overreacting.*

*“I had six people, friends and family,” Carter told The Post. “He is
making a big to-do because he is being evicted.”*

*Carter posted on Airbnb that he wanted a place for his in-laws to stay
while they were in town for a wedding, Teman claims.*

*“He had a verified account and he seemed legit,” Teman said. “He had
three positive reviews and so I approved the deal.”*

*When Teman later searched Carter’s phone number on the Internet, he
found the raunchy soiree involving plus-sized women advertised online as
“Turn Up Part 2: The Pantie Raid.”*

*One person even blasted out Teman’s Seventh Avenue address in a tweet
for an “XXX FREAK FEST.”*

*Carter denied he had anything to do with the ad.*

*A web ad that was displaying information on the alleged orgy.*

*“There was no address on the advertisement and I had nothing to with
it,” he said.*

*The professional comedian called police, but no charges were filed. He
now claims he wants to move.*

*“I just don’t want to touch anything in there,” he said. “I threw
sheets all over everything.”*

*Carter claimed that a little partying never hurt anyone.*

One of the reasons to be skeptical of economists is right here in the
story. People are liars and unreliable. Economics has as an axiom that
in the aggregate, people are honest. Simple observation and 5,000 years
of history says otherwise. It is similar to the complaint about
crowd-sourcing. You see it in the story. One person is dumb and foolish,
but we’re supposed to believe that a million morons are smart and wise,
just by the magic of numbers. Similarly, a million liars is not making
for an honest market.
