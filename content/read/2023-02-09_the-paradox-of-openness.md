At the core of the American cultural outlook is the assumption that the
more open something is, the better it will become over time. Openness
means a low barrier of entry and a low of barrier entry means lots of
people with a wide variety of ideas can enter the system, thus improving
the system through competition. Therefore, the more open a system is to
new people and ideas, the faster it will mutate and improve into
something better than the original.

As much as conservatives like to label the cultural lunacy we see
happening as the product of Marxism, it really is the product of
Americanism. Sure, the people who brought us novelties like gender and
racial grievance were trained up in radical philosophy, but they have
always operated under the assumption that reducing the barriers to entry
is a primary goal. In fact, their presence in the academy is the result
of this bedrock belief in total openness.

Whether it is the marketplace of ideas or the marketplace of goods and
services, the starting American assumption is the more the better. If
you want better health care, so the argument goes, you need more
competition among providers. Get more providers competing for patient
dollars and inevitably the quality of  service will improve and the cost
to the patient will decline. Similarly, open the marketplace of ideas
and the number and quality of competing ideas will improve.

George Soros is now a stock villain in normie politics, but look at what
he calls his umbrella organization. It is the Open Society. George Soros
literally seeks the end of all borders in the world. That is not just
national borders, but all of the cultural and social borders that define
human society. In many respects, Soros is the extreme representation of
the core American principle of openness. He imagines the world as one
giant wide open frontier.

Of course, the frontier is why Americans love openness. The founding of
the American way of life was based on the idea that you could always
head west and find a new place to call home if you were not happy. This
later transformed into the natural mobility Americans take for granted.
The typical European lives his life in one place, only leaving for
holiday trips. Americans move all over the place, often from one type of
community to another, without thinking much about it.

You cannot move from Boston Massachusetts to Nashville Tennessee if the
people in these areas are naturally hostile to strangers. The typical
person from Tennessee may think the typical person from Massachusetts is
a mean word, but both people assume it is immoral to exclude someone
based on their place of origin. We will never see a campaign by one
region to block the migration of people from another region, even when
it is terrible for the receiving end.

We have a good example in Idaho. People are fleeing California due to
the economy, crime, taxes and general lunacy. They first moved to
Colorado where they promptly started voting for politicians that promise
to ruin Colorado. Now people are leaving the state because it is getting
as bad as California. The people of Idaho know this and should erect
barriers to entry in order to protect themselves from California, but
they would rather die than be rude to the newcomers.

American openness is the heart of the immigration problem. You can get a
majority behind enforcing the laws against migrants flowing freely over
the border, but you cannot get majority support for an end to all
immigration. The idea of closing a border brings shame and guilt to the
mind of the typical American. He cannot explain why he thinks closing
the border is wrong, he just knows it. Like the Idahoans, Americans
would rather die than be mean to newcomers.

In fairness, American openness was a great advantage. The openness to
new ideas and new people turned an empty continent into a superpower. It
made it possible to flood the continent and make the most of the natural
resources. If Americans were not willing to pick up and move, the West
would never have been conquered. Much of the technological progress the
world enjoys is the result of openminded sorts coming to America and
challenging old assumptions.

When the continent was protected by two massive oceans that were not
easy to cross, this ethic of openness was a great asset. Now that the
world is much more crowded and oceans are no longer a barrier, openness
is a liability. Not only are millions of people flowing into the country
ever month, every stupid and toxic idea is free to jump on stage and do
its worst. American openness is turning the country into the dayroom of
a lunatic asylum with no way to close the doors.

Many blame the problems of the West on individualism, but the more
serious problem may be American openness. Since the middle of the last
century, American values have been imposed on Europe. They now sound
like grievance studies professors because of the American cultural
dominance. For three generations, the ticket up the status ladder has
had the stars and stripes on it. As a result, openness is now as much a
European principle as an American one.

In the West, it is now immoral to close the door on anyone or anything,
with the exception of those who want to close the door. The surest way
to be removed from polite company is to question the open door policy.
Only fascists and white supremacist want barriers to entry and objective
standards. Paradoxically, the most tolerant and open culture in human
history is violently intolerant of anyone suggesting that there must be
a limit to tolerance and openness.

Fitness applies to all things, even morals and ideas. It is looking like
the open society, like many species, was able to flourish in an
exceptional environment, but once the environment returned to the norm,
the open society is no longer fit. Like the giant panda, the open
society is only suited for specific conditions. Unlike the giant panda,
there will be no zookeepers to maintain it. Either openness is abandoned
or it dies out taking the people with it.
