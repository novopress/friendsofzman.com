For as long as anyone has been alive, whatever we have defined as the
Left in America has always come with a healthy dose of hypocrisy. They
have one set of rules for themselves and their allies and an entirely
different set of rules, often the opposite set of rules, for their
opponents. The cry of hypocrisy from their opponents are met with
accusation about bad faith or dishonestly. The Left in America, since
the middle of the last century, has been defined by partisanship.

This is another aspect of the crisis in Canada that tells us something
about what is happening in the managerial elite. The Right has been
largely silent on what is happening and the outlandish hypocrisy on
display. Look through the few posts in Conservative Inc. about the
crisis over the last month and you do not see their favorite catch
phrase at all. The main takeaway is that the so-called conservatives are
mostly on the side of the government in this matter.

This is not just an American phenomenon. In Canada, the people who
supposedly speak for the conservative voters have been struggling to
produce a reason to oppose Trudeau’s power grab. You get the impression
they are ashamed to be lumped in with those dirty truckers. The is true
all over the English-speaking world. The Brits, who should take a
special interest in Canada, have been giving the crisis a good leaving
alone, while focusing on Ukraine.

What we see happening in Canada is the normalization of the double
standard that has always been a feature of left-wing politics. On
multiple occasions Trudeau has said that certain types of protests are
permitted. The grounds for determining this is who is protesting whom.
BLM protesting, for example, is always acceptable, because they exist to
fight the white power structure. An Antifa riot over the behavior of the
police is acceptable, as long as they wear their masks.

What we just witnessed in Canada is more than the implementation of this
stated policy but the formalization of it. The point of making this a
permanent emergency, which is what they are doing, is to make permanent
this new double standard for political participation in Canada. A Sikh
truck driver honking his horn to protest vaccine mandates is not allowed
because white supremacy. A Sikh truck driver plowing through a group of
white kids, because white supremacy, is okay.

Of course, this is not some out of left field manifestation in Canada,
but a continuation of a process that started in 2016. The people
protesting Trump were allowed to assault people and damage property. The
thousands of rioters who set fires and smashed windows during his
inauguration were never charged. Douglas Mackey, the man behind the
Twitter character Ricky Vaughn, is awaiting trial for the crime of
making fun of the anti-Trump people online.

The model for what Trudeau is doing is January 6th. Left-wing rioters
disrupted the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings for a week. Nothing
happened to any of them, but hundreds of Trump supporters face long
prison terms for the crime of disrupting official proceedings, despite
no official proceedings at the time. Trudeau is simply following the
lead of Washington. The fawning praise from the media as he seizes
control of Canadian society is confirming his understanding of the new
rules.

Apartheid came to mean racial discrimination, but in reality, it was an
authoritarian political culture that created a hierarchy of citizenship.
In the case of Africa, it was the white founding population that sat at
the top. It was not particularly different from the caste system on the
Indian subcontinent. Instead of culture defining the layers, the African
system was based on definitions of race. What is shaping up in the West
is an apartheid system based on perceived political beliefs.

In the case of Canada, Trudeau and the rest of the political class are
committed to the post-Marxist ideology that has evolved in the elite.
That is at the top of the new political order and those who worship at
that alter have full privileges. At the bottom are those who hold what
are defined as the most dangerous ideas, things like nativism,
patriotism and nationalism. Those people will have the least privileges.
As Macron made clear during Covid, these people are not even people.

Again, notice that the limited commentary in the conservative space is
not using the old lines about hypocrisy. The reason for this is the
so-called conservatives do not see hypocrisy in these actions, because
they fully approve of the new order. They agree with their friends on
the Left that those old liberal values are part of the basket of ideas
associated with who Hillary Clinton labeled deplorables. Their quibbles
are with small issues like the implementation and the optics.

January 6th and now the trucker protests are stops in this great
transformation of society by the unitary hive mind of the managerial
elite. Derek Chauvin goes to jail for life for the death of George
Floyd. Kim Potter gets two years in jail for shooting an unarmed man in
a traffic stop. Mohamed Noor got four years for executing a white woman
trying to flag down the police. Everything is now defined by this new
hierarchy as conceived by the hive mind.

There is no one inside the hive mind to object to this transformation,
because that risks being ejected from the protection of the collective.
The random cruelty of the system against its perceived opponents is as
much about defending itself from internal dissent as it is from external
threat. If the police are laughing about trampling old people with their
horses, they are not going to question the order to drag a party member
from his home in the middle of the night.

This is the new world order. At the top is this uniformity of opinion
rooted in two assumed truths about the world. One is the people at the
top have a duty to root out the enemies of the system. The other is the
enemies of the system lie in the populations over whom the system rules.
Like the old apartheid system, it is a system organized around a
permanent threat. In such a system internal dissent can never be
tolerated as it threatens to weaken the defenses.

This is why the conservatives are so muted. It is also why the far-left
in Canada voted to support the power grab, despite their alleged
opposition to such things. The far-left instinctively knows how
partisanship operates. There is no equivocation on their part, because
they understand the game. The conservatives will need to purge a few of
their members to finally get themselves in the good graces of their
colleagues. In the end, they will support the new apartheid system.
