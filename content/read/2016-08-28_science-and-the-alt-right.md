One of the stranger aspects of some corners of the alt-right is the
hostility to science. I don’t want to say it is a rejection of science,
but something like an extreme skepticism about it. I was reminded of
this reading Vox Day’s
<a href="https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/08/what-alt-right-is.html"
target="_blank">16-point manifesto</a> the other day. The part that
jumped out to me is this one:

> The Alt Right is scientodific. It presumptively accepts the current
> conclusions of the scientific method (scientody), while understanding
> a) these conclusions are liable to future revision, b) that
> scientistry is susceptible to corruption, and c) that the so-called
> scientific consensus is not based on scientody, but democracy, and is
> therefore intrinsically unscientific.

Vox seems to be trying very hard to declare himself the Pope of the
alt-right so perhaps he is just getting carried away with himself with
these posts, but he has made a big deal about being
an anti-evolutionists that regularly [kits himself out in the Don
Quixote suit and runs around tilting at imaginary
concepts](https://voxday.blogspot.com/2007/07/why-scientists-are-afraid-to-debate.html).
Usually, people opposed to evolution are coming at it from the
perspective of self-styled Christians¹. That’s not the case with Vox as
you see in [this post titled The Crisis in
Science](https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-crisis-in-science.html).

There is no crisis in science. The soft sciences like psychology and
sociology are certainly in trouble, but people have known that for a
very long time. It’s not just the bogus studies either. It is the hard
sciences, particularly biology, that are collapsing soft sciences like
psychology. Once you arrive at a biochemical explanation for mental
illness, there’s no need for guys in turtlenecks, smoking pipes and
asking about your mother. Genetics is rendering many of the soft
sciences meaningless, by exploding blank slatism.

The replication crisis that is bedeviling the soft science is not a
problem in chemistry, physics or even biology where speculation is more
common. The reason there is a replication crisis is the empirically
minded from the hard sciences grew tired of the bullshit coming from the
sociology department, showing up in the news as real science. It is
science policing itself by enforcing the rules of science on those who
seek to appropriate science for their own ends. This is a normal part of
the scientific process.

What’s puzzling about the anti-science elements on the alt-right is they
are not really motivated by religion, like we see with most
Progressives. Rejecting science because it violates your deeply held
beliefs is not irrational. It may be wrong, but it is not irrational.
The anti-science people in the alt-right seem to be responding to the
identity politics of the Left, which often waves the flag of science to
justify their crackpot ideas. Since it takes too long to refute the
Progressive pseudo-science, some on the alt-right simply reject science,
or at least large parts of it.

This is to some degree understandable, as the alt-right is mostly a
reaction to the extremism of the social justice movement. The unhinged
assault on normalcy is often dressed up in the language of science. A
degenerate in a sundress, who wants to watch your daughter pee, is
excused as transgender, as if such a thing exists. People with
Ph.D’s* *step forward* *to tell us how biological sex is a social
construct and that there are unlimited number of “non-binary
identities.” It perfectly understandable that normal people will get a
little skeptical of scientists.

The interesting part of this is that big part of the alt-right is rooted
in the growing fields of genetics, evolutionary biology and the
cognitive sciences. Guys like Steve Sailer and John Derbyshire have been
intellectual heavy weights of the movement for two decades, largely due
to popularizing research in the cognitive sciences that contradict the
Progressive faith. More than a few evolution guys have been “<a
href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12835-james-watson-retires-amidst-race-controversy/"
target="_blank">Watsoned</a>” for promoting ideas from evolutionary
biology.  Frankly, there would not be Vox Day if not for the science
guys and their wild tales about evolution.

That’s the other interesting strangeness about the thing the press is
now calling the alt-right. There’s a wide diversity of opinion within it
and a wide diversity of opinion about what it is. Greg Cochran, I’m
guessing, would laugh off the assertions of Vox Day, but guys like
Richard Spencer would dismiss people like Razib Khan. Yet, there would
be broad agreement among all of them when it comes to critiquing the
prevailing orthodoxy. That suggests the anti-science stuff is just a way
to make magic fit reality. Self-delusion is powerful stuff and not
always a bad thing.

¹<span style="font-size: small;">I’m sympathetic to creationist because
they are harmless and their beliefs tend toward the sort of positive
outcomes that make for a healthy Western society. You can be a great
engineer and still believe Adam and Eve rode around on dinosaurs in the
Garden of Eden. On the other hand, I have no tolerance for intelligent
design people. They paganize the Christian concept of God, turning him
into a fickle teenager, who alters the laws of nature for no reason.
Intelligent design is not just anti-science, it is
anti-Christian.</span>
