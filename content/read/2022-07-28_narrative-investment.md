The sunk cost fallacy is the belief that prior commitment to some action
requires continued commitment in order to regain the prior investment.
Another way of stating this is throwing good money after bad. You
invested in a project that is not going well but you keep putting money
into it thinking that success will not only justify the next investment
but recoup the prior investment. Despite this being a well know error,
even very smart people fall into the sunk cost trap.

That may be something we are seeing with the Federal Reserve. Back when
prices started to edge up, they created a narrative that explained the
rising prices as the result of supply chain issues. Those supply chain
issues were caused by the crackdowns during Covid that closed down the
global economy. The narrative said that once the crackdowns ended, the
supply chains would eventually return to normal and prices would then
return to normal as well.

For reasons that no one has bothered to explain, this narrative was
extremely attractive to the political class. They loved this story. The
most likely reason it was so appealing is it promised them a triumph
without effort. There would be a period of inflation then prices would
re-normalize and they could take credit for it. They invested in this
narrative based solely on future gains. Maybe this is why the Federal
Reserve stuck with this story. It took pressure off of them.

We will never know why they invested in this crackpot idea but we can
guess as to why they are continuing to invest in it. Even though they
have stopped with the “transitory” messaging, the actions of the central
bank make clear they still believe. Raising rates by three quarters of a
percent is not a bold move. Given that we have double digit inflation
and a global energy crisis, it is a grudging move. They still believe
inflation is transitory but are raising rates for other reasons.

Maybe one reason they are sticking with the narrative is the markets
seem to be deeply invested as well. Economic history says that these
levels of inflation require a monetary shock to arrest them. The way to
cure double digit inflation is to radically reduce the money supply,
thus inducing a recession. The steep recession clears away the free
riders and inefficient elements in the economy. This is like starting
fresh with clear signals about the proper money supply.

Even though there are plenty of geezers kicking around Wall Street who
remember the 1970’s and the actions of the Volker, everyone seems to be
convinced that the rate hikes are short term. They can only believe this
for two reasons. One is they think Powel is a coward and will never do
what Volker did. Insiders have determined that the politics at the
highest level are against a bold move and Powell is not a man willing to
challenge the politicians on monetary policy.

The other possibility is they are just as invested in the transitory
narrative as everyone in the political class. Wall Street is now hooked
on hopium. They are sure that in time everything will work out. China
will come back on-line, the war against Russia will come to an end and
the flow of free money from the Fed will return to normal. In other
words, they are investing in the original narrative because they have
come this far, they may as well see it to the very end.

Of course, there are secret reasons that could explain things. Perhaps
we are living in a simulation and the people controlling the rules of
our universe have changed the rules such that double digit inflation is
good. Maybe the ruling class has come to believe that only by making
everyone poorer will Gaia be happy with us. It is possible that everyone
in power has gone insane. There is a case to be made that we have
crossed out of the domain of reason into the world of fantasy.

Sticking with what we can know, the best guess is that the Federal
Reserve, Washington and Wall Street are simply committed to the
narrative. They may have stopped using the phrase “transitory” for
public relations reasons, but they are still committed to the transitory
narrative. To change course as economic history suggests would mean
abandoning their investment in the narrative. Even though that is the
right course, they are psychology unprepared for it.

There is some history here. It has been forgotten that the two Fed
chairs prior to Volker were a lot like Powell. Burns and Miller were
both doves when it came to policy and they are credited with what came
to be known as stagflation. Supposedly, the great lesson learned during
the Volker tenure was that bold action from the central bank is the key
to heading off catastrophe. The official narrative says that timid
policy by the central bank is what caused the Great Depression.

Like a family business run by the third generation, the people running
economic policy have no experience with tough times, so they are
unprepared to take the bold actions the age requires. These are all men
who rose up in good times, when ticking the right boxes is what
mattered. Questioning orthodoxy was the best way to end a career, so the
careerists in the system are all men who never question orthodoxy. Powel
is simply this generation’s Arthur Burns.

The thing is though, the people in the 1970’s were in a world that said
stagflation was impossible based on current economic theory. They could
be forgiven for thinking that the recession would cure the inflation on
its own. The current batch of economic leaders have the benefit of
having lived through the 1970’s and 1980’s. They have either come to
believe that this is not the same situation or they are so invested in
that narrative they are no longer able to change course.

There is always the prospect that they are right. Maybe if given enough
time global markets will normalize, energy flows will return to normal
and the inflation we are seeing will slowly decline. There is no
evidence of this happening in the short term but wait long enough and
anything is possible. As the founder of modern economics famously said,
in the long run we are all dead. None of us live in the long term, which
is what makes this explanation uncompelling.

We may be seeing one of the terrible side effects of narrative politics.
This is the belief that a good story often repeated can change reality.
Elites have come to believe that saying it makes it real. This is why
they invest so heavily in creating narratives and having them repeated
by their media organs. Everything is about messaging rather than
objective measures. Team Biden is now selling the story that gas prices
are falling at historic rates, despite record high gas prices.

In a world where the people in charge are sure that all they have to do
is create a really good story and that story will become true, there is
no reason for them to ever reconsider the narrative. Once they commit,
they are committed. This means anyone questioning the narrative is an
enemy. Public policy ceases to be about trade-offs and is instead about
the friend-enemy distinction. Friends repeat the narrative and enemies
question the narrative.
