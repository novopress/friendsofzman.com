It has become trite to point out that the lovers of democracy have a one
way relationship with it. When the results of an election are favorable
to the ruling class, they praise democracy. When the results are
something other than what the rulers wanted, then you can no longer
trust the process. The United States has spent the last six years torn
between these two competing forces. The 2016 election was rigged while
the 2020 election was the most bizarrely pure result ever.

We are about to get another dose of this in Europe as elections go the
wrong way for the people who actually run Europe. In Sweden, the
normally passive Swedes decided to send a very mild message to their
ruling class by giving a bunch of votes to the Swedish Democrats. This
allowed a moderate coalition to form up and depose the Social Democrats,
which has been the ruling party for decades. For the
<a href="https://archive.ph/LEeT9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">usual
suspects</a>, this means snow Hitler is around the corner.

An honest assessment of the Swedish election would start with why it has
taken so long for the Swedes to push back against the system. Decades of
immigration have turned Sweden into the rape capital of Europe. Large
swaths of Swedish cities have become no-go zones thanks to the migrants.
The city of Malmo has become famous for its problem with grenade
attacks. Rival gangs of migrants use their skills learned at home to
turn the once peaceful city into a war zone.

At least some of the Swedes have decided that they can risk being called
bad things in order to send a message. For this to happen, however, the
Swedish Democrats had to drop all of their tough talk and position
themselves as reformed heretics who will only gently rock the boat a
tiny bit. It is a good reminder that whoever controls the moral
framework, controls the moral consensus. In order to participate in
democracy, you must submit to the moral consensus.

This past weekend, the Italians did the unthinkable and elected a female
as the next leader of the country. Before the election, the unelected
president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned the
Italians that she has a particular set of skills and is not afraid to
use them if they vote the wrong way. The Italians being Italian were
happy to give her the now famous solute and vote for a block of
right-of-center parties in Sunday’s elections.

Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, will be the next
prime minister, as her party received about 25% of the vote. Salvini’s
League and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia will give the coalition a majority
of seats in both chambers. The Brothers of Italy managed just four
percent of the vote in the prior election and has been viewed as a
fringe party with little impact on Italian politics. Suddenly, their
pro-family and anti-immigration message is resonating with Italians.

Of course, the <a
href="https://theconversation.com/giorgia-meloni-and-the-return-of-fascism-how-italy-got-here-190866"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">usual suspects</a> have branded Meloni a
fascist. You see, anyone who falls outside the moral consensus is a
fascist. To her credit, this has not had to desired effect on Meloni’s
rhetoric. Her
<a href="https://twitter.com/RyanGirdusky/status/1574150785352585222"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">victory speech</a> was refreshingly
moral. “Yes to natural families, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual
identity, no to gender ideology, yes to the culture of life, no to the
abyss of death, no to the violence of Islam, yes to safer borders, no to
mass immigration, yes to work for our people”

The same people who tell Europeans they must heat their homes with
candles and get used to cold showers in the name of democracy in
Ukraine, will now set to work undermining these two democracies. The
Swedish Democrats have been accused of apostacy with regards to Russia.
Silvio Berlusconi has been accused of being a Putin ally by the usual
suspects. It is not hard to see where this is going. If you vote the
wrong way, you are on the side of Russia.

Getting back to Ursula von der Leyen, you can be sure she will start
pressing the new governments to pray at the feet of the moral consensus.
Her primary weapon is financial, which she is now using against Hungary.
The voters there support Viktor Orbán, who is no fan of men in dresses
chasing girls in public toilets. The EU has thus declared that Hungary
is not really democratic, despite their democracy. This means the EU
will not begin withholding tens of billions in money.

All of this should be familiar to Americans. Voters sent a message to
the ruling class in 2016 when they put Donald Trump in the White House.
The message was received and the ruling class has been making war on
those voters ever since. In a democracy, a legitimate result is one that
pleases the permanent ruling elite. Anything that even questions the
elite moral consensus is a threat to our democracy. The Swedes and
Italians are about to learn this lesson.

The reality of Western democracy is that it is a weird form of
colonialism where the rulers demand regular affirmation from the ruled.
The point of elections is for the people to thank their rulers for their
service. The rulers are naturally offended when the voters fail to hold
up their end of the bargain. The social compact in Western democracy is
that the ruling class commands and the voters obey. Anything else is a
threat to our democracy and requires any means necessary to thwart it.

This is why elections have had no impact on policy in America. This <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">exhaustive study</a> from 2014 makes
plain that voting means nothing. “Multivariate analysis indicates that
economic elites and organized groups representing business interests
have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while
average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no
independent influence.” As the saying goes, there is no voting your way
out of the problems of democracy.

It is not all bad news. The continued support for Trump in America and
now the elections in Europe suggest the people are slowly beginning to
slip free from the tentacles of the imposed moral consensus. Even the
normally passive Swedes are starting to look their masters in the eye
and ask, “who says?” If enough people begin to wake up from the
nightmare of liberal democracy, they may begin to break free from the
underlying morality of it.

What the West will need to save itself is not bureaucrats promising to
worship a system, but leaders who understand it is not *how*, but *who*.
It is not how decisions are made, but who makes them. For Italy to
regain itself, it must be Italians who make the decisions, not Brussels
bureaucrats. For America to reclaim its nature, it must be Americans
making the decisions, not an alien managerial elite. The demon of
democracy is it leads people to forget this basic reality of life.
