Uneasy Start, Finding Common Ground to Discuss Race Relations at Work

*Carl Jones brought it up over lunch in the company break room: the news
of the shooting death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer.
“Did you read about it?” Mr. Jones, a software engineer who is black,
remembers asking his colleagues. “How could this happen?”*

*He told his white and Asian-American co-workers about his feelings of
outrage as they ate Korean takeout at the lunch table at their
technology company in Manhattan. He described the waves of anger and
anxiety sweeping over him.*

*Mr. Jones, the only black employee in his department, had always talked
with his work friends about sports, movies and current events. But this
conversation last summer was different. One white colleague challenged
him, asking: “How do you know the shooting wasn’t justified?” Others
averted their eyes and finished the meal in silence.*

*He knew then that he had crossed an invisible line. The discussion of
race that day changed the social dynamics at the table, chilling his
co-workers’ camaraderie.*

*“Everyone did their best to avoid the conversation,” Mr. Jones, 33,
recalled last week as he described the day that he discussed [the
shooting in Ferguson,
Mo](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/darren-wilson-is-cleared-of-rights-violations-in-ferguson-shooting.html?_r=0).
Race is often the elephant in the room, he said, and “a lot of times
people feel uncomfortable talking about it.”*

The reason they are uncomfortable would have nothing to do with the fact
you can quickly get fired, if you are white, by talking about race. It
has nothing to do with how guys like Razib Khan get sacked by the
NYTimes for talking about race. Nope. Nothing to see here.

The universal attribute of all cults is a lack of self-awareness. The
Times enforces a strict and ruthless set of speech codes at its offices.
It works hard to enforce those codes outside its offices, by slandering
people who violate those codes. Yet, they run stories like this one,
totally unaware of how ridiculous it makes them look.
