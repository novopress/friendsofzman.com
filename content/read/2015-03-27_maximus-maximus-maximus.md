accused of pit-fighting inmates</a>

*San Francisco sheriff’s deputy Scott Neu is accused of leading a ring
of corrupt jail guards who coerced prisoners into gladiatorial combat
with threats of rape and violence.*

*Neu serves at County Jail No. 4 at 850 Bryant St despite having settled
claims that he raped a woman prisoner and two transgendered prisoners
while working at the jail. He sports a tattoo reading “850 Mob,”
believed to describe the name used by the corrupt deputies to describe
themselves. At least four other deputies are implicated in the program
of sexualized torture.*

*The San Francisco Public Defender’s Office had undertaken an
investigation into Neu’s behavior, in cooperation with an independent
private investigator, and had planned to issue their report only after
the prisoners who came forward were released and safe from retaliatory
violence. However, Neu had reportedly planned a fresh round of fights,
leading to a hasty release of their findings.*

*Neu and his co-conspirators gambled on the outcome of fights. One fight
pitted the smallest inmate in the jail against the largest, and the
fighters say they were threatened with rape and beatings by the guards
if they didn’t spar. Neu is also said to have coerced prisoners into
training for the fights with threats of rape and violence. Neu has a
reputation for sadistic practices overall, including making prisoners
gamble to receive their food, clothes and comfort items. Even when
prisoners won the games Neu forced on them with the red dice and the
deck of cards he carried, he would sometimes take away their “winnings”
and give them to other prisoners.*

*The Deputies’ Union attorney Harry Stern claims the Public Defender is
making a big deal out of nothing. He says that the prisoners were
encouraged to “wrestle to settle disputes about who was stronger,” and
were “encouraged” to work out. He dismissed the entire affair as “little
more than horseplay.”*

The rape business is the great unspoken horror in modern America. The
number of prison rapes of men is higher than all female rapes. It is a
barbaric aspect of the prison system that is quietly and not so quietly
tolerated. Think of all the times you’ve heard someone make a joke about
a guy getting raped in prison.

The other aspect of our prisons that does not get mentioned is the
guards. Most prison guards are sadists. Many are criminals. It’s the
most obvious example of how poorly we handle the criminal class in
America.
