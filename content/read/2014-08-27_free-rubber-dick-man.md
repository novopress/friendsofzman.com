It is incorrectly assumes that to be on the side of order means
unconditional backing of the police. The fact is, good order should
require a light touch, as the laws become a habit of mind and the laws
reflect the collective habit of mind. When the laws are odds with the
culture, you get disorder, which requires forces to maintain order. That
force comes with consequences. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s an hilarious
example</a> from Pittsburgh.

*A young man is facing charges stemming from an unusual incident in
Westmoreland County Monday.*

*Skyler Connor, 18, of New Derry, is facing a disorderly conduct charge
for waving a rubber penis at passing motorists.*

*According to police, the incident happened on Route 30 in Unity
Township around 6 p.m.*

*Connor was a passenger in the back seat of a vehicle at the time.*

The people who wrote the disorderly conduct laws never intended to give
the cops the power to regulate teenage pranks. The intent of such laws
are to prevent people from disrupting the normal functioning of public
activities. Someone drunk in public harassing citizens is an example.
Tying up traffic with some sort of distraction like a parade float or
naked women could be a public nuisance. A kid waving around a rubber
dick is not disrupting public order.

This is also a good example of anarcho-tyranny. You can be sure the cop
who made the arrest had a few grand worth of battle gear and was driving
a squad car kitted out like a starship. The cops are hyper-vigilant
about stupid things like this that have no value to society. Yet, these
same cops cannot be bothered to look for stolen cars or roust the hobos
out of the local library. The cops treat the citizens as a nuisance,
rather than the people they serve.
