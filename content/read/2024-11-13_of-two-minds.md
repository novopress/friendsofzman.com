Everyone in every time has thought that his time was crazier and less
predictable than the times that came before him. Much of this is due to
recency bias, but another cause is the sense that things were better in
the past. This sense that the past was better is a part of the human
makeup. There is not only a nostalgia for the our own past, but for the
past we never experienced. That is because the past seems more certain
than our present age and the near future.

People who lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War
looked back at those days with fondness. These were people enjoying
1950’s America reminiscing about one of the worst times in American
history. Many even lost family members in the war, but those war years
felt like the best of times. Our minds seem to have evolved in such a
way that we cannot remember pain. That means what we can recall about
our past is only the good feelings we experienced.

It also depends upon who you are at the time as well. If you were a
black person in the 1950’s then it was a wild time to be alive. The
civil right revolution was getting going and the role blacks were given
was to riot in the streets. The typical white guy living in California
was just enjoying his time. On the other hand, the war years were a good
time to be black in America as the war economy needed labor. Millions of
black people found lucrative work in northern cities.

That is something to keep in mind while watching present events. It
certainly seems like it is a crazy time to be alive. The whole Trump
thing is wild, just from the perspective of American politics. People
also seem nuttier. This was evident during the Covid panic when millions
of otherwise normal looking people revealed themselves to be bitter
paranoid cranks. Now the
<a href="https://x.com/IanJaeger29/status/1856338845005951425"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-Trump loons</a> are going into
hiding, by which they mean the latest alternative to Twitter.

It is not just the usual suspects losing their minds over the election.
The British tabloid The Guardian has
<a href="https://x.com/guardian/status/1856659228649271588"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on Twitter, oddly enough,
that it is stomping off in a huff, presumably to set up shop on the
alternative to Twitter. They claim it is because of the “far-right
conspiracy theories and racism.” That means a publication that traffics
in conspiracy theories about the imaginary far-right and racism is
abandoning the one place they are sure such things exist.

Even putting aside the natural bias described at the start, this is
crazy behavior that did not exist just ten years ago. The crazy times
ten years ago were both sides meeting in the streets to point fingers
and maybe scuffle a bit. More important, the people we call the left had
institutional support, so they controlled the battlefield. This fact has
been true for as long as anyone has been alive, so seeing them abandon
the battlefield and go into hiding qualifies this as a crazy time to be
alive.

Of course, the reason this is happening is the big election victory of
Donald Trump and the temporary ascendency of his party. It was not just
a big win for Trump on Tuesday, but also a big win for the movement that
made him possible. The reason that movement exists is the growing
insanity of the people we call the left. In other words, we probably do
live in a crazy age, even when people have the ability to step back and
look at it from a distance. This really is a crazy age.

The thing about this crazy age is that not much is happening. The
exciting times a century ago revolved around the Great War. The
mobilization of America for war in Europe was unprecedented. The war
itself was unprecedented, and its aftermath was also unprecedented.
Enormously important things were happening. In this present age,
everything happens on the internet and slightly affects events outside
the digital space, but only in superficial ways.

Put another way, we live in a crazy time because this new virtual
reality we created called the internet has sucked into it many of our
least stable people, empowering them to unleash their craziness in this
virtual realm. Imagine a version of the past twenty years in which the
crazy people were denied access to the internet. Imagine if all the
foreign policy debates since the Cold War had been conducted online by
people like John Mearsheimer rather than crazies from the Kagan cult.

What makes this a crazy time is we are living in a unique period and
what makes it unique is this virtual realm we call the internet.
Everyone is forced to one degree or another to live with two minds.
There is the mind that exists in the virtual realm and then there is the
mind that exists in the physical realm. Note that you rarely discuss
with people in the physical realm your life in the virtual realm. These
are two distinct worlds that require two distinct minds.

On the other hand, the growth of this new virtual world has had the
effect of collapsing the two minds for some people. The crazies online
are made crazy, in part, by the invasion of the private space by the
public space. Prior to the internet, these people could only do politics
by participating in it publicly. Most just avoided politics and remained
privately nuts, but free of public politics. Plugged into the internet,
the public rushes into the private and the private becomes public.

This may explain the phenomenon of the seemingly stable person heading
off into crazy land as they get increasingly online. People like James
Lindsay or Keith Olbermann are good examples of people who started out a
bit odd, but not so odd that you questioned their sanity. They steadily
evolved into crazy people online. When there was separation between
their public and private mind, we did not see the madness, because it
existed outside of public view.

In the fullness of time, people may look at this time and think it was
the calm waters before the terrible rapids. Maybe they look at this is
as a gentle adjustment period between the Cold War and whatever comes
next. it is also possible that it is the crazy time when people had to
adjust to the two-mind problem. The growth of the virtual realm created
a need for an entirely novel mode of thought, the mind you activate when
inside the internet, along with a way of isolating it from the other
mind.

It may be that we arrive at a new way of judging people. At the top of
the hierarchy are those who master both minds, deftly balancing them to
be high status in both the material world and the virtual world. At the
bottom are the people who allow the virtual realm to take over their
mind entirely, making it seem that they are as crazy in real life as
they seem online. In the middle are the vast majority who struggle to
balance their internet mind with their material mind.
