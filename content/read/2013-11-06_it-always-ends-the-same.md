Ken Cuccinelli, the failed gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, is a bit
of mystery, unless you live in Virginia or you are a political junkie.
He was the attorney general and he is conservative on social issues. No
one claims he wants to stone gays in public or horse whip adulterers, so
he is probably conventional in his politics. He appears to be the
standard issue socially conservative Republican that has been around for
years.

Terry McAuliffe, in contrast, is a well-known quantity. He is a
sociopath, who spent most of the 1990’s defending the indefensible on
cable chat shows.  Political flaks are notorious liars, much like
attorneys and boxing promoters, but this guy was unusually slimy. The
aging shock jock, Don Imus, told him to his face that he makes him want
to bleach his eyeballs after seeing him. The guy’s post-Clinton career
was one shady business deal after another, all involving ripping off
taxpayers. <a

This is why democracies murder themselves, or at least why we say it.
There is a large number of adults in every population incapable of
participating in public decisions. They are stupid, lazy or criminal.
They lack the ability to put aside their narrow immediate interests in
favor of the long-term interests of society. In the case of Virginia, a
large number of voters live in NoVa and work in do-nothing jobs for the
government or for do-nothing government contractors.

In the Tidewater area and around Richmond, you have large numbers of
blacks who look at the government as their sugar daddy. Anyone promising
more hand-outs gets their vote and the democrat is always the one
promising more handouts.  Added to that are South American peasants, who
are allowed to vote. That reason is they will gladly vote for the
Democrat. In fact, they will let someone vote for them, so they don’t
have to show up at the polls. Election fraud and immigration are almost
synonymous now.

McAuliffe went around the state promising these folks he would rob the
taxpayers and property holders and give some of it to these various
welfare cases. Of course, they voted for him. It is a microcosm of what
is going in in the country. The number of people in favor of robbing the
productive class has grown to a point where you must get some of that
vote in order to win. The deadbeats are oddly motivated to
vote.<span style="line-height: 1.625;">The taxpayer is often so
discouraged, they don’t bother. </span>

Then there is the morality angle. The Democrats turn every race into a
referendum on the bad whites, those people who oppose immigration, want
tom live free of blacks and and think local autonomy is a good thing.
They are the bad guys, because they are the bad whites who are not
ashamed to be white. That means your choice in an election is often
between two good whites or between a good white and bad white. Publicly
supporting the bad white is to go against public morality and no one
relishes that.

This is nothing new. The Greeks eventually voted themselves to death.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Alcibiades</a> was the Bill Clinton of his day. He had
no real accomplishments to his name, but he was able to charm the
average Greek. In fact, he charmed them into invading Sicily, which
brought Greek democracy to a bad end. The Romans eventually abandoned
democracy for a dictator, leading to such wonderful guys as Caligula,
but even a degenerate lunatic is often viewed as an upgrade of a
champion of democracy like Terry McAuliffe.
