There are many theories for why the Roman Republic became unstable and
eventually collapsed into what we think of as authoritarianism. Given
America’s republican history, the collapse of the Roman Republic has
been something like Banquo’s ghost, especially for those who call
themselves conservatives. Each new innovation is a threat to the
republic. The progressives have the same fear, despite their obvious
disdain for the republican concept. Caesarism haunts their dreams.

The funny thing about the fall of the Roman Republic is that it was
largely the result of trying to save it. When Caesar crossed the
Rubicon, he did not think of himself as the destroyer of Rome. He was
saving Rome. Sure, he was violating important rules of the Republic, but
Rome was too important to worry about petty things. While the idea of a
republic assumes that the means justify the ends, saving the Republic
was based on the ends justifying the means.

Caesar could not have existed if not for the example of Sulla. He became
the key figure in the struggle between the *optimates* and *populares*
factions. The former backed the supremacy of the senate, while the
latter supported the popular reforms of Sulla’s former mentor, Gaius
Marius. Sulla marched on Rome in an unprecedented act to defeat the
*populares* and then did it a second time to deliver the final defeat at
the [Battle of the Colline
Gate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Colline_Gate)

Interestingly, Sulla was made possible by the man he eventually defeated
and who he once served in his own efforts to save the Republic. Gaius
Marius was a general and a statesman who won the Cimbric and Jugurthine
wars. In doing so he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven
times. Prior to Marius, the custom was to retire from politics after
reaching the position of Consul, but the Republic needed the skilled
Marius, so to save the Republic exceptions were made.

Of course, the reason for those extraordinary circumstances was that the
opposition in the Jugurthine wars had been able to bribe Roman senators.
Jugurtha was a king of Numidia who claimed the entire kingdom of
Numidia. This was in defiance of Rome, but he was able to first bribe
some senators to get favorable terms and then he bribed Roman generals
when war started. Rome needed to make exceptions for Marius because the
best Roman citizens were no longer trusted.

You can probably start with the founding of the Roman Republic, the day
Brutus stood and watched his own sons be executed for their role in the
Tarquinian conspiracy, and chart the exceptions made until Caesar
crossed the Rubicon. At first it was mostly personal corruption, small
things that were overlooked to keep the peace. Over time it was
exceptions to the rules for expediency’s sake. Each time an exception
was made, it laid the groundwork for the next exception.

In the future, the robot historians will do the same thing charting the
arc of the American republic as it made exceptions here and there, all
in the name of expediency to save “our democracy” from some evil. In
each case, the people breaking the rules or violating custom have
justified what they were doing by claiming that they were breaking the
rules in order to save the system. As with the Roman Republic, the
American republic has fallen victim to those who claiming to save it.

We are seeing this with the latest batch of indictments of Donald Trump.
In fact, the Donald Trump story arc is a microcosm of the process. It <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/donald-trump-conservatives-oppose-nomination/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">started</a> with the so-called
conservatives openly siding with their alleged opponents. You see, they
were breaking their word because the greater good demanded it. This was
the start of a process by which each new violation of the rules and
customs is normalized and justified, thus making the next more egregious
violation possible.

That process kicked off by Conservative Inc. has led to the last batch
of indictments of Donald Trump, which now come with the promise of a
rigged trial. The case has been assigned to one of the more corrupt and
partisan judges in the system. Unlike the previous charges in Florida,
which came with a judge that maintained the façade of impartiality, this
judge is a crook and lunatic. This case may as well be held in the Oval
Office with Hillary Clinton has judge and jury.

This now paves the way for the Republican Party to change their rules in
order to keep Trump off the ballot. They will no doubt claim they are
doing this to save the party or save the republic. You see, they are not
succumbing to corruption or merely breaking their own rules. No, they
are sacrificing in order to save the system from something they say is
much worse than breaking the rules. In this process, there is always
something worse than breaking the rules.

It is one of the ironies of the human condition. All human societies
begin with the question, “who are we?” The answer is a set of rules that
define who is in and who is not in the society. Inevitably, there are
people who slither in seeking to undermine those rules by looking for
loopholes and exceptions. Before long, some people start to see the
rules as an obstacle. As the rules give way to this process, the only
way to save the rules is to abandon the spirit of them entirely.

Of course, we have the expression “crossing the Rubicon” for a reason.
When Caesar made the decision to march on Rome, the Republic was over,
as there was no way to put it back together, even if Caesar was
defeated. We see this happening with the political persecution of Trump.
The people doing it are not going to be talked out of their next brazen
violation of the rules. The only way to stop them is to physically
remove them from society by any means necessary.
