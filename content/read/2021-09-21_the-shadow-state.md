Imagine if at your place of work, you began to suspect that many of your
coworkers were members of a secret organization. At first you notice
that when one has an idea, all of them suddenly adopt it. One day one
will use a turn of phrase and then all of them are using it, as if on
command. They display no outward expression of membership in a secret
group, but their behavior suggests they are controlled by the same
source, or they are coordinated by some unknown actor.

This would have been the experience of Donald Trump when he took office.
He knew, of course, that many of the people he inherited were loyalists
to the Bush crime family or the Clinton crime family. That was part of
his campaign, rooting out these people as bad for the American people.
What he did not understand is that even the people who appeared to
support him in Washington were part of an informal club. The Bush and
Clinton clans were just manifestations of this secret club.

That seems farfetched, but take a look at <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/23/westexec-advisors-biden-cabinet-440072"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> in Politico about what they
call “the secretive consulting firm that’s become Biden’s Cabinet in
waiting”. The short version of it is that a “consulting firm” operated
as a shadow administration while the Democrats were out of power. When
Biden was installed, in was from this shadow government that he picked
key appointees. The source of funding for what amounts to a secret
society is not mentioned, but it is not hard to guess.

In many respects, Biden represents a return to a trend that began under
the first George Bush and has become more obvious over time. That is,
the president is a figure head representing a faction within Washington.
Up to Ronald Reagan, new presidents tended to bring key people from
their home state, who took up key positions and helped vet new hires in
the administration. Over time they were assimilated into the Borg, but
initially they offered a fresh perspective and a change in direction.

With Bush I, that started to change. His administration was from the
Borg as Bush no longer had ties to normal America. The Bush family’s
closest relationships were not to local elites in America, but to the
Saudi royal family, Mexican drug cartels and the American intelligence
agencies. Bush was the first post-American president. He was followed by
Clinton, whose administration was filled with members of the
semi-permanent ruling elite based in Washington.

Bush II and Obama were basically spokesmen for organization that existed
in the shadows, like the one stocking the Biden administration. They
were also the most shallow and unaccomplished men to reach office.
Neither had done anything to that point that would warrant local
attention, much less national attention. They could have been hired from
a talent agency and trained to play the role. Obama famously used a
teleprompter for all public utterances.

One reason the imperial capital revolted when Trump was elected is he
was a break in the long evolutionary chain. By 2016, the people who
actually run the government had come to see the president as window
dressing to appease the masses. The real work of governance was done by
the thousands of people who live, work and socialize in the world’s
largest small town. From their perspective, he was a threat to their
democracy, because their democracy had become one party rule.

A good current example of how things really work in American democracy
is the case against former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann. The
judge in the case is Christopher Cooper, who is married to attorney Amy
Jefress. She represents key players in the FBI Russia hoax like Lisa
Page. Sussman’s lawyers are long time legal insiders serving the
Democratic Party. The Lawfare Group, which was deeply involved in the
Russia hoax, is helpfully providing <a
href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/special-counsels-weird-prosecution-michael-sussmann"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">commentary</a> to the media.

The reason that there could never be a legitimate investigation of the
FBI plot to overturn the 2016 election was everyone involved is
connected to everyone who would investigate or prosecute the case.
Washington is a separate society that is independent of the country over
whom it rules. Again, if you imagine it as a secret club, politics makes
a lot of sense. The part we see, campaigns, politicians, elections, is
controlled by the part we never see, the semi-permanent ruling class.

There is also reason to suspect that many of the people working in
politics are just as gullible as the people voting Republican. The
FBI-organized protest last weekend looks like it was more for the people
inside the wire than outside the wire. They wanted the rank and file in
Congress to see the storm troopers cracking skulls and flag waving
barbarians screaming for the cameras. The whole thing was an amusing
flop, but it kept Ocasio-Cortez up at night, which was the purpose.

Long ago, Pat Buchanan observed that local politicians are often quite
sensible, which is how they get bumped up to the House of Senate. The
people supporting them hope they will be a sane voice for their
interests. When they get to Washington, they quickly go native and
become just another voice of the ruling class. Buchanan wrote it off to
social influence, which is certainly true. The newly minted Congressman
is quickly socialized into the culture and is then assimilated into the
Borg.

Another reason though is the shadow government. These vast global
consulting firms that operate in every western capital but are based in
Washington operate like a secret society. They produce the people who
get appointments in every administration, and they produce the
candidates for spots on the bench. They don’t write regulations and
legislation, but they develop and curate the people who do. They have
evolved a system that is immune to the virus of elections.

What this means is that voting has become pointless. A system that is
immune to voting is not going to be fixed by more voting. In fact,
voting provides a false sense of legitimacy to the system. The dynamic
of liberal democracy is that voting not only strengthens the system,
making it even more resistant to elections, but it also encourages more
voting. The more that people participate, the less their voice matters
and the more shadowy the true ruling elite pulling the strings.
