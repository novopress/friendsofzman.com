I’ve been saying for a very long time that “social justice” just a nice
way of saying “revenge.” People used to know this. When the old ruler
was over thrown, the new ruler delivered swift justice to the former
ruler’s people. If the mob got angry enough, they would deliver “rough
justice” to the object of their anger. In the affairs of man, justice is
the winners punishing the losers.

Toni Morrison, the clownishly inept poet, at least has <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/toni-morrison-race-relations-america-criminal-justice-system"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the honesty to state what everyone
knows</a>, with regards to racism.

*The Nobel prize-winning author
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison"
class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag"
data-link-name="auto-linked-tag">Toni Morrison</a> has delivered a frank
assessment of race relations in America, declaring that until racial
disparities in the criminal justice system are resolved, the
conversation about racism will never be over.*

*Morrison, who won the Pulitzer prize in 1988 for her novel Beloved,
which <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/08/fiction.tonimorrison"
class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link"
data-link-name="in body link">told a story of racism and slavery</a> in
19th-century Kentucky and Ohio, drew on a recent spate of high-profile
killings of unarmed African Americans by law enforcement officials to
illustrate the ongoing struggle.*

*“People keep saying, ‘We need to have a conversation about race’,” <a
href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/11532385/Toni-Morrison-interview-on-racism-her-new-novel-and-Marlon-Brando.html"
class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link"
data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true">Morrison told the Daily
Telegraph</a>.*

*“This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed
teenager in the back.”*

*She added: “And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a black
woman. Then when you ask me, ‘Is it over?’, I will say yes.”*

Well, she could have seen a *four* white men convicted of raping a black
women. It was in 1959 in Florida, of all places, when four white men
were sent away for life in the rape of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Jean_Owens" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Betty Jean Owens</a>. After all, if she just wanted one
white man convicted, having four convicted must have her waddling around
in ecstasy.

As far as a cop shooting  a white kid, we have lots of examples. <a
href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/27/white-teen-gilbert-collar-killed-by-black-cop-trev/?page=all"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gilbert Collar</a> was shot by a black
cop in Alabama and not charged. Alabama! Just last year <a
href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/3/justice-dillon-taylor-after-white-utah-man-fatally/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dillon Taylor</a> was shot by a black
cop. Dillon was not only named “Dillon” he was unarmed. No charges in
that one either.

Now, maybe Toni Morrison is just a stupid person. But, she has been
smart enough to play the skins game well enough to get rich as a
colossally bad poet. No, I suspect she knows the truth of things. She
just hates white people and would enjoy seeing more white people suffer
and die. The cops could shoot a thousand white teenagers in the back
tonight and Morrison will want more.

I don’t blame her, really. She’s old and no one really cares what she
has to say about anything. She may as well let loose with what’s on her
mind. She also must think the tide of history is on the side of
nonwhites. Look around and ask yourself if she is wrong. She does not
have much time so just in case she is dead when American is majority
NAM, she has got her two cents in on what should be done.
