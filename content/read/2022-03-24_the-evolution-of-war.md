**Comments:** I know the spam filter has become annoying to some. I am
working on an alternative to what I am using. In the interim I have made
a few changes and will keep tinkering with the current system. Thank you
for your patience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first men to go to war with men from another tribe no doubt went to
that first battle with the weapons they used to hunt. We have no record
of that first battle, but we can safely assume it involved spears, clubs
and probably rocks. It is possible that the throwing rock was developed
just for these battles, as the thrown rock is much more effective
against men than animals. The throwing rock is probably the first weapon
developed just for killing other men.

One day a group of men decided to raid the territory of another tribe
and they were met with a terrifying new weapon, the bow and arrow.
Again, we have no idea when this happened, but logic says there was a
first time use for the bow in war. A group sorted out how to launch a
small version of their spear at an animal. This was much safer than
getting up close and personal. The next logical step was to use this
cool new weapon against invaders from another tribe.

Maybe it was the sling or maybe it was the bow, but most likely it was
the fear of projectile weapons that led to the shield and the use of it.
Shields are useful against spears, but they limit offensive ability.
Again, we will never know, but most likely there was a first battle
where the shield was used. The guys with bows were stunned to see this
new terrifying weapon. Instead of raining death down on their enemy,
their enemy was able to advance under the cover of their shields.

We are seeing this playout in Ukraine. The Russians are probably the
world’s best at tank strategy. They have a lot of them and they have
always been at the top in terms of tank technology. Russia is a land
power, so it makes sense that they are the best with the dominant
weapons of land warfare. In the Second World War it was the T-34 that
beat back the Nazis and drove them back to Berlin. It remains the most
popular tank in the world, despite being 80-years old.

The terrifying counter is the anti-tank weapon. The concept is pretty
simple. You launch a missile at a tank that can penetrate its armor. The
trick is either in hitting the tank from beyond its range or getting
close enough to hit it from a blind spot. This is where the modern
anti-tank weapons have become so important. The Javelin system allows a
team of two to get close, fire from cover and take out a tank. The
weapon is cheap and it can be used by the dumbest infantrymen.

The effects of this weapon are clear in Ukraine. Instead of leading with
their armor, the Russians have been forced to use artillery and cruise
missiles to soften up the line of contact and then use infantry to clear
the way for tanks. This has not made the tank obsolete, but it has
forced a change in its use. It now has to be deployed initially as a
stand-off weapon, like an artillery piece. Instead of being the tip of
the spear for ground forces, it is now a follow on weapon.

As an aside, this is a good example of the knock-on effect. Since the
anti-tank weapon neutralizes the tank, the counter is the use of
artillery. In the second Chechen war and now in Ukraine, the Russians
are relying on their massive artillery advantage, which is turning the
defensive positions into rubble. In other words, the Ukrainians will
still lose and they will have their cities reduced to dust. The
anti-tank weapon is making war bloodier and costlier to the civilian
population.

The West thinks this is all good news, but there is bad news for the
Global American Empire in Ukraine. For starters, the Russians have had
the chance to test their S-400 surface-to-air missile system against
serious opposition. It turns out to be as lethal as advertised, able to
take out aircraft from over 250-miles away. It is cheap, mobile and easy
to deploy in a wide range of conditions. It is to American air power
what the Javelin missile system is to Russian tank warfare.

The American way of war is to gain air superiority and then pound the
enemy from the sky until their mobility and communications are broken.
Then the ground forces come in to attack the weakened enemy positions.
The S-400 suddenly turns those 100-million dollar aerial weapons
platforms into expensive target practice. Since these systems are cheap
and getting cheaper, they will proliferate. It is why America threatens
every country that buys them with sanctions.

That is not the only bad news. The Russians have been testing what the
media is calling a hypersonic missile. The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal
air-to-surface system is probably not a hypersonic weapon, given the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTEhG8zzftQ" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">technical issues</a> involved with the technology, but
that does not matter. It is fast enough, lethal enough and cheap enough
to pose a serious problem for a sea power like America. The ability to
strike a relatively small target from over a thousand miles away is a
game changer.

The reason this is important is it means those carriers America relies
upon to project air power will quickly become expensive target practice.
Some have argued that this has already happened with land-based
anti-ship weapons, but that is disputed. This new system ends the
debate. If America wants to deploy carriers to protect Taiwan, they will
soon need to find a way to make them invisible. Otherwise, they are
billion dollar monuments to man’s innovative nature.

Of course, these innovations that are neutralizing the strengths of
great power militaries are not new. The grinding deadlock of the Great
War was due, in part, to the ability of all sides to neutralize
offensive weapons, other than artillery. Both sides were left to pound
one another from extensive trench systems. In this age, it means both
sides are left with stand-off systems like missiles. It also makes the
use of nuclear weapons more attractive as a way to break the deadlock.

This being the modern age, the trenches will be virtual. America
launched the equivalent of a race to the sea by breaking all promises
and declaring financial war on the Russian economy. The Russians have
responded but have yet to launch their best financial weapons. China and
India are now joining the fight, America has announced sanctions on
China in response. Instead of trench war, this century’s great war will
mean barriers to trade and capital.

Instead of reducing Europe to a moonscape, it will bring about a global
depression that will set off unknown consequences. The world will have a
food shortage this year due to the halt of agricultural products from
Russia. Energy prices are rising, which will amplify the inflation
pressure. Like the Great War, we are about to enter a test of wills
where all sides try to bring the other to the breaking point
economically. Washington is betting you can starve longer than Russians
or Chinese.
