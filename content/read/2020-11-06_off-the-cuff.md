Elections in America have become like a troublesome employee, who is
never content to just do the job. Instead she is always creating drama,
where none should exist, so that everyone has to stop what they are
doing and tend to her drama. Things that should be mundane tasks
inevitably become long drawn out affairs where trivial issues require
meetings and discussion. While the work eventually gets done, everyone
is exhausted by having to deal with the drama queen.

An election should be a simple affair. Eligible voters go to the voting
place, verify that they are the person they claim, cast their lot and
those lots are counted. American elections are first past the post,
meaning the most votes win, so it is not as if we have complex
apportionment issues to resolve. Despite the simplicity of the task, our
elections have now become pointless drama that ropes in the public, like
the story of little Timmy falling down the well. It’s exhausting.

America is a joke country now, well past the point of reform, but if one
is looking for something that could be reformed, elections are a good
start. A simple change could eliminate most of this drama. Jurisdictions
have 12 hours to count their votes or the election is void. The
incumbents get another term. In the case of House and Senate seats, the
state loses that seat for the term. Right now Pennsylvania would be
facing two years with no House members.

Of course, no such rule could be implemented. America is no longer able
to patch potholes in roads or keep the schools functioning, so
implementing even modest reform is well beyond the capacity of the
kleptocrats. That means we are left with the drama that will surely get
worse with each election. The only alternative is to tune it out and
leave the drama to the drama queens. In fact, the right answer going
forward is to just stop voting entirely. The votes don’t count anyway.

Just as feeding into the high drama employee validates her drama,
participating in elections now validates the corruption. When the crooks
rig the election, they plausibly claim that it was the will of the
people. After all, the people were dumb enough to participate in the
charade. They must like it. If in the next election, turnout is 30% and
the Democrats win with 110% of the vote in Michigan, even the crooks
will have to acknowledge that the whole thing is just a ridiculous sham.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
