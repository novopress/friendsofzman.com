For a very long time, science has thought that humans first evolved in
sub-Saharan Africa and then spread throughout the world. The main reason
for this is that the oldest human-like fossils have been found in
Africa. Everywhere else, the oldest fossils are Neanderthal or modern
humans. There are exceptions, like *homo floresiensis*, found in
Indonesia. This is the one they called the “hobbit” because it was so
small. This is believed to be an archaic human that migrated out of
Africa 2 million years ago.

That’s the dominant narrative for how humans came to populate just about
every nook and cranny of the earth. Recent genetic studies go a long way
toward confirming the flow of humans around the world. It’s not “settled
science”, if such a thing could exist, but it is the foundation from
which scientists works when examining the fossil record. <a

the first instinct is to figure out how it fits into the current model,

In science, this is what is called a  “big deal.” At the very minimum,
it could force a re-evaluation of the timeline for human migration out
of Africa. It could also mean that humans moved out of Africa, evolved
into what we think of as modern humans and then migrated back to Africa.
Later, these early humans then made the trip back out to the rest of the
world. At the very minimum, it could lead to a rethinking of the basic
narrative, which will set off huge fights within the scientific
community for many reasons.

The main reason is the oldest – ego. Many careers have been built around
the assumption that modern humans first evolved in Africa and then
migrated out to the rest of the world fairly recently. Naturally, when
the work of a lifetime is challenged by new evidence, the instinct is to
dispute it. Scientists have all the same vices as the rest of us. In
fact, smart people tend to be even more petty and envious than most. The
most likely result will be an attempt to dismiss these new finds or
discredit them in some way.

While all of that is very preliminary, this find does introduce, or
re-introduce, an idea that modern science would like to exclude. That
is, human evolution not only continued after humans left Africa, but
that it accelerated. As humans migrated into new areas, they quickly
adapted to those areas, both physically and cognitively. This process
continued on just as it does with all species. Put another way, human
evolution was *copious, local and recent* and the result is measurable
differences between groups of humans.

That, of course, brings us back to the bogeyman that haunts the dreams
of modern intellectuals, which is the bogeyman of race. Just as
anthropologists will seek to dismiss data that contradicts the standard
model of human migration, modern intellectuals are always on the lookout
for anything that contradicts the egalitarian narrative. Most of Western
public policy is built on the premise that all people are the same and
that any measurable differences are the result of white racism. Nature
plays no role.

It is mistakenly assumed that the viciousness with which the Progs
attack anyone questioning multiculturalism is purely about power.
There’s some of that, but the real driver is belief. How they define the
world, and how they define themselves, is based on the bedrock
assumptions of the blank slate. If those assumptions are invalidated,
not only is their worldview invalid, but they are invalid. Human
bio-diversity is the same as telling a devout Muslim that Mohamed was a
Jewish comedian and Islam is an elaborate gag.

This discovery will most likely be memory-holed or recast in some way as
to not threaten the narrative. The most likely result is everyone just
ignores it. But, genetics is making a long march through the human
sciences and <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that’s not something</a> that
can be ignored for too much longer. Soon, we reach a Galileo moment when
the orthodoxy either shuts down the human sciences or the orthodoxy
begins to crumble. That’s ultimately what happened in Christendom. The
Church gave way to science in public affairs.

Before anyone gets too excited by the prospect of scientific racism
smashing the prevailing orthodoxy, it is important to remember that the
Church gave ground to science slowly and violently. The Thirty Years
War, for example, left much of central Europe devastated. Towns were
depopulated, villages were wiped off the map and people were reduced to
cannibalism. The so-called Age of Reason was a bloody mess featuring one
more violent war after another. Things tend to end poorly and this
will not end well.
