From time to time, I have been checking in on
<a href="http://freenortherner.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this
blog</a>, which I’m led to believe is a popular neo-reaction site.
<a href="http://neorxn.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This
site</a>, from what I gather, is a clearing house of some sort for what
is lumped into the NRx bucket. I have not followed the neo-reaction
thing closely for a while, but I try to pay attention to it.

I can’t say I was ever a big fan. That’s not to say I’m against it. I
just don’t have strong opinions about any of it. I’m not even sure “it”
is a thing or just a catch-all term for opinion that does not fit the
popular templates. Put another way, anyone who thinks egalitarianism is
ridiculous and is not all that concerned about being called a heretic,
gets lumped into the neo-reactionary bucket.

Years ago I found  [Mencius
Moldbug](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/moldbugs-gentle-introduction/)
and decided his thing was probably not for me. The main reason is I am
not sitting around reading 16,000 word blog posts. I’ve been doing this
internet thing in one fashion or another since the 80’s and I’m not
easily impressed. In the early days there were a lot of young males
thinking they were going to change the world. They’re old men now and
the world has not changed. That and I’m not much of a joiner.

I’ve written before that there’s a Dungeons and Dragons quality to a lot
of it. Maybe it is the endless fascination with the return of monarchy
that has me thinking that many of these guys watch Game of Thrones
dressed as their favorite character. Maybe it’s that there’s so much
overlap with the Vox Day world. I don’t know, but
<a href="http://nickbsteves.wordpress.com/the-reactionary-oath/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stuff like this</a> is so common with the
self-professed neo-reactionary types I think I’m on the right track with
the D&D angle.

Recently, there’s been some sort of disruption in the NRx universe. I
don’t know enough about it to comment on the particulars, but it appears
that they had formed some sort of little club or secret society and now
<a
href="http://www.hestiasociety.org/site/about/official-statement-on-the-leadership-of-nrx/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">there is a power struggle within that
club</a>. Free Northerner
<a href="http://freenortherner.com/2015/05/24/authority/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">reports on it here</a> and Nick Land
<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/putsch/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">comments on it here</a>. I have no idea what any of it
means, but there it is.

Steve Sailer often points out that fringe movements are often cluttered
with misfits and weirdos. The reason is these people have no home in
more stable movements so they are available for recruitment by the new
thing. There’s also the fact that new mass movements are by their nature
opposed to the orthodox and mainstream. That means they are the natural
home to the unorthodox and the strange. Some of those people will be
crazy.

That’s probably why I’m getting a Judean People’s Front –  People’s
Front of Judea vibe reading about whatever it is that’s going on with
these people. Inside these movements, the issues loom large, dominating
the minds of the participants. Outside the movement these fights seem
weird and comical in their triviality. It’s like watching ants fight
over a crumb. Entertaining, but wholly unimportant.

The funny thing is the great wave about to sweep over social science and
therefore political science is biological realism, driven by genetics
and processing power.Technology is cracking open the secrets of human
biology and big data is casting a light on the dark corners of social
behavior. This should be a the salad days for a philosophical movement
that rejects the Standard Social Science Model.

As I said at the start of this post, I don’t follow it closely enough to
understand the details of their struggles. My guess is they are running
into the problem that all fringe movements face and that’s a lack of
agreement over most everything, other than enemy. They all agree that
multiculturalism and globalism are unworkable, but that’s where the
agreement ends. Building a coherent philosophy from that is impossible.

That’s the challenge that awaits biological realism. The kabbalistic new
faith that has emerged around the principles of egalitarianism,
anti-racism and multiculturalism may be irrational and at odds with
observable reality, but it fills the spiritual void of the ruling
classes. You don’t defeat a spiritual movement with facts and reason.
You offer an alternative.

Maybe that’s why obscurantism is so common amongst NRx bloggers. Moldbug
was maddeningly long winded and often incoherent. He invested a lot of
his time in creating an aesthetic, rather than making points. Like the
Beats and their clove cigarettes, NRx spends a lot of time signalling to
one another. It is the sense of belonging that makes them tick, not the
intellectual rigor of their arguments. It’s church for dorks.
