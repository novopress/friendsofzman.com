Regardless of how you feel about Obama’s politics, you have to admit
that the people behind him are very good at selling their man to the
public. Their get out the vote efforts have run circles around the GOP.
They created a voting block out of single women. The “Julia” campaign
may have seemed creepy to a lot of normal people, but it worked on the
target audience. The young gals changed two elections based on their
belief that the GOP wants to pack their uterus with bibles and sew up
their vaginas.

This add appears to be targeting homosexual males.

Lots of people on the Right are howling with laughter at this add, but
it would be wise to consider the possibility that it is a good marketing
campaign. After all, the people behind it have put a man in the White
House based on their ability to target the aspirations of Progressive
white women and black church ladies. In 2004, the idea of a mixed race
guy with a Muslim name becoming was as laughable as this advertisement.

This fruit looks a lot like the actor from Big Bang Theory. That is a
very popular TV sit-com featuring nerdish beta males, replaying the
Friends show of the 1990’s. It’s popular for a reason. Look around at
the stars popular with youth and you will not find a lot of tough guys
facing off against the bad guys. It is almost exclusively sexually
ambiguous males and masculinized females. Body spray makes millions for
chemical companies because millions of young American males want to
smell like a woman.
