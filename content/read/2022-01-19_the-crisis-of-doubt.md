A basic requirement of every human society is that it must have a set of
rules that define the society and the people in it. It is this shared
understanding of what defines the society that keeps the thing together.
“Who we are” is defined by “what we do” and it is the commonsense of the
people. People living in a monarchy take the king and the nobility for
granted. To question the legitimacy of the king is to question the very
nature of society and the rules that define it.

In modern America, the experts who run the country have become one of
these fixed things that everyone accepts. For example, the head of the
Federal Reserve runs the banking system and controls the money supply.
Since Alan Greenspan made the job famous, Americans have just accepted
that the person in this job is responsible for keeping the economy from
danger. He does not set taxes or control spending, but he makes sure the
economy avoids catastrophe.

This general assumption is not without merit. It was the Federal Reserve
that pulled the country out of stagflation in the 1980’s. They kept the
Savings & Loan crisis from creating a bank run. In the 1990’s, they
organized the bailout of Long Term Capital Management and then navigated
the Dot-Com bust. They came to the rescue of the global economy in the
mortgage crisis. So far, they have managed to prevent the Covid panic
from cratering the economy.

There is a lot one can quibble with in that list and many will say that
those crises were the fault of the bankers, including the Fed. To most
people though, the mysterious group of people who run the economy are
one thing you can trust. Even though trust in government at all levels
has declined sharply over the last few decades, the Federal Reserve
remains the most trusted institution. Most years, the Fed chairman has
better approval than the president.

In a world where people assume there is an answer to every problem and
an expert able to find the answer, there is an assumption that whatever
problems crop up, the people in charge will find the solution. This is
what makes managerialism both possible and tolerable. If the experts
keep getting things wrong, what is the point of having a society run by
experts? People put up with the metastasizing set of rules because there
is a general trust that there is logic behind them.

This trust in experts is not new. It has been a defining characteristic
of American society since at least the 19th century. Taylorism was the
attempt to use science to improve management of companies in the 1880’s.
That gave birth to the Efficiency Movement, which sought to apply
engineering principles to social policy. What we think of as the Left in
America grew out of this belief that social reform could be achieved by
experts changing the rules of society to achieve the desired outcome.

The fact is the strength of the American system over the last century
has been this faith in the experts to find the right answer. When things
go wrong, the current experts are fired and new experts are brought in
to solve the problem. Elections have been an indirect review of the
experts class. If the people are not happy, they vote for the other
party who come in with new experts. If things go well, then the party is
rewarded with a good election the next time.

That is what makes the current crisis so serious. Most people think the
experts badly bungled the Covid problem. The experts said we had two
weeks to bend the curve and two years into it the curve is not bent. The
vaccine was supposed to be the great triumph of science and technology
and it is looking like it is not only not working but possibly a billion
dollar boondoggle. The last two years have been a massive blow to the
credibility of science in modern America.

Then you have the economic troubles. Most people assumed there would be
some trouble from the Covid panic. You cannot close down the economy for
months and not have consequences. Unlike those prior economic crises,
the Fed is not skillfully navigating this one. Empty shelves and
spirally prices are not what people expect from the expert class. Things
that could be acquired in days now take months because the supply chain
is a chaotic mess.

The deeper problem is the old habit of just voting for the out-party
when things are not doing well has not been working either. People voted
for Obama to close the books on the history of race. Instead, race
relations got sharply worse. Obama was supposed to end the forever wars
and he expanded them. Trump was the shot across the bow by the people
and the system responded with a four year tantrum. Biden was supposed to
be the return to normal and we have chaos instead.

This is why 70% of Americans think the country is in a <a
href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/seven-ten-americans-say-country-crisis-risk-failing"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">serious crisis</a>. They are not puzzling
it out like this, but they just sense that the system has broken and
there is no one around with an understanding of how to fix it. One of
the paradoxes of the current age is the people in charge say we are in
the middle of a crisis, but then wage jihad against anyone proposing a
way out of the crisis. Their solution to “save democracy” is to
eliminate any trace of it from society.

The core of the current crisis is that no one can honestly answer the
question that is the basis of all human organization, who are we? It is
no longer easy to say what it means to be an American. The commonsense
that are the rules of society are no longer making sense, which calls
into question the basics of society. We used to be a people who assumed
the experts would eventually get it right. Now we are a people wondering
if there is such a thing as experts at all.
