I recorded the show on Wednesday evening, so I could not comment on the
Kanye West appearance on the Alex Jones show. Editing the show last
night, after having watched a bit of the circus and the aftermath, it
occurred to me that what we are seeing is the imagination of Andrew
Anglin come to life. West is a weird post-modern Pinocchio that exists
to lampoon the pieties of the current age.

For those who did not see it, West was on the Alex Jones show with Nick
Fuentes to make a big scene. West showed up dressed as a ghetto
Spiderman. He was wearing what looked like a varsity jacket, if the
varsity was gay prison gang, along with a black gimp mask that had no
openings for his eyes or mouth. He also brought a tiny net that you
would use to fetch fish from an aquarium.

In the course of the show, West tried to promote Hitler as a
misunderstood character, wrongly slandered by the Jews. Alex Jones tried
hard to keep the show on the topic of censorship, but West would have
none of it. Laura Loomer was brought on to talk about herself and one of
Sammy Davis Jr’s grandchildren spoke for some reason. Fuentes was a
minor player in this theater of the absurd.

Since this started, I have struggled to make sense of it, as the whole
thing is an eleven on my ridiculous meter. It is impossible to take
seriously a man who thinks it is a good idea to do a TV interviewed
dressed as ghetto Spiderman. Add in the fact that he is playing the
<a href="https://youtu.be/BLNDqxrUUwQ" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Clayton Bigsby</a> character from that old Dave Chappell
sketch, but taking the role seriously, and we are in a strange place.

The question that matters here is who benefits from this? Freak shows
always have a short life and in time this will be forgotten. On the
other hand, those who lampoon current pieties with absurd exaggeration
can stick around, but eventually their target gets tired of the jester
and has him thrown off the tower. Andrew Anglin has been ignored into
extinction by the people he used to mock.

On the other, other hand, this freak show is just the next step in the
decline of our politics into the absurd. Is a black hip-hop Nazi any
more ridiculous than a brain damaged hobo in the Senate? Maxine Waters
is now a respected figure in Washington, so how absurd is it to imagine
Kanye West as the new David Duke? This freak show is just the next
logical step in the decline of politics.

That said, mockery and satire work as political weapons when there is a
serious message baked into the mockery and satire. It is hard to find
the serious message in any of this, other than maybe it was a bad idea
to elevate hip-hop culture, but that was obvious since the Sugar Hill
Gang came on the scene. Otherwise, this stuff just looks like weird for
the sake of being weird.
