Being a nerd has become the cool kid thing to be. The media people in
Washington now call their big gala the “nerd ball” because it attracted
all of the policy wonks. The fact that few of these people can do basic
mathematics does not matter. They wear the right costumes and strike the
right pose so they can pretend to be bookish nerds. Every  liberal
pretends to be a science fan, even though none of them have any
background in science, especially the human sciences.

But, fads are what they are and no group is more faddish than the Left.
The trouble with this one is that incredibly stupid ideas get passed
around like settled science, to use a common refrain. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s a good example</a> from
Tech Crunch, a site that caters to the fake nerd crowd.

*Here’s an idea crazy enough that it just might work: Pave the streets
with solar-powered panels that have their own built-in heat and LED
lights. That’s what <a href="http://www.solarroadways.com/about.shtml"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott and Julie Brusaw</a>
hope to accomplish with their ongoing
<a href="http://www.solarroadways.com/intro.shtml"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solar Roadways</a> project,
which they just funded through a hugely popular crowdfunding campaign.*

*The husband-and-wife team has spent the better part of the last decade
developing solar-powered modular panels that could be installed in
roadways and parking lots, and would be able to collect power from the
sun. Those panels could also keep streets clear of snow and ice, while
illuminating them with LEDs.*

*Rather than paving streets and driveways with asphalt, the Solar
Roadways panels would theoretically be able to decrease our nation’s
dependence on fossil fuels by generating massive amounts of clean
energy. Panels are made from ruggedized glass and connect to one another
through a mesh network, so that even if one panel fails the system will
notify repair crews that it needs to be replaced.*

Actually, the theory is nonsense. Asphalt is black and that means it
absorbs sunlight readily. The light is converted into heat, which is why
the road is smoking hot in the middle of summer. It is also why the snow
melts away even when it is below freezing, once the road is exposed. The
road is converting close to 100% of the sunlight into heat. Solar
panels, on the other hand, convert about 15% of sunlight into
electricity. For that reason alone you have a huge loss of energy using
solar panels instead of asphalt.

Then you have the issue of storage. If you want to use solar to light
the roads, then you have to store the energy because lighting them in
the daytime is stupid. That means batteries. They have a loss of energy,
but they also cost a boatload of money and have to be replaced
regularly.

We’re not even at the hard parts. Building a road from solar panels
would require new materials capable of handling the massive abuse that
comes from being driven over by trucks and cars. Those materials could
not be smooth as the cars would fly off the roads in the rain.

Anyone with a mastery of basic science would spot this as nonsense, but
the fake nerd trend means these people get to con a bunch of fake nerds
into “crowdfunding” their alchemy. There’s always good money in
pretending to be the smartest guy in the room.
