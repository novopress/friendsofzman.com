If one were looking for a reason for why the conservative movement
failed so completely you would be spoiled for choice. Most people would
point to the fact that despite having billions of dollars and majority
support on key issues, conservatives managed to conserve nothing. Others
would point out that many of the people claiming to be conservative were
more concerned with maintaining good relations with their friends on the
Left than advancing conservative policy.

Often this is where you hear some form of the Hoffer quote about great
causes becoming religions, corporations or rackets. It is a great
observations and certainly true, especially with regards to the
conservative movement. Any system that produces a sanctimonious
simpleton like David French has long since stopped being a serious
political movement. Most of conservatism is a racket, while the rest is
just a jobs program for philosophy majors.

While true, these are symptoms rather than causes. The real cause of
conservative failure was the race issue. Once they conceded the moral
high ground to the Left over the issue of race, the Right was forced to
embrace the blank slate and egalitarianism in order to make any sense of
it. You cannot agree that unequal results are immoral if you also claim
that Mother Nature does not distribute her gifts equally. You have deny
nature in order to embrace the moral claim.

Once conservatives accepted the starting premise of the Left, they
condemned themselves to forever embracing the Left’s conclusions. You
can see this in the fight of the antiwhite pogroms called CRT and DEI.
This recent National Review <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/12/why-conservatives-lose-the-race-debate-and-how-we-can-win-it/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> claims that conservatives can
win the race debate. That sounds good until you read the actual text of
the post and see that the secret formula for winning is another version
of the internet meme, “the conservative case for…”

Here are the key lines. “We must see racial disparities where they exist
and acknowledge racial trauma as real, because for many Americans, *it
is real*. Responding to the trauma of racial discrimination by simply
expressing a commitment to a race-neutral ideal is a bad move.” In other
words, the so-called conservatives have to accept the premise of the
Left. They see winning as proving to their masters on the Left that they
are properly trained on the issue of race.

Now, the author of the piece is an interesting
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacwillour/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">character</a>. We can be sure that his ancestors did not
arrive on the Mayflower. He is an example of what conservatives tell us
is the new model American. His people arrived recently and as if by
magic they are not only as American as everyone else, but they now have
a duty to criticize the errors of your ancestors and explain how you can
make things right. South Asians have embraced the skins game with a
passion.

There is another name for this. Isaac Willour is a fine example of the
Ingrate-American, a new arrival who does nothing but lecture white
people for not having done enough to make his stay comfortable. White
Americans could be forgiven for wondering why in the hell they need to
listen to this interloper about anything. Maybe instead of lecturing us
about our ancestors, he should be thanking us for a life that the
civilization of his ancestors could never provide to him.

Putting that aside, once you concede that racial disparities require
your attention and that they are the fault of white people, you sign
onto whatever pogroms the Left launches on white people. There can be no
salvation for white people until those disparities are gone, but since
that is an impossibility, the only choice left is a forever war on
whiteness, which is a war on white people. This is the logical end of
the conservative embrace of the blank slate.

One you concede that people are amorphous blobs that can be made into
anything, the cause of observable disparity shifts from the individual
to society. Once you buy into the idea that all men are created equal,
you concede that any observed inequality must be the result of some
malevolent force in society. Once conservatives signed onto these two
concepts, they committed themselves to a war on the majority population
in the name of equality, equity and justice.

This is how conservatives went from Bill Buckley
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tek9h3a5wQ" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">arguing</a> with James Baldwin over the issue of civil
rights to a world where recent arrivals lecture the white population
about the crimes of their ancestors. After all, if all you have is the
claim that all men are created equal, endowed with natural rights, what
argument can you have against some guy getting off his flying carpet and
claiming to be your equal? As your equal, does he not have the right to
judge you and your ancestors?

Of course, this degenerate thinking pollutes everything. After all, how
can one oppose open borders when you owe such a huge debt to the world?
How can one question the economic arrangements when the world is
counting on your sacrifice? How can you oppose community wrecking
policies when you wanting to live a peaceful life among people like
yourself is clearly white supremacy? Once the blood libel gets going, it
becomes the universal weapon.

This is why conservatism has been a failure in America. Once they signed
off on the blank slate and egalitarianism, they had no way to dispute
any of the claims made by the Left, so they were reduced to being their
unwilling accomplices. Eventually, their masters lost patience and now
conservatives compete with one another to see who can be the most
enthusiastic for the latest progressive fad. Conservatism is a shadow
that cheers as the Left flits from one cause to the next.
