People who follow French politics are talking about the upcoming run-off
between Macron and Le Pen as a possible replay of 1981. In that
election, François Mitterrand scored a stunning upset of incumbent
president, Valery Giscard d’Estaing, to become the first socialist to
win since the Second World War. Mitterrand ushered in a new era of
French politics that prevails to this day. It is a cynical, divide and
conquer politics that serves a narrow elite at the expense of the
nation.

Like Americans, the French have been facing the problem that elections
seem to have no bearing on public policy. They vote in new people and
new parties, but the polices never seem to change. Macron has not been
much different from Hollande, who was not much different from Sarkozy.
In fact, each French president since Mitterrand has followed a
predictable internationalist course. As a result, France has been
swamped by immigrants and looted by international finance.

It is a good reminder that elections in a democracy have consequences,
but rarely in the way people expect. Mitterrand’s upset victory ushered
in a new brand of politics that every ambitious French pol seeks to
emulate. Something similar happened in the United States in the 1992
presidential election. Bill Clinton represented a new generation of
political leadership. He ushered in a new form of politics that infected
both parties and the political mechanism upon which they rely.

Like in France, American politics is deeply cynical now. Elections are
viewed with disdain by the politicians. It is something they must endure
so they can get on with what they view as the important parts of
politics. The important part of politics is advancing an agenda that
serves the narrow interests of the managerial elite. This is why
elections have no bearing on public policy. The office holders may
change and the parties may swap positions, but the elites never change.

That is the source of the growing hostility the political classes of the
West have for the people they theoretically represent. Macron is a prime
example. He is in trouble politically because he carries himself like a
man who is doing the French people a favor by paying attention to them.
Not long ago he said that you are not French if you do not follow his
rules with regards to Covid. He joked about using the administrative
state to torment those who question his policies.

There is that cynicism at the heart of politics in the modern West. No
serious leader thinks such things, much less says them out loud, if he
has any regard for the people he claims to lead. More important, no
serious leader acts this way if he thinks the opinions of the voters
matter. When the game is rigged, or at least seems that it is rigged,
then it no longer makes much sense to pretend public opinion matters.
This is the truth of the cynical politics of the modern West.

In America, this is most evident in the concept of messaging. In modern
American political jargon, messaging is a form of crowd control. The
crowd is the mass media, which takes its cues from the inner party. The
e-mails go out, the spokesmen give pressers and this is what shapes the
daily narrative in the press. This is then supposed to herd the public
in the direction of the official policy. Good polls confirm to the
political class that their messaging is working.

An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNBvUq8e2Ko&amp;t=8s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a> is from the chief messenger,
Jen Psaki. Note that she struggles to read the catch phrase of the day.
It turns out that saying “Putin price hike” out loud sounds rather silly
and childish, even to someone without a soul. The expectation is the
official media organs will use the phrase while reporting on the
inflation numbers and the general narrative will be that the cause of
inflation is Putin. The Democrats probably plan to campaign on the
slogan “Putin price hike” this fall.

Think about the cynicism on display. Psaki knows what she is saying is a
lie and everyone in the room knows it is a lie. Further, she knows that
no one thinks what she is saying is anything but a lie. The
stenographers in the press pool know that she knows that they know she
is lying. When they work on the official narrative at their respective
media organs, they will know they are participating in the lie. In other
words, everyone knows everyone is lying but they keep lying.

This is only possible in a deeply cynical system populated with people
motivated by malice toward the public. The people running the global
economic war resent that they have to pretend to care about public
opinion. They can barely contain their loathing for the people outside
the castle walls. Shark-eyed dingbats like Jen Psaki exist because she
is actually what passes for a friendly face in this system. Even she can
barely conceal her contempt for the public she is addressing.

French political observers suspect this election is signaling the end of
the cynical politics ushered in by François Mitterrand. Cynicism is an
effective short term strategy in politics, but it eventually runs into
the Lincoln limit. That is the old line about fooling all of the people
all of the time that is attributed to Lincoln. It was also a popular
advertising slogan in the 19th century. This is appropriate given that
the cynical politics of this age is basically just a sales campaign
organized by fraudsters.

In America, we may be seeing similar signals. The cynical politics of
the Clinton machine gave as a degenerate (Clinton), a simpleton (Bush)
and a vacuous airhead (Obama) as president, all with the claim that they
were accomplished men. If not for Trump the fourth in that series would
have been the wife of the degenerate. Now we are being sold a mumbling
vegetable as the most popular man in history. Joe Biden may be the limit
of the cynical post-Cold War politics.
