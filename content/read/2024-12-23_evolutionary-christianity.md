One of the most important dates on the Christian calendar is Christmas,
the day set aside to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. There is a
1-in-365 chance that Jesus was born on December 25, but no one knows
when Jesus was born. The date is of no great significance to the life of
Christ. What matters is he was lived and died, and his life and death
are the root of the world’s most important religion. To Christians, the
life of Jesus is the most important event in human history.

Whether Christianity is still the most important world religion is the
most important part of that first paragraph, given the state of
Christianity in the world. In Europe, where Christianity evolved and
flourished in the Roman empire, Christianity is no longer an important
part of the culture. The trappings of Christmas remain, largely for
commercial reasons, but otherwise Christianity is just about gone. Islam
and managerial liberalism are the most important religions in Europe.

In the United States, Christianity remains under assault by the usual
suspects but remains an important part of the culture. Even in the
secular regions, the cultural framework of Christianity remains in
place. God has been replaced by “the tides of history” and Scripture
with the latest slop from progressivism, but these things are just
filling the hole left in the Christian framework. In the more normal
parts of the country, Christian churches still dot the countryside.

There is no question that Christianity is on the wane in the Western
world and that spells trouble for the Church globally. It is tempting to
wonder if Christianity has a future at all, but the better question is
what will it become in the future? The story of Christianity is survival
and evolution. What we think of as Christianity today is nothing like
what the early Christians experienced. Even medieval Christians would
find modern Christianity to be weird and heretical.

For example, early Christians would be puzzled by the reliance on
Scripture by many modern Protestant sects. The Gospels were not written
until roughly a century after the life of Christ and his disciples. The
first “Bible” was assembled by St. Jerome around A.D. 400 and included
27 books of the New Testament. In 382 A.D., the Council of Rome finished
the process of determining the 73 books of the Bible. There were
probably millions of Christians before there was a single Bible.

Then you have the fact that the Christianity that emerged from the
Levant and began to spread around the Roman Empire ran into both Roman
paganisms, but also the much more potent paganism of the Germanic
barbarians. Many of the things we associate with Christianity were
borrowed from these pagans. James C. Russell argues in his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Germanization-Early-Medieval-Christianity-Sociohistorical/dp/0195104668"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>, *The Germanization of Early
Medieval Christianity*, that the culture and religion of Germanic pagans
shaped Christianity.

Of course, there are “Bible believing Christians” who reject these
claims, but these people are practicing a form of Christianity that
could not exist if not for the evolution of the Church into the late
Middle Ages. It was the revolution within Christianity that gave us
Protestantism and to some degree its secular partner liberalism. The
dynamic between the two is a hot topic today in dissident circles. There
would be no “Bible believing Christians” without this evolutionary
process.

This evolution of Christianity also helps explain why it survived at
all. A handful of radical Jews changed the course of human history, by
creating something that has motivated men to die for their belief in it.
In 303, the Roman emperor Diocletian issued a series of edicts
rescinding Christians’ legal rights, setting off a decade of
persecutions, just as the early Christian were beginning to codify their
faith. Despite this, the Church not only survived, but became much
stronger.

There is a good argument to be made that the success of Christianity was
due to its struggle in the face of persecution. Early Christians had to
be smart, courageous, and resourceful to maintain their religion. This
selected for the sorts of people who were willing to take on the
enormous challenge of maintaining, spreading, and developing a
fundamentally new moral and cosmological outlook. The early Christians
had to be to the far right of the bell curve.

Another way to think of it is that Christianity was a new mind virus
that quickly evolved to spread among its new host. It then had to evolve
even faster once it broke out of its original population. When efforts
to eradicate it came, it once again evolved rapidly to adapt to the
changes in its host population. Like the common cold or the flu, there
are lots of variant of the original Christian virus now. In the end,
they all promise the same thing for those infected.

Still another evolutionary way of thinking about how Christianity
survived and thrived is that it is a mutation in human thought. Until
Christianity, monotheism was limited to Jews and Zoroastrians.
Universalism did not exist. These two mutations combined in Christianity
and spread through the life, struggle, and death of early Christians
until it became a dominant trait. The irony here is that some Christians
dispute evolution, but they would not be here if evolution were not
real.

The point of all this is not to rustle the sensibilities of those
Christians who think the reason for the Church is it is the will and
word of God. The point is that Christianity exists at all because it has
adapted and survived far worse that the commercialization of Christmas
and the “happy holidays” nonsense. Christianity is facing a new
challenge in the West, one to which it will have to adapt, while
maintaining the thing that has allowed it to survive, which is the hope
and courage it provides the believer.

The reason the West is in crisis is the new religion, that which the
managerial class struggles to understand, even while they are preaching
it, is not able to provide an answer to the questions Christianity has
always been able to answer. Those questions are “Who says?” and “Why
should I listen?” Men will live and die in defense of the answers to
those questions. Whatever Christianity becomes on the surface, it will
thrive because it answers the most important of man’s questions.
