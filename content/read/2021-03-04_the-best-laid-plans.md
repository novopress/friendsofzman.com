Anyone who has had to plan a project or organize an event knows that the
plans never turn out as expected. Even the most cynical veterans know
their plans will run into some unexpected snafu. In fact, the word
“snafu” comes from the people who spend most of the time planning
things, the military. The word “snafu” comes from the acronym
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAFU" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">SNAFU</a>, which was popularized during the Second World
War. It is why we have another military saying. “No plan survives
contact with the enemy.”

This may be what we are about to witness with The Pretender. The people
who rigged the election knew Biden was unlikely to last his entire term.
He is an old man in poor health and the White House is not the place for
an octogenarian. He would either drop dead, become incapacitated or,
most likely, lose his marbles so bad that he would have to be removed.
This is why <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/politics/house-oversight-commission-president-health/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pelosi</a> pushed a bill to form a 25th
Amendment commission in the fall of last year. She was planning ahead.

The thing is though, the plan was for Biden to be well enough to sign
off on whatever the Democrats could rush through the House and Senate.
The rhythm of politics is the first year of a new administration is when
things can get done. The people inside the Green Zone believe the public
is as happy as they are to be rid of Trump, so they want to push through
all of their schemes as fast as possible. It is why the people who
really run things have had Biden sign close to 50 executive order.

They also need Biden to help sell these schemes. This was the lesson of
Obama’s first term when Congress deadlocked on health care. Obama sat on
the sidelines letting Pelosi run the show. The project quickly went
sideways, took forever to get done and the result was an embarrassing
mess. We are seeing the same thing with Biden, who is <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/03/03/wh-cuts-feed-joe-biden-asks-questions/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">quickly becoming a vegetable</a>. The
White House is now forced to spend most of their time hiding this guy
from the public because of his dementia.

Most people think the plan was to nurse Biden along for a couple of
years, then use year three to remove him from office. The more cynical
thought the plan was to dump him after the election and install Harris.
It is hard to know, but the people around Biden seem determined to keep
their man upright for as long as possible. So far, the media is going
along with the scheme to shield the truth of Biden’s condition from the
public, but how long the White House staff can keep this going is hard
to know.

Of course, it is also possible that no one thought much about what
happens after installing a dementia patient in the White House. They
just hated Trump so much they did not care if Biden was a corpse. They
are <a
href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/democrats-want-biden-relinquish-sole-authority-nuclear-launches"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">starting to think about it</a> now though
and that is going to be the story here in the coming months. If Biden’s
own party no longer trusts him with the basics of his office, it will
not be long before they start noticing that he is basically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Max Headroom</a> presidency now.

The other part of the plan is also going sideways. The plan said that
once Trump was gone, he was gone for good. The people would hold a
triumph for the those who vanquished the monster and the monster would
be gone. It turns out that the Left needed him more than he needed them.
To continue the analogy, they continue to carry the corpse of Trump
around, pretending it is still alive. Given the people involved, it is
more than a bit ironic that they did not learn from
<a href="https://youtu.be/_ZMuOhuB3Wo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Kritzinger’s story</a>.

That’s another problem with the plan. It was always better to have Trump
inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. Trump is a
gifted shit-talker. It is what got him the nomination. Now he gets to be
the shadow president, mocking and jeering the Biden administration and
his old enemies in the tent. Trump was not very good at being president,
but he will be very good at mocking Biden’s mental decline. That will
make it page one news going forward.

None of this should be a surprise. The people in the Green Zone are
gifted schemers with a vermin-like rapacity. They live to undermine the
rules and subvert the natural order, but they have never been very good
at running things. They are not very good at thinking about downstream
consequences. The fact that their grand plan to “restore our democracy”
has sprung so many leaks is hardly a surprise. It’s why they are
obsessed with the <a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/02/capitol-police-qanon-march-4-theory-claims-trump-president/6894882002/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">ridiculous Q hoax</a>.

The lesson here is that politics is never about planning. It is about
opportunity. This is true regardless of the political system. Politics
is about human behavior and people are too irrational to fit into a
plan. Good politics is always being prepared to take a bite out of the
other side and boost your side. Sometimes, that means working with
people you hate, which is what the Democrats should have done with
Trump. It is a lesson dissidents should keep in mind as the Biden story
unfolds this summer.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
