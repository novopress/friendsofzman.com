I’m back to the shotgun format for this week. The single issue format
got a lot of good feedback, so I think I’ll do more of those. I have to
think of some topics first, to make sure it is sustainable, but I’m
confident that will not be a problem. Last week was one of the most
downloaded issues I’ve done. Anything that has race in it gets a lot of
traffic. That says a lot about the audience, but it says a lot of about
our age too. Race is real.

For this episode, I’m back to a cornucopia of unrelated items I saw this
week. I thought about doing a show around the upcoming libertarian
convention, but I think an hour of sperg-bashing would be gratuitous, so
I have just one segment on it. If there is a common thread to this
week’s show, it is that the gap between Left and Right is growing. It
really does feel like the public is coming to the realization that it is
time for a divorce.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
