**Note:** This being the time of year when people feel generous, you may
be thinking about sending a few bucks to a worthy cause. If you are an
HBD fan or a supporter of academic integrity, you should consider
kicking in a few bucks to the Bryan Pesta fundraiser that you can learn

Michael Kinsley famously said that a political gaffe is “when a
politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn’t supposed to
say.” The important part of that quip is that the truth is obvious but
everyone pretends otherwise. The word for it is
[mokita](https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=4458), which means things we
know are true but agree to never discuss. It is not really an agreement,
but more of a convention that is enforced from the top down. Every once
in a while, someone with power screws up and speak the truth.

That is what you see with this recent Dennis Prager <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/06/if-holocaust-deniers-dont-go-to-hell-there-is-no-god/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">column</a>. He declared that anyone
questioning the current facts about the holocaust is evil. He
specifically singled out Nick Fuentes, who has been in the news because
of the Kanye West business. The two of them have been making the rounds,
with West saying uncharitable things about Jewish people and saying nice
things about Hitler. Fuentes has been mostly a bit player in the show,
as West is the headliner of Ye24.

Why Prager singled out Fuentes would be a good question to pose to him.
Kanye West is the guy praising Hitler. Milo Yiannopoulos was
instrumental in kicking off this traveling carnival, but Prager did not
mention him. Another player in this drama is a hip-hop performer named
Sneako. They recently added the weird internet gadfly Ali Alexander to
the performance. Fuentes is the only white Christian in the crew and not
the main player, yet Prager focuses on him.

Putting aside that bit of mask dropping, Prager has made himself rich
selling creedalism to the salt of the earth white people who make up his
audience. This is the claim that anyone can be an American as long as
they embrace American principles. If you accept the basics of the
American creed, then you are as American as a guy whose family came over
on the Mayflower. America is an idea, or a collection of ideas, rather
than a physical place for a specific people.

Lots of white people are flattered by this, but most people also notice
that the people peddling this idea tend to take Saturday off. It is not
a coincidence that this new definition of American has no benefit to
white Christians but is a huge bonus to mercurial people from outside
the European Christian tradition. Prager is one of the leading advocates
“America is a set of ideas’ and most people understand why, even if they
politely ignore the elephant in the room.

One of those creedal ideas is freedom of expression. In fact, it is one
of the most cherished principles of American morality. The right to
speak one’s mind without fear of retribution is the cornerstone of the
republic. Not only do you get to say what you like, but others get to
hear you without fear of retribution. Free speech is established in the
first amendment to the Constitution because you cannot petition the
government for the redress of grievances if you need permission to
speak.

Until the last decade or so, “I may disagree with what you say but I
will fight to the death for your right to say it!” was a common refrain
from leftists. Most right-wing people knew that what lefty really wanted
was the right to send porn to your kids, but the civic principle was
worth the risk and the lecture. You cannot have self-government and a
civil society without the free exchange of ideas. More speech, even
stupid or obnoxious speech, is better than less speech.

It was not just sloganeering. In 1978, the ACLU defended a neo-Nazi
group that wanted to march through a Jewish neighborhood. There was no
question that the intent of the neo-Nazi group was to be offensive. They
picked the neighborhood for their march because it was full of Jews. The
ACLU successfully argued that even though the Nazis picked the
neighborhood because it was full of Jews, they still had a right to
speak their mind in public and the public had a right to hear them.

Foundational to American morality is that you are free to speak your
mind not because you have the right to speak, but because others have
the right to hear you. Shouting people down is explicitly un-American.
You let the person be heard and then you can be heard in response. This
is the exact opposite of what Dennis Prager is doing with regards to
people like Nick Fuentes. He wants Nick Fuentes to be silenced, so you
cannot hear what he has to say for himself.

Prager is careful to not call for the arrest and execution of Nick
Fuentes, but it is clear that he would not be offended by it. After all,
Prager declares that questioning the holocaust is the epitome of evil.
Those who do this, according to Prager, will spend eternity in Hell.
Given his cult’s ambiguity about the existence of Heaven and Hell, this
is a curious claim. It means that he wants you to believe that holocaust
deniers like Nick Fuentes are outside of *your* Christian mercy.

That is what makes the Prager column a massive gaffe. He is essentially
saying, “That civic nationalism stuff applies to you people, but my
people have other priorities and so we get to operate by separate
rules.” By elevating his Jewish identity over everything else, he
contradicts the entire civic nationalist argument. Again, this was
obvious to many people, but it largely went unsaid. By demanding
everyone submit to the myths and legends of his people, Prager is saying
it out loud.

The column itself is a remarkable example of Kinsley’s quip. The truth
is, in a majority-minority society like America, what matters is your
tribe. This is the truth that the people in charge are not supposed to
say. They get to be in charge as long as the biggest tribe does not
decide to tribe up. The minoritism that rules modern America only works
if white people buy into the creedalism stuff. Dennis Prager just told
his fans that creedalism is nonsense. It is tribe that matters most.
