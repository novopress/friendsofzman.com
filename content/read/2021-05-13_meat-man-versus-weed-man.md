Often, the natural confluence of events results in something so elegant
or complex that people see the hand of design behind the result. Even
though the odds of there being a secret conspiracy or master chess
player behind the result are very low, that just seems better than the
odds of chance getting the result. Most conspiracy theories rely on this
sort of logic. The official explanations seem so unlikely that they must
be part of some conspiracy to shield the truth from the public.

A good example of this is the last election. No sitting president has
seen a double digit increase in his vote, but still lose. In fact, no
one has been able to find an example like this in other elected offices.
That’s how rare it is. This once in forever thing could be accepted in
isolation, but it is just one of such things. There are so many
unexplained anomalies that people are naturally skeptical. The invisible
hand of design, even without hard proof, seems like the more likely
explanation.

We may be seeing something similar happen with food. All of a sudden, we
are being bombarded with agit-prop in favor of eating bugs and
plant-based proteins, rather than eating beef and chicken. Beef seems to
be the primary target, but that could simply be the result of the Left’s
long war against cows. The Left believes cows are part of a secret
conspiracy against Gaia to poison the atmosphere. The “cow fart”
conspiracy is as real to them as the ongoing Russian conspiracy.

A few years ago, the fast food chain Burger King introduced something
called an “impossible burger” which is made from grass clippings. The
claim was that it tasted just like their regular burgers but was made
from plants. Why they did this was never asked or explained. Up to that
point, the number of people saying, “Man, I could really go for a burger
made from grass clippings right now” was zero. In fact, the number
remains stubbornly pegged at zero. No one wants this.

Now, billion dollar companies make dumb decisions. History is full of
ideas cooked up in corporate offices that turn out to be laughably
stupid. Maybe this grass burger idea is just another example, like new
Coke. The thing is though, they did not invent the grass burger or the
idea of it. There are two companies pushing this idea. Impossible
Products and Beyond Meat are producing fake meat products. It was the
former who approached Burger King with the plant burger idea.

Now, it is important to note here that these new fake meat products do
not taste like meat as is claimed. They taste like what people who have
never tasted meat think meat tastes like to humans. The fake beef has
the mouth-feel of oatmeal. It is a weird sort of grainy slime when you
eat it. It is not horrible and if you were starving you would probably
eat it, but cannibalism would start to look appealing. Like the previous
attempts to create fake meat, this new stuff is not very good.

The point is the companies pushing this do not have a better mousetrap.
They are not even making that claim. In fact, they make it clear that
their products are not better than what they seek to replace. In their
public demonstrations they concede that it is, at best, a close
facsimile. Instead, they claim their products are morally superior. You
see, the burger made from grass clippings and dried leaves pleases Gaia.
She will therefore reward the grass eaters and punish the meat eaters.

That is insane, but these products have the backing of the oligarchs.
Both of these companies are supported financially by rich people. The
troubled Bill Gates is
[behind](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/08/bill-gates-backed-impossible-burger-ceo-patrick-brown-on-fighting-meat.html)
the Impossible Burger scheme. He is the guy trying to blot out the sun
because he thinks it is part of the cow conspiracy. [Other
oligarchs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2021/03/25/billionaire-li-ka-shings-horizons-ventures-backs-vegan-ingredient-startup/?sh=1dbf8fe762fe)
are rushing to get in on the fake meat racket as well. All of a sudden,
the rich are sure real meat will go the way of the buggy whip and be
replaced by bugs and grass clippings.

The question is, why? The fact is there is no market for fake meat.
Dozens of efforts to create one, including the current fake burger idea,
have flopped. The fact is the public is not going to voluntarily start
eating bugs and grass clippings just because the climate loons say Gaia
commands it. If the choice is between a real burger and the artificial
alternative, people choose the real burger. In other words, there is no
business opportunity here that the oligarchs are trying to exploit.

That is, unless the government plans to ban meat. Despite the organized
[media
campaign](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/biden-isn-t-taking-away-america-s-hamburgers-here-s-ncna1266036)
by the regime to claim otherwise, the regime is plotting to ban meat.
They will not do it outright, but instead regulate it out of existence.
In the name of climate change, they will make the sale and production of
meat products increasingly expensive. This is why the billionaires all
see fake meat as an opportunity. It is also why recipe sites are now
[removing meat
recipes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/dining/epicurious-beef.html)
from their websites.

In one respect, the highly coordinated media campaign to deny the Biden
war on burgers is correct. There is no design behind this. What is
driving it is the weird new religion taking hold of the American ruling
elite. They really believe that Gaia is angry with us and will unleash
her wrath unless we repent. Of course, they mean repent in that you will
commit the act of contrition and they will get salvation. They also get
to keep eating meat while you dine on spiders and dandelions.

The war on meat is not a conspiracy. It is an example of the Hoffer line
about mass movements in America. They become a business, a racket, or a
corporation. In this case, the Gaia worship sweeping the ruling class is
becoming a business. These grass and twig burger companies are the first
wave of companies hoping to capitalize on the artificially created
market for fake food. They see the madness in the eyes of their peers
and immediately think about how to profit from it.

Of course, all big business in America depends on government. These fake
meat companies and the billionaire sponsor will lobby the state to
create legislation favorable to them and harmful to their opponents. The
political rackets will get a chance to skim some off this new business,
as long as the play ball with fake meat. All of a sudden, real meat has
to increase the bribes to counter fake meat. The war on meat is just
another manifestation of the natural corruption in liberal democracy.
