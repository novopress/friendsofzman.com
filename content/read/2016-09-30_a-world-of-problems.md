Back when the Germans were threatening to shut down Greece and sell it
off for parts, it was fairly obvious that there was no way to “fix” the
Greek problem. Even it were possible to radically overhaul their public
sector, the debt payments are too high to maintain the level of social
services expected from a modern social democracy. Default was
unthinkable because close to 80 percent of Greece’s public debt is owned
by public institutions, primarily the EU governments and the ECB.

The “solution” was to kick the can down the road until a miracle
happened, but now <a

In other words, the miracle did not happen and the problem is now worse.
This comes at a time when <a

There is one solid rule with banking and that is when the biggest bank
is in trouble, all the banks are in trouble. The reason is a bank in
trouble seeks to increase its cash by unwinding its holdings. This puts
downward pressure on the price of those assets, which forces all banks
holding similar assets to revalue and perhaps raise their cash holdings,
by selling assets. This can easily set off a cascading effect, which is
popularly referred to as contagion. <a
href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ghost-of-lehman-brothers-haunts-deutsche-bank-1475193863"
target="_blank">The ghost of Lehman now haunts</a> Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank has something north of €42 Trillion in derivative
exposure. To put that into perspective, the GDP of Europe is €14
Trillion. The phrase “systemic risk” is starting to pop up in news
stories for obvious reasons. Presumably the German government would step
in and bail out the bank, but this is the same German government that
invited millions of Muslims into the country. That and no one really
knows how big the problem is at Deutsche Bank. There’s nothing more
dangerous in the financial world than uncertainty.

If that’s not enough to have you stocking up on potable water and MRE’s,
the news brings word that the Obama Administration is trying its best to
start a war with Russia over Syria. <a
href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN11Z1IY"
target="_blank">They are ending talks with the Russians</a> over the
bombing of Aleppo. The Russians are threatening to impose a no-fly zone,
while John Kerry is making noises about sending troops to Syria. <a
href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/21/obamas-syria-strategy-is-the-definition-of-insanity/"
target="_blank">The US position is completely nuts</a>, which is what
makes it so dangerous. The same people who screwed this up are now
tasked with avoiding a mistake that will lead to a shooting war with the
Russians.

The world always has some problem that could get out of control and
bring the whole thing crashing down, but the odds are usually long
enough to not worry too much. <a
href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1883306/pakistan-threatens-to-destroy-india-with-nuclear-bomb-as-atomic-enemies-edge-to-the-brink-of-war/"
target="_blank">Pakistan is now threatening to nuke India</a>, but that
happens often enough to not take too seriously. Pakistan’s military
understands that they will lose a real war with India. India understands
that they will gain nothing by winning a war against Pakistan. This is
one of those problems that can be managed by the permanent diplomatic
service, with little help from the political class.

The three crisis I’m following all have some things in common. One is
they will require hard choices from the political class to contain. In
politics, a hard choice is one that causes a politician to lose support.
Merkel’s government is already teetering so how willing is she going to
be to make a bold move to rescue Deutsche Bank? The ECB proved unable to
deal with the Greeks the last time. If Merkel is facing a financial
crisis, who will she play bad cop with the Greeks when Tsipris
inevitably comes calling, demanding a break on Greek debt?

The Syria debacle is the most concerning because it resembles so many
European problems of the past. There’s a <a
href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-prepared-send-more-troops-iraq-mosul-offensive-135438730.html"
target="_blank">Seven Year’s War</a> quality to it where you have two
main players with the rest changing teams after every stage. With <a
href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-prepared-send-more-troops-iraq-mosul-offensive-135438730.html"
target="_blank">the US now increasing the troop levels</a> in nearby
Iraq, presumably to fight in one theater of this conflict, the chances
of a mistake increase. In these situations, <a
href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/20/un-halts-all-convoys-in-syria-after-attack-on-aid-trucks.html"
target="_blank">mistakes are often not mistakes</a>, but even when they
are, they become reasons to abandon dialogue in favor of military
options.

We live in a world of trouble. One can be forgiven for having a sense of
foreboding.
