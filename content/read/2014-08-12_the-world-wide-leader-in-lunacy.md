Everyone that watches sports knows ESPN has become this weird fever
swamp of liberal lunacy. They slobber over Obama, for example. They find
a reason to do an Obama story every day, despite the fact Obama knows
nothing about sports and they are supposed to be a sports network. They
are suspending someone for crime think every week it seems. That and
they have notorious bigots like Michael Wilbon and Kevin Blackistone on
regularly.

What’s stunning to me is how they work so hard to destroy the very
things that allow them to exist. For example, they have been cheering
the court cases against the NCAA, even though ESPN counts on college
sports to survive. Yet, their on-air talent is forever cheering the
demise of college sports. We see the same stuff with the NFL and major
league baseball. The only sports they promote are soccer (anti-American)
and basketball, anti-white. Otherwise, they are anti-sports.

Now we have one of their retarded people – and let’s be honest here.
Kevin Cowherd probably has an 85 IQ – is <a
href="http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/cowherd-blames-nascars-southern-eye-eye-culture-drivers-death"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bashing their customers for
NASCAR</a>. Further, he is trying to piss off the part of the country
most crazy for sports – The South. But, as we know from watching these
lunatics, they will jump on a grenade to spite the bogeymen. There are
no more important bogeymen than white southern men.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=11338972" class="external"
rel="nofollow">The Herd</a>, ESPN’s Colin Cowherd partially blamed what
he described as NASCAR’s southern “eye-for-an-eye culture” for the
[tragic death](http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/nascar-faces-enormous-ripple-effects-after-stewarts-car-kills-driver)
of driver Kevin Ward Jr., who was run over by three-time champion Tony
Stewart Saturday at the Canandaigua Motorsport Park dirt track. As for
Stewart, Cowherd said, “I watched the video seven, eight times: He
revved up, other racers put on the brakes.”*

*Cowherd started off the 11 a.m. EST hour with a rant ripping the
“machismo” perpetuated by NASCAR and what he repeatedly called the
“eye-for-an-eye” worldview of the South. During his opening monologue
and his follow-up discussion with NASCAR analyst Marty Smith, Cowherd
criticized the sport for failing to ban running on the track and other
dangerous displays of “bravado” long ago, and suggested a number of
times that three-time champion Tony Stewart could have avoided hitting
Ward.*

*Cowherd began the segment by citing NASCAR’s embrace of dangerous
displays of masculinity and “settling the score,” saying that it, like
the NFL, NHL and boxing, deliberately allowed those elements to draw in
a larger male audience.*

Maybe what they need is some homosexual drivers. Put a couple of
trannies out there and magically it will be better!
