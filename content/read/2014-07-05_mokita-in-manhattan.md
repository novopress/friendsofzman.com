rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I saw this posted on
Drudge</a>. I’m not a fan of Opie & Anthony having never listened to
their program. I’ve seen Anthony Cumia on television, but I have no
opinion of him. He could be a horrible person for all I know.

*Warning: This article contains graphic language.*

Anthony Cumia, of Opie & Anthony radio fame, launched a misogynistic,
racially charged rant after he was allegedly roughed up by a woman in
Times Square.

The 53-year-old shock jock said he was repeatedly punched by the woman
early Tuesday while innocently snapping pictures and she accidentally
got into a frame.

“So I’m taking pix in NYC & a black girl who was in frame punched me in
the face. I called her a f–king “&$;;-:” cause that’s what she WAS!” the
always articulate radio personality tweeted on Wednesday.

The first thing that jumps out is the warning. My goodness. Have we
become such dainty flowers that we can’t take a few dirty words? Then we
have the totally insane idea that accurately mentioning the race of
someone is racist. Thinking maybe the Post left out the really bad
stuff, a highly unlikely possibility, I went to the twitter account and
read the tweets. Crude and stupid maybe, but typical for Twitter. It is,
after all, the preferred communication method of the two-digit IQ
community.

We are headed to a place where basic parts of reality are now off
limits. News accounts avoid mentioning the race of criminals, for
example. A new genre of commenting has arisen in response to this habit.
The readers make sport of the weird absence of basic information in
crime stories involving non-whites. In most cases, the comments are the
best part. Its like a weird game of charades, where everyone looks for
clues to fill in the important bits of the news story.

I’ve written elsewhere that we are becoming a different version of Iran.
They have a small group of lunatics in charge and they force everyone to
go along. The typical Iranian knows the eggplants are nuts, but the
eggplants have the guns. It is simply easier to pretend that you believe
in flying carpets and invisible imams. In modern America, we are
increasing faced with the same choice. You either go along with some
reality warping nonsense like trans-genderism or the lunatics. Cumia
made the great error of noticing the race of his attacker and now he is
out of work.
