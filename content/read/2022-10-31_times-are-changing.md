Last week the people in charge of Penn State University decided to get
in the way-back machine and relive the alt-right days. They invited onto
campus a bogeyman so that the usual suspects could engage in
performative protesting. They invited internet performers Gavin McInnis
and Alex Stein to talk to a student group. A group of entitled children
was then invited to throw a tantrum outside the event. Eventually, the
school cancelled the event for security reasons.

The only people interested in any of it was the
<a href="https://archive.ph/FTJ8J" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regime
media</a> that has yet to find a new set of bogeymen to replace those
from the Trump years. McInnis went along with it because it is all he
has at this point. His edgy right-wing guy act fell apart with the Proud
Boys fiasco and dissidents have no interest in him. Alex Stein is trying
to be the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKJZfa7sWV_qKxQnLBUpjA"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matthew Lesko</a> of ambush comedy, so
this provided him with a chance to do his act in front of some purple
faced coeds for the streaming audience.

The main takeaway from the event is that the white supremacist bogeyman
act has run its course and the regime has found nothing to replace it.
As a result, the usual suspects are resurrecting old villains like
McInnes. The term “Proud Boys” is still something of a dog whistle for
the crazies, even though the rest of the world lost interest in the
whole thing years ago. It is sort of like how Nixon remained a villain
for the crazies well into the 1980’s, after the world had moved onto
Reagan.

Of course, the point of these manufactured dramas is for the people
running the college campus to pretend they are in a state of emergency.
The college campus is the safest place on the planet, but the
inhabitants need to feel they are under siege. The forces of darkness
are closing in so they have to heroically defend their abracadabra word
from the enemy of the abracadabra word. They stage these events so that
they can have a few minutes where their fantasies seem real.

If it were anything other than a performance, they could easily handle
these things by either not hosting the speakers or putting an end to the
protests. There is no reason for a college campus to have these sorts of
people on to talk to students. In theory, at least, the students are
there to learn, not hear hacky gags from an aging comedian and an
internet prankster. Not only are these two not bringing anything to the
campus, their act is easily accessible on-line.

On the other hand, the campus could end the protest business by
expelling those who create trouble. The students are there to learn and
this event was a good time for them to learn that it is immoral to
prevent people from speaking or prevent others from hearing a speaker.
Expel a few of the troublemakers and the protest culture comes to a
screeching halt. This is a state college. These are not future leaders.
They are there to get a credential in order to get a middle-class job.

What these sorts of events amount to are something like the historical
reenactments around events of the Civil War or Revolutionary War.
Historical reenactors enjoy learning the fine details of the period.
They spend hours getting their costumes right and working with others in
the subculture. Another part of it is escapism. They get to spend the
weekend pretending to be a person in another era, an era they find more
interesting than the current era.

That is what we have seen on campus for half a century. The long march
through the institutions put the old protestors in charge, so they set
about recreating the events of their youth, except this time they were
the cool administrators. Unlike the squares running the place in their
youth, they were down with the cause, at least until something got
broken or someone got hurt. Decade after decade this farcical game of
make believe gets rebooted on the college campus.

That said, this nonsense may have run its course. One of the weird side
effects of the Covid panic is it broke the pattern. For two years no one
was allowed on campus, so they could not stage these dramas. The
attention whores that agree to play the bogeyman role for these shows
have had to move onto other things. Penn State was left with what can
charitably be called D-list bogeymen. Instead of playing weddings they
jumped at this campus gig.

There is also a growing regime fatigue. That is another consequence of
Covid and the events of the 2020 election. The endless lying from the
media has shifted public opinion away from this sort of drama. When
people thought the campus was simply biased, they could justify people
trying to get on campus to counter the bias. In a world where people use
the term “regime” and assume everything that comes from official
authority is a lie, these dramas make no sense.

Of course, the January 6 pogrom has changed minds as well. In a world
where the state will arrest you for being attacked by regime agents
posing as protestors, going onto the street to speak your mind is a
fool’s errand. Even the flag and costume crowd has figured out that they
cannot march around in public. This leaves the regime elements on their
own, which makes for a boring performance. Without a bogeyman to attack,
they are left to stare at one another.

All of this points to a slight maturing of dissident politics. Guys like
McInnis are not getting attention anymore. He staged his own arrest and
the response was mostly indifference at his pathetic play for attention.
Similarly, more and more dissidents are simply tuning out of regime
media. These dramas only work if there is an audience and that audience
is drying up. Slowly, it seems, dissidents are disconnecting from the
machine and accepting the new reality.
