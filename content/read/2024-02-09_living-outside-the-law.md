A recurring theme in the parade of madness that passes for the public
life of late empire America is the lawlessness. Every week we get some
new outrageous subversion of the law from the courts or from the
government. These are the institutions charged with defending the law
because it is the law that ultimately defends the people. The reason we
have government is to defend the law.

The Steyn case is the latest example, but hardly a surprising one.
Slowly people are coming to understand that if you go into a courtroom
it is a lottery and that assumes they cannot accuse you of heresy. Even
under ideal conditions you could be faced with a deranged lunatic as a
judge or a jury full of morons. Trial by combat is now a preferable
option than the American court system.

We also got word from the government that Joe Biden cannot and will not
be charged with mishandling government secrets because he is non compos
mentis, but he can be president, while Trump can be charged because he
is not insane or demented, but he cannot be president. You have to
wonder if we are in a simulation and the people running it have been
dropping acid.

It would be funny except that real harm is being done to people. Men are
being sent away to dungeons for being white or holding the wrong
opinions. Steyn now has to raise a million dollars because he sinned
against Gaia. The real harm, however, is to the law itself which is what
makes civilization possible. The crazies are making everyone an outlaw
by destroying the idea of the law.

If you create enough outlaws, eventually you create some people who feel
they have nothing to lose as an outlaw. Right now the outlaws are still
coming to terms with being made outlaws. They still hope to come back
inside the law, but in time some will simply decide the price is not
worth it. Get enough people who like being outlaws and you end up with a
war of all against all.
