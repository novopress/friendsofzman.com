Buried in the news of Muslim lunatics shooting up a French newspaper
office, the Black Guerrilla Family <a
href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/black-guerrilla-family-gang-sends-armed-man-to-tes/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">sent an armed man into a police
station</a> to test their security.

*A member of the Black Guerrilla Family (BGF) gang, armed with a loaded
.22 caliber handgun, walked into a Baltimore police station on Tuesday
in order to test its security, police said.*

*Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said the 29-year-old man
walked into the Northeastern District station “fully armed and loaded
with drugs on him,” The Baltimore Sun reported.*

*“An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into
our building to see our security, to test our security. That is alarming
to us, to me. I am going to send a message that we are not going to
cower, we’re not going to back down,” Mr. Batts said.*

*Police said the man was enlisted by BGF to test police security for
allegedly betraying the gang in the past.*

*“He did not go in there on his free will. This person had very little
option, according to his statement, which lends credibility to what a
dire situation this was,” Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez
said.*

*The police commissioner is ordering security changes throughout the
department. Security has also been enhanced in neighboring Baltimore
County, a local NBC affiliate reported.*

*“The Baltimore County Police Department has received information about
an incident at the Baltimore City Police Northeast District Station this
morning,” Cpl. John Wachter said in a statement.*

*“In response to this, we have made necessary adjustments to our
operations to ensure the safety of officers, professional staff and
visitors at our facilities.”*

The denouement of the New Left in the late sixties and early seventies
was the decay of the Civil Rights movement into anarchy and violence.
The anarchy was easy. Riots all over America in the inner cities wrecked
black neighborhoods, drove away the tax base and condemned millions of
blacks to a life of squalor. The violence was more sophisticated.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Black Panthers</a> worked hard to
look like something other than a race-based street gang.
<a href="http://gangs.umd.edu/Gangs/BLACKGUERILLAFAMILY.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Black Guerrilla Family</a> started
out as a prison reform movement, but quickly became a hyper-violent
prison gang.

How the Civil Rights Movement went from peaceful demands for legal
rights to anarchic violence has been thrown down the memory hole. David
Horowitz, the guy right there during the rise and fall of the Black
Panthers and Black Guerrilla Family, has written about it. His book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Destructive-Generation-Second-Thoughts-Sixties/dp/1594030820"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Destructive Generation,</a> is a must
reading for anyone trying to understand the Left in America. Otherwise,
the whole sorry episode has been erased from the narrative.

As Horowitz documents in his books, the Black Panther Party was largely
a creation of the New Left. Not satisfied with steady progress in race
relations, the Left radicalized the movement, peeling off violent and
psychotic young males to form the new vanguard, which happened to look a
lot like a street gang. The whole point was to scare the bleep out of
the squares. The rape, torture and murder of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Betty_Van_Patter"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Betty van Patter</a>, a progressive white
woman committed to the cause, finally discredited the operation for
good.

The BGF followed a similar arc. Liberal fanatics with law degrees went
to war with the criminal justice system in the late 60’s. Under the
guise of prison reform and racial justice, activists like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Stender" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Fay Stender</a> helped former Black Panther members in
and out of prison. The result was the Black Guerrilla Family, a violent
prison gang. The BGF repaid their liberal enablers by having Stender
shot in front of her son. She lived, but was paralyzed and eventually
committed suicide.

In the 70’s, the radicals did not have access to sophisticated
technology and strategies. They just made crude pipe bombs and left them
in public places. Today they can take advantage of the communications
revolution to learn all sorts of new tricks. The good news is the supply
of young males looking for adventure is at an all-time low. Still, the
period of violence, which marks the end of a progressive awakening, is
upon us.
