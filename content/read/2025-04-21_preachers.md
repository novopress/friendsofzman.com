control of the Democratic Party, a post about the younger generation of
males, and no Sunday podcast as it was Easter. Subscribe

One of the amusing sideshows since Trump has taken power is the pearl
clutching from the usual suspects about the law and process. The people
who sat silent as lawfare was waged against Americans for the crime of
holding unapproved opinions are now suddenly concerned with the rule of
law. The people who took money from tech companies to remain silent
about tech censorship are now carrying on as if they are dissidents
because they no longer control the discourse.

Hypocrisy is a feature of man, and it has always had a central role in
American politics because America is a nation of moralizers. The one
thing we have always overproduced is preachers ready to wag their bony
fingers at the people as they lecture them about their many moral
failings. The United States is a giant outdoor revival tent where
preachers take turns performing for the crowd. When not lecturing the
locals, our preachers travel the world to lecture foreigners.

Preachers need to believe they are special, perhaps even called or
chosen to lead the sinners out of sin into the land of salvation. You
cannot think you are a wretch and at the same time be a preacher. You
can be a wretch and confess your wretchedness to the people in the pews
as part of your redemption. You can testify about your former
wretchedness and how you rejoined the mass of ordinary sinners. You
cannot preach unless you are sure you are something special.

After all, the point of preaching is to inform. The preacher not only
knows the nature of sin, but he also claims to know the nature of grace.
He claims to know the road that leads from sin to salvation and grace.
If everyone had this knowledge, then there would be no need for the
preacher. Everyone would be free to decide if they want to take the path
to salvation or take some other path. This is why every preacher is sure
he has been called to lead the sinner down the righteous path.

This is why the fallen preacher is a stock character in our morality
tales. In a land full of preachers, we have a superabundance of
preachers who turned out to be worse sinners than the people in the
pews. Given that democratic politics is just a long running morality
play, it is no surprise that our politics features the hypocrite, and
the endless cries of hypocrisy are the Greek chorus of our politics.
Democracy is a viper’s den of preachers and hypocrites hissing about
hypocrisy.

This has been a defining feature of the Trump era. His every utterance
seems to draw out the preacher-hypocrite.
<a href="https://x.com/JonahDispatch/status/1913364919963001292"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is Jonah Goldberg hilariously
claiming he is what stands between the mean orange man and the sacred
Constitution. He and his fellow cult members were chanting about the
“unitary executive” back in the Bush years, when they intended that
phrase to mean, “Ignore the laws.” After all, they preached, the
righteous cause of forever war was too important for due process.

Goldberg is typical of the modern preacher. He is a mediocrity’s
mediocrity who spends his days smearing people opposed to his cult. In
the Bush years, he would preach about the need to rally to a clown like
George Bush out of party loyalty. Those questioning this were disloyal
deviationists or secretly in league with Old Scratch. When it was his
turn to return the favor with Trump, he slanderously
<a href="https://archive.ph/pbRx8" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">claimed</a> Trump and David Duke were buddies in the
secret KKK.

The most egregious example of the modern preacher is David French. This
chinless weirdo is what not-for-profit politics produces. He imagines
himself to be a blend of James Bond, Clarence Darrow, and Jesus Christ.
His Twitter feed is dripping with sanctimony as he lectures the world
about sin, but it is mostly about the righteousness of David French. It
is no surprise that this ridiculous mediocrity is at the New York Times.
It is the main chapel of our media.

These two festering lumps of mediocrity are famous examples, but the
public square is littered with people who dream of one day standing in
front of the masses, lecturing them about their failings. The Covid
Karens of a few years ago made clear that behind the pleasant looking
face of every stranger could lie the pursed lips of a vinegar drinking
scold ready to pounce at your moment of weakness. We are sinners in the
hands of an angry God named Karen from Human Resources.

The preacher plays a vital role in human society, but he must be locked
up in his church where we can visit him for inspiration. The preacher
provides inspiration when inspiration is needed to continue the task of
living. In modern America, the preachers have been let out of their
churches to run wild in our lives, making sure no one can enjoy the
simple act of living. They nose about looking for sin and when none can
be found they create chaos that can lead to sin.

The task before the country, if it is to escape this hell of
proselytizing, is to herd the preachers back into their churches. Living
is about trade-offs, the choice between practical benefits and equally
practical costs. For a people to live, they must embrace living, not sit
quietly while preached to about the sins of living. That is what we are
seeing with the Trump administration. It is the long overdue effort to
round up the preachers and put them back in their rightful place.

The price for this freedom will be the endless hypocrisy from the pearl
clutchers and bony fingered ministers, now suddenly concerned about law
and order. They were silent when the law was ignored but now pretend to
care when the law must be ignored to restore order, the only ground in
which the law can flourish. That means sidelining the preachers until
the coast is clear. Then they can be let loose to preach the gospel of
republican virtue to whoever will listen.
