Yesterday, internet activist Christopher Rufo
<a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1846646014943678609"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on Twitter a long post
denouncing, disavowing and anathematizing someone named Chris Brunet.
Apparently, Brunet used to work for Rufo or maybe they were friends, but
Rufo now finds that old association inconvenient to his current
relationships and career choices, so he decided to do the predictable
thing and denounce Brunet. It is a weird form of public piety that the
conservatives inherited from communism.

For those of a certain age, this is familiar stuff. While the format is
different from the old days of conservatism, the act is the same. That
post reads like a Twitter version of Bill Buckley’s denunciation of Pat
Buchanan thirty years ago. Interestingly, that famous essay is nowhere
to be found online, but the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Anti-Semitism-William-F-Buckley/dp/082640619X"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> version is still available.
Imagine someone writing a forty-thousand-word essay denouncing someone
then being so proud of it that he turned it into a book.

That is the first notable thing about this bit of drama. Those familiar
with the history of conservatism recognize this performance. The person
putting on the show is doing it for an audience that is never named, but
always assumed. The stated audience is either credulous, incredulous or
confused by the performance. Everything about this age is a reboot,
especially the stuff that emanates from the political class, so the “new
right” is just a low-budget reboot of the old right.

There is a Little Rascals quality to all of it. They put on the costumes
of the past and reenact events as they think they happened, but in a
high school musical sort of way, which makes it feel small and petty.
Thirty years ago, Buchanan and Buckley were towering figures fighting
for the right to define a sociopolitical movement they helped create,
while Rufo and Burnet are two guys on the internet. To his credit,
Burnett seems to appreciate the absurdity of it.

The resulting drama brings up another notable aspect. Then as now, the
people doing the denouncing always couch their denunciations in moral
terms, when it is obvious that they are motivated by money. Buckley knew
there were loads of cash waiting for him if he denounced the paleocons.
The neocons, Zionists and the Israel lobby were as flush with cash
thirty years ago as they are now. They hated the critics of these things
as much as they hate them today.

There is nothing wrong with currying favor with rich people. The
“American experiment” is pretty much an institutionalized version of
this habit. The market economy, after all, is nothing more than people
with something to sell chasing after and flattering people who have
money to spend. Democratic politics is the art of flattering wealthy
interests so they will back your candidacy. There is a reason that one
of the highest paid people at every Washington think tank is the
fundraiser.

In theory, the one group most comfortable with this reality should be
the conservatives, as they boast of being the most free-market of the
bunch. Yet, they are the ones most ashamed of being men for hire. They
cast all their actions in moral terms, often making it seem like they
are engaged in the greatest of moral struggles. David French has made a
career of nailing himself to the cross. So much so, in fact, that he has
attained what all conservatives seek, a place at the New York Times!

It is a strange quirk of conservatism. Read the comments of that Rufo
post and you see the phrase “moral clarity” turn up often. It is as if
these people have a strange form of Tourette’s that only comes out when
they are finking on one another. It brings to mind the famous quote from
Emerson, “The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our
spoons.” Whenever a conservative begins speaking of moral clarity, get
ready for a load of arrows in your back.

The reason for this is the central contradiction of conservatism. They
start by agreeing with the central premise of progressivism, which is
that all people are equal and infinitely malleable. Hierarchy is
therefore a construct. You cannot oppose an egalitarian ideology like
progressivism by first agreeing with its central claim, so conservatives
can never admit that they are simply doing the bidding of their patrons.
That means they must invent other reasons which they call principles.

That aside, the sense that this is just recycled drama from a bygone age
is due to progressivism becoming a backward-looking phenomenon. It
evolved to its logical endpoint only to find nothing there. The modern
progressive must content himself with refighting old fights with old
enemies reimagined for this time. The new Nazi is the guy opposed to
Israel carpet bombing civilians. The new Bull Connor is the guy
wondering why the FBI is faking crime stats.

The new right is now following suit. They search around for someone to
play the Pat Buchanan role or the Joe Sobran role. It will not be long
before these guys pick a fight with the Birchers, which is
<a href="https://jbs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still
around</a>, amazingly enough. Conservatism has always been the slow
version of progressivism, so as progressives become a strange sort of
antiquarian society, conservatives will slowly join them in the project.
The left-right debate is about who hates the past the most.

Of course, what they truly hate is the future. Both progressivism and
conservatism are artifacts of a bygone age. They reached their peak in
the twentieth century at the zenith of the Global American Empire. That
was an empire built for a world that not only does not exist, but the
memory of which is fading into the past. Imagine conservatism and
progressivism as two old ships engaged in battle as they slowly slip
over the horizon, and you have a good sense of it.

In the meantime, they will continue to engage in their mock battles with
each other and with themselves, pretending to believe that things have
not changed and will never change, while terrified by the sense that
they are changing. Like science, politics advances one funeral at a
time. As the codgers of the old politics march off to the cemetery, they
will be replaced first by their imitators and then by their
replacements, who will create a new politics for their age and
challenges.
