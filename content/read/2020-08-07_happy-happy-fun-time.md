As the title suggests, this week’s show is about the good news that is
out there if you care to look for it. This side of the great divide
tends to focus on the negative stuff, often to the exclusion of the
positive. That often leads people into despair, which is never a good
thing. Despair is a sin for a reason. The antidote to despair is not
unwarranted optimism, but reasonableness. The world may be going to Hell
in a hand basket, but there are still good things happening out there.

The worst part of despair is those who fall into it almost always try to
pull the rest of us into their pit of misery. They cook up elaborate
conspiracy theories about how great forces are working to turn the
lights off on civilization. They become entities who live to suck the
joy out of life for those around them. Just as living well is the best
revenge, enjoying life is the best counter to despair. Life is short and
even in these dark times there is plenty that can make you laugh.

That’s always a good tell. Whenever the Left is in high spirits, you
know they have a firm grip on things and are feeling confident. When
they are sour faced and miserable, you know they are gripped by fear.
Look around and you can’t find a single lefty that is not filled with
anger, angst and dread. That alone should be a morale boost. Sure, they
darken every corner with their ugliness, but their misery should give us
hope, because it means they fear it is all slipping away from them.

It is also good to keep in mind that our enemies rely on fear,
uncertainty a despair to keep us disorganized and inactive. Much of what
we are seeing in the news these days is about spreading the FUD. These
people have turned their hatred of Trump into a weird religious
experience. Like people waiting for space aliens to arrive, they are
sure the end point of their obsession is the end of the orange man in
November. That can only happen if they convince us the end is certain.

On a personal note, this is also the time of year when I tend to cheer
up, as the summer is nearing an end and autumn is not far off. Summer is
my least favorite season, while autumn is my favorite time of year.
Winter is my second favorite season, so around now, like the world
anticipating the return of Persephone in spring, I’m looking forward to
her going back to the underworld. That, of course, tends to put me in
good spirits, so a show about the positive things seemed like a good
idea.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

discount to readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
