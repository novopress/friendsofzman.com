There’s a term called the “heckler’s veto” which describes how lunatics
are able to stifle normal public discourse. Colleges will not invite Ann
Coulter to speak anymore because the lunatics are so disruptive the
school fears harm could come to their students. The crazies over at
Media Matters and The Southern Poverty Law Center work from this
premise. In both cases it is a small number of people, but they make
such a ruckus it is easier to go along with their racist demands than do
the right thing.

The thing is, Media Matters et al. rely on mass media to pull their
stunts. One of the weird consequence to the technological revolution is
we now have the lunatics veto and the stupid person veto to go along
with the heckler’s veto. Because we made it so easy for the stupid and
crazy to reach a broad audience, we are more aware of them than at any
time in human history. Matt Osborne, in another age, would have passed
the time playing checkers with the other patients at the local asylum.
Today he participates in public debate.

Steve Sailer has <a
href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/the-rise-of-the-lumpenintelligentsia/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> about the
increasing number of two-digit IQ’s writing for popular websites. That
column by Daisy Hernandez is funny, but it is also a good example of the
the stupid person veto.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Hern%C3%A1ndez"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Her bio</a> suggests she is
clever enough to fool others in her slice of the bell curve, but she is
not adding anything to the stock of human capital. In a different age,
she would be a secretary at an office somewhere or at home raising
children. She’s also not a “woman of color” but she’s smart enough to
know that’s how stupid people gain a toe-hold in the opinion rackets
these days. Liz Warren got a job at Harvard once she became a fake
Indian.

Reading her column, you see a familiar game. Some self-described victim
declares herself to be a moral authority. That gives her a veto over the
rest of us. After all, the only reason *her* “white male editor” spiked
*her* asylum story is *he* is a racist. His pointing out the idiocy of
such a proposal is the proof. After all, only “skinny white guys” notice
that dimwits like Ms. Hernandez have heads for of goofy ideas. Because
it is so easy for blockheads like Daisy to get on twitter and Facebook,
they can now shout down everyone else.

I’m fond of pointing out that the mouth breathers on MSNBC were not
allowed on TV and radio thirty years ago. The men running television and
radio, sympathetic to the causes of these lunatics, were still
responsible enough to keep these nuts off the air. They rightly feared
the consequence. Even now, without mandatory cable fees MSNBC would go
out of business in a week. technology has flung open the asylum doors
and we are awash in dimwits and lunatics. The sane and sober are drowned
out and the results follow.
