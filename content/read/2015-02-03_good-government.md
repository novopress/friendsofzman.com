It is assumed, by liberal lunatics, that those who oppose them are
universally against government. That’s complete nonsense, of course, but
that’s what happens when you live in a country run by a religious cult.
The truth is the Old Right and now the Dissident Right always thought
government was essential to civilization. What must be guarded against
is the excess of government.

Men are not angels. That is where the discussion must begin and end when
it comes to investing power. Give government too much power and the men
in charge will inevitably abuse it. Give corporations too much power and
they will eventually abuse it. It is at the heart of

Anyway, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">here’s a good example</a> of what
government can do and should do.

*Numerous store brand supplements aren’t what their labels claim to be,
an ongoing investigation of popular herbal supplements subjected to DNA
testing has found, New York state’s top law enforcement official said
Tuesday.*

*GNC, Target, Walmart and Walgreen Co. sold supplements that either
couldn’t be verified to contain the labeled substance or that contained
ingredients not listed on the label, Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman’s office said.*

*The supplements, including echinacea, ginseng, St. John’s wort, garlic,
ginkgo biloba and saw palmetto, were contaminated with substances
including rice, beans, pine, citrus, asparagus, primrose, wheat,
houseplant and wild carrot. In many cases, unlisted contaminants were
the only plant material found in the product samples.*

*Overall, 21 percent of the test results from store brand herbal
supplements contained DNA from the plants listed on the labels. The
retailer with the poorest showing was Walmart, where 4 percent of the
products tested showed DNA from the plants listed on the labels.*

Supplement makers sell products to the public claiming they are safe and
possess magical powers. The government should be randomly testing these
things to make sure they are safe and that the claims on the bottles are
honest. The public needs to know if they are eating sawdust or
houseplants.

Now, I know where you’re going to go. The state does not stop at
testing. They will inevitably reach out the greedy hand demanding a
bribe. The same inspectors who are checking the safety of these pills
will be unleashed on some politically incorrect company doing all sorts
of damage in the name of the one true faith.

Well, that’s true. There’s nothing magical about any of this. Give
people too much power and you get abuse. That’s not an argument against
government. it is an argument against big government.
