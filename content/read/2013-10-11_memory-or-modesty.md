Gavin McInnes is a funny and interesting character on cable television.
He just sort of appeared, but he allegedly was a star of some sort in
the New York underground publishing scene. It’s hard to know if that is
true, since everyone on TV has a fake back story. Regardless, McInnes is
funny and outlandish, but also strikingly sensible, in contrast to the
robots on cable news channels. He does his best when he feigns outrage
and goes full-on Archie Bunker. It’s a fun act that works well for him.

His writing, however, is a different story.
<a href="http://streetcarnage.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">His
website</a> looks like what old people do to try and appear hip. The
design is cheesy and dated, but the content is like something Boomers
thought was funny in their youth. Putting pics of half-naked women in
the pages of a men’s magazine was edgy in the 1990’s. There’s a lazy
man’s edginess to that sort of presentation.  The whole site has an “try
too hard” feel to it, like old people trying to appeal to young people.
It’s aging hipsters talking about their glory days.

In fact, that seems to be a running theme in his columns and postings.
On the one hand he is at the age when he can no longer pretend to be
young. On the other hand, he is not ready to be old and finds the whole
experience to be mystifying. Sadly, he suffers from that common modern
malady of thinking that everything new to him is, in fact, totally new,
so he talks about the mundane as if it is a revelation. We live in an
age in which no one can seem to remember last week, much less trends
from previous generations.

His <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest on Taki</a> is a good example of
cultural amnesia. Everyone is carry on as if Miley Cyrus is something
new, when she is just another version of the same act the entertainment
complex has been churning out for decades. Female entertainers using
sexual charged lyrics, dress and antics to attract a crowd probably
dates to the dawn of civilization. In fact, sex and pop music have been
a paring sine the dawn of the recording industry. Just listen to an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnC08oTcdLk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">old jazz or blues collection</a> and you see it.

In the modern era, acts like Wendy O. Williams were selling raunchy
sexuality on stage in the 1970’s. Madonna ripped off a big part of her
act from Williams. Later female entertainers ripped off Madonna’s
naughty school girl act. The only thing new about the Cyrus act is that
it is so cheesy and fake. The female sex acts of previous generations at
least had some talent and looked good. Cyrus is kind of gross looking
and she sounds like a bag of cats. She looks like a bar skank on amateur
night at the titty bar.

The thing is though, McInness is not an amnesiac. He’s simply responding
to what he sees around him and that is a strange collective amnesia.
It’s like American culture has suddenly forgotten the last 30-40 years
and is now pretending to be scandalized squares from the 1950’s. Maybe
the taste makers of the cultural class have decided that being
scandalized was too much fun to let slip away, so everyone now has to
pretend these new bawdy acts are new.

On the other hand, it could simply be that the technological age is
destroying collective memory. Why remember anything when you can look it
up on your phone? No one can follow directions or read a map anymore
thanks to GPS. The young literally have never had a need to read a map
or understand north and south. It’s not unrealistic to think we are
headed to a place where everyone lives in the moment. Once something
happens and is experienced, it is forgotten so it can be replaced by the
next thing.
