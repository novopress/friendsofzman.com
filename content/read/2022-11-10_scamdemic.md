A feature of this age that has slowly evolved to be the centerpiece of
our society is the fact that nothing is on the level. The central issue
with the last election, for example, is the degree of shenanigans. Few
people care about the platforms or people, outside of a few absurd
examples. What matters to everyone are the many questions about the
integrity of the process. Ours is an age where nothing is on the level
and everyone is assumed to be up to something underhanded.

America is a marketplace society and the marketplace has always been the
natural hunting ground for people who like to take advantage of their
fellow man. This was something the ancient Persians observed about the
Athenians. The agora, as far as the Persians could tell, was where
Greeks tried to take advantage of their fellow Greeks through deception.
Greek democracy was the marketplace applied to the arena of politics,
which meant politics was based on deception.

The thing is, America has always been a marketplace society, but
everyone assumed that we enjoyed a minimum amount of corruption.
Businesses would cheat, but the marketplace would eventually expose them
and they would suffer. It has always been assumed that the power of the
marketplace, the invisible hand, eventually rewards the good and
punishes the bad. The same has been assumed about politics. The best
rise to the top while the fakers are eventually exposed.

Present day people would probably be embarrassed to hear themselves
thirty years ago talking about politics or the economy. Regardless of
your road to wherever you are now, the old you was a naïve and silly
version of the present you, because present you is wise to the
shenanigans. Ours is a world where no one is an idealist who trusts the
system or imagines a better world. Everyone is a cynic now. The reason
is the world is now run by hustlers always looking for a sucker.

Take pets as an example. Put the phrase “pet scam” into a search engine
and you will find pages of various hustles in the pet business. This
<a href="https://petscams.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">page</a>
offers a searchable database of pet scams. There is a whole industry
around robbing people who simply want to bring a little joy into their
home. Think about the sort of person who comes up with a way to rob
people looking for a puppy for their kid. More important, think about
the society that tolerates this.

Of course, puppy scams are just a version of the much larger scams that
dominate the modern American economy. The news brings word that another
cryptocurrency <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/here-are-all-funds-are-about-lose-billions-ftx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">exchange</a> is collapsing. Like all the
others, this one was not a genuine business, but an elaborate way to rob
investors. No one thinks much about these things because they have
become so common. Finance is just a lightly regulated casino where
insiders find new ways to take advantage of the marks.

It is tempting say that the stock market has always been a casino, but
keep in mind that everyone’s retirement and lifestyle now depends on
equities. The con men and hustlers who define the global economy are now
relied upon to keep the system running so you can live a decent life. We
have literally based the welfare of our societies on the good decisions
of people who are incapable of telling the truth. The heart of our
system is an economy based on deception.

There was a time when the government made some effort to tamp down the
shenanigans, but that no longer happens. Everyone now accepts that their
mobile device will be hit with scam phone calls and scam texts every
day. The carriers should be able to block this stuff, but they have no
reason to. It is not as if the government that supposedly regulates them
is going to hassle them for it. The government is too busy producing
disinformation to go after scammers.

That is the thing about this age that is different from the past.
Scammers have always been with us, but these days we just accept it.
Within living memory, we expected the government to make their best
efforts to go after fraudsters. We used to have higher expectations of
our politicians than we now have for our doctor. Like everything else,
the people providing the most intimate services are assumed to be part
of some hustle to separate us from our hard earned money.

The question that naturally arises is can a society exist where no one
trusts anything or anyone in the society? Can you have a purely
transactional society where everyone is trying to get over on everyone
else? Right now, things are relatively calm, but that is mostly because
most people have not embraced the new normal. There are still plenty of
trusting souls to keep the old hardware of society running, despite the
proliferation of people looking for ways to rob these people.

Western societies have always been moral societies. Your status is
determined by your perceived morality. It is why we have always assumed
that rich people must be smart and contribute something valuable to
society. The proof of this is that they have been rewarded with wealth
and power. What happens when the number of trusting souls declines below
some level where trust and honesty are seen as vices? Can we have a
society where deception is the coin of the realm?

In his book, *The Jewish Century*, Yuri Slezkine divided the world into
two types of people, Mercurians and Apollonians. The former provides
services to lubricate commerce, finance and politics. The latter are
tied to their native lands, producing the goods required of society.
America in the 20th century, according to Slezkine, was transformed by
the Mercurians to reflect their interests. America had become a
middleman society.

If the sum of your intercourse with other people is bounded by the
momentary transaction, there is no profit in consideration. Why would
parties to the transaction care about the interests of the other
parties, when they will no longer have a reason to interact with them
once the transaction is completed? Altruism and empathy quickly become
liabilities to be exploited by the clever. All the rewards point toward
profiting in the moment and moving on to the next deal.

What we are experiencing is the inversion of individualism. In a moral
society, judging the individual on their actions results in a
competition among members to uphold the shared morality of society. In a
middleman society, where no one cares to judge anyone, the result is a
Hobbesian competition of all against all. Ripping off moms with
fraudulent puppy ads on Facebook comes with no reputational penalty.
Worst case, you pay a fine and start the scam all over again.

Ten thousand years of evolution are not overcome in a few generations,
so this current crisis is most likely the conflict between the system
and our nature. The reason half of our young people have mental health
<a href="https://studyfinds.org/gen-z-mental-health-condition/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">problems</a> is that they have been born
into unnatural societies. This is not normal. Women are taking
antidepressants because they did not evolve to live in a no-trust
society. Male suicide rates are at record highs for the same reason. Our
society is hostile to our existence.
