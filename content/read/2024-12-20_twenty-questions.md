The final show of the year is a double album set. That means two hours
of the dulcet sound of my voice jumping through twenty topics. There
were a lot of good questions this time, so rather than try to figure out
which ones were the best, I decided to do a two hour show and cover them
all. There were some left out only because they were duplicates or not
appropriate for a family show.

A few will become full shows in the new year. While I was talking about
Strauss it occurred to me that it would make for a good trio of shows.
One hour on Strauss, one hour on the neocons and one hour on Claremont.
All three are tangled up together and all three are relevant to the next
administration. There are more than a few people from the Jaffa cult in
the Trump team.

Another thing that occurred to me while doing the show is a good feature
of the new site would be a way to submit show ideas and questions/topics
for these multi-topic shows that people seem to like. Over the holidays
I am hoping to make some progress on the new site and maybe have it done
next month. If anyone has ideas feel free to post them up in the
comments

Otherwise, this is the final show of the year, other than the green door
show. There will be a Sunday show and maybe some video experiments. That
is another project on the drawing board. I did some experiments from the
back of the truck the other day, so I might test those out over the
holiday break. On the other hand, if they are terrible, I might save
myself the trouble and scrap the idea.
