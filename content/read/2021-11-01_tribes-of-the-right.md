Note: The Monday Taki
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/heroes-and-villains-2/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is posted. It is a theme I have
explored many times, but that audience seems be a different audience
from those here. The Sunday Thoughts
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/454121" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">podcast</a> is up behind the green door. Lots of
conspiracy talk and mild rant about the show trial taking place in
Charlottesville.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If it was possible to hold a convention of people who makes some claim
to being right-wing, it would be a quite a crowd. Polling consistently
shows that about 40% of white Americans identify as conservative. About
20% identify as liberal. The remaining 40% probably lean proportionally.
People who claim to be “moderate” are always left-wing, often far-left.
On the other hand, people with no interest tend to live right-wing, so
it is hard to know for sure how the undocumented fall.

Regardless, the right side of the scale is a crowded place, but there is
not much agreement on what it means to be right-wing in America. For
example, many of the gentry conservatives would not be caught dead at
the same convention as many of the tribes on the Right. These are the
people who listen to Ben Shapiro and think the worst people are those
hated most by the Left. These are the people who voted against Trump
because, well, that is what they were told.

Another group that would hesitate to attend a convention of the Right
are the people generally referred to as normies. These are people who
think the Democrats are the real racists and Israel is our greatest
ally. They get mad over CRT because it is bad for black people and
immigrants. They voted for Trump, even though he was accused of being
Hitler, because they are sure that he does not see race. These are the
civic nationalists who are the majority of the Right.

Just down the road from them is another large group that could be
described as the Disgruntled Right. Most used to be in the civic
nationalist camp, and most will vote for Trump in 2024, even though they
have lost faith in the system. They acknowledge that America has a
demographic problem and they oppose immigration, but they still hold out
hope that reform is possible. Like the old paleocons, this camp tends to
think the nation is headed for a disaster and possibly collapse.

Another large group that is getting larger, mostly drawing from the
prior two camps, are the Religious/Traditionalists. These are people who
were active in the social conservative scene, but now that it has been
overrun with grifters from Conservative Inc., they are going to ground.
These could also be called the Rod Dreher conservatives, although most
would reject his goofy outlook. This group is looking to recapture an
older sense of religious and traditional community.

Those three groups probably comprise 80% of the people who would call
themselves right-wing or conservative. Polling does not help, as the
polling outfits subscribe to the left-wing view of politics. That is,
there are good people chosen by history and then there are evil people
who hate history. Even so, the popularity of various figures gives an
indication of the crowd sizes. A Christian/Traditionalist guy like Nick
Fuentes will draw a big crowd, but not as big as Ben Shapiro.

The remaining 20% has used various labels, none of which have performed
all that well over the years. White Nationalism is considered an
epithet, mostly because ridiculous people claiming to be white
nationalists played the role written for them by the Left over the last
half century. Similarly, the term alt-right fell out of favor a few
years ago when it became associated with ridiculous people. Both terms
also suffered from a lack of definition that opened the door to
shenanigans.

Even so, this tribe has persisted over the last 70 years. These people
are what should be called the Revanchist Right. They persist throughout
the West, so it is a phenomenon that transcends America. These are
people who seek to return to some earlier period and have a do-over.
They are not romantics, looking to return to a better time, even though
they are inspired by the past. Instead, they seek to return to some
prior starting point and replay history.

For example, there are revanchists in America who would like to return
to the 1950’s and replay the civil rights battles. They don’t want to
restore legal segregation, they want to relitigate how it was
disassembled. Similarly, there are people who wish to start over from
the beginning of the 20th century. They look at American participation
in the two great industrial wars as a tragic error. Of course, there are
some who would like to start over in the 1930’s and reargue the case for
fascism.

From the perspective of political philosophy, the revanchists are the
most authentically right-wing because they reject the product of
left-wing progress. The conventional right-wing tribes always find some
way to accommodate the latest innovations. They also embrace liberal
democracy, which the revanchists reject. The revanchists of all types
assume a hierarchical society, so they reject the egalitarianism of the
modernity, which means they reject the foundations of liberal democracy.

The final tribe of the Right is the Dissident Right. They share many of
the aims of the other groups, but they arrive at their conclusions for
unique reasons. To be a genuine dissident is to reject the moral
philosophy of this age, but also replace it with a moral philosophy
rooted in the material reality of nature. For the Dissident, the
mysticism of Julius Evola is just as ridiculous as the utopianism of
Karl Marx. Philosophy is, for the most part, a form of escapism.

*Biologism* is not new, and it has been denounced by philosophy for its
reliance on accuracy over aspiration but advances in the human science
continue to boost the argument for a moral philosophy rooted in
biological realty. Psychology, for example, has given way to chemistry
in the treatment of mental illness. Evolutionary reality could one day
be the antidote to the psychosis of the modern West. While by far the
smallest tribe on the Right, the Dissident Right has a future.

The interesting question that perhaps underlies the panic of the Western
establishment is where will those large tribes of people migrate to when
they become disillusioned with the prevailing orthodoxy. Since the
establishment only sees good guys and bad guys and the revanchists are
all too happy to don the black hat, it makes sense why they fear the
various bogeymen of the revanchist camp. Defenders of liberal democracy
frame everything as democracy versus Hitler for this reason.

The bet by Dissidents is that realty still has some role to play in the
life of the West and those disgruntled and disillusioned will at least
entertain an alternative rooted in the natural reality of mankind.
Alternatively, the various tribes of the Right will see that going
backwards is not an option, so moving forward into a moral philosophy
rooted in natural realty, however imperfect and incomplete, is the only
option. In this regard, the Dissident Right is the optimism tribe on the
Right.

The important takeaway from this survey of the Right is that the
overwhelming majority of the people under a banner on the Right are
still attached to the liberal order. They still believe they can vote
their way out of the defects of democracy. There is a reason this point
of view remains the most compelling. It offers hope. Reality and
alternative fantasy have never held up well to the subtle utopianism of
liberal democracy. That is a realty of the Right that Dissidents would
be wise to explore.
