**Note:** I have a
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/278172" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">new post</a> up behind the green door. I’m buy a car,
which I hate more than just about anything, so I will be posting about
that experience for donors. Given my loathing of car buying, it will be
an adventure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the first lessons in economics is that demand drives supply. The
more a product or service is desired, the greater the supply of it,
barring some artificial constraint on supply. The relationship between
supply and demand is expressed in the price for the good or service. A
rising price means demand is outpacing supply and a falling price means
supply is outpacing demand. If demand falls low enough, supply will
disappear as there is no profit to be made in the transaction.

Supply and demand used to be an article of faith in capitalist
countries, but it seems that our rulers have abandoned that axiom. Take
for example labor markets. They insist that flooding the American labor
market with new people from abroad will lift wages and increase
employment. All that diversity will cancel out the collapse in demand
relative to supply and something will happen. With regards to the labor
market, the new article of faith is that unlimited supply drives up
demand somehow.

Now, a lot of people think this new universal truth about the labor
markets is just a trick to fool people into voting away their
inheritance. Collusion between the cheap labor lobby and the cheap voter
lobby has resulted in this weird libertarian argument that the old
axioms about supply and demand do not apply to labor markets. That way
heritage Americans will not resist the flood of foreigners into their
country. That could be true, but it is not an isolated example of this
new economic law.

You may have noticed that the car makers are making a big splash by
announcing they will abandon the internal combustion engine within the
next decade or so. <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/jaguar-go-fully-electric-2025"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jaguar</a> is the latest car maker to say
they will stop making normal cars within the decade. They say they will
be fully electric by 2025, which is not far off. Other carmakers have
been less aggressive in their target date, but the general consensus is
that all of them will be electric-only within the next decade.

The question no one asks is why? The embrace of electric cars has been
tepid in the United States and Europe. They are an interesting
experiment. If you are the sort that likes owning a novelty product,
then buying a Tesla is an option. The government literally pays you to
buy one, so there is that. Even so, the demand has not been great,
because there is not great need for electric cars. For most people, a
car is a tool and the current internal combustion models do the job
perfectly well.

Then there is the fact that it is a terribly impractical thing to own at
this time, as there are few charging stations and charging takes too
long. More than half of US drivers cannot have a charging station at
home, because they live in a rental unit. Many homeowners cannot have
one because of the cost or their homes are not capable of having one
installed. Then there is the power grid. Estimates range from $4 to $10
trillion to upgrade the power grid for electric cars.

This is of no concern to our rulers. They are sure that if they crank up
the supply side the demand side will do something and then something
else will happen and before long the roads are full of electric cars.
Now, some will claim that these announcements are just like Soviet
five-year plans. They are not realistic targets and the people behind
them have no intention of doing what they claim. In other words, they
still accept the laws of supply and demand, they just like lying.

Maybe that is true. The fake meat business, on the other hand, suggests
they really believe the new economic model. Five years ago, the number
of people walking around demanding a burger made from beetles that
tasted just like a burger was zero. We have vegans and vegetarians, for
sure, but we also have schizophrenics and manic depressives too.
Mentally ill people are a part of the human condition. Normal people
want to eat a balanced diet that includes meat.

Despite zero demand for meat made from grass and insects, the
“Impossible Meat” racket is picking up steam. The billionaires are
getting in on the racket and the Davos crowd is telling politicians it
is the future. In fairness, the fake meat is not revolting, but that is
not the threshold. Cat food does not taste terrible under the right
conditions, but people do not want to eat that either. Fake meat is the
e-book of the food business, in that it is a solution is search of a
problem that was solved long ago.

These are some big recent examples, but they are part of a general trend
in which the overclass abandons the laws of supply and demand. Given
that market capitalism starts with supply and demand, it may be that we
are now post-market societies. We are becoming something like a
high-tech version of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">palace economy</a>. This was a common way to distribute
goods in the Bronze Age. Given that the managerial class has a
distinctive Bronze Age quality, it makes perfect sense.

On the other hand, supply driven economics has a poor history. In the
1970’s the great and the good pulled out all the stops to impose the
metric system on America, but it was a complete failure. No demand meant
no acceptance. The same is true of soccer and women’s sports. For half a
century the great and good have been pushing these on Americans, but
they remain fringe interests. Those iron laws of supply and demand, like
reality itself, are resistant to wishful thinking.

The other side of this is that the people pushing these fads know this
and believe they can warp reality to their will, or they are lying.
Jaguar marketing is probably packed to the gills with the sort of people
who live in whites-only neighborhoods, but demand the company bring in
Robin DiAngelo to lecture them about their privilege. Fake meat and
electric cars are just the latest boutique moral signifiers. Another
turn of the wheel and some other fad will fill this role.

Of course, this raises an important question. Is it better to be ruled
by maniacs who think reality is an optical illusion or is it better to
be ruled by a class of sociopaths willing to lie about everything? From
a moral perspective, the former is worse because they really believe in
their cause. There is no reasoning with a fanatic. On the other hand,
can you reason with a pathological liar? How can you know? These
questions suggest that the real supply problem is at the top.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
