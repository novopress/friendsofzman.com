Back in the old days at the birth of the Internet, the place for
technical people to gather on-line was the bulletin board. You dialed in
with your modem and logged into a bulletin board to read posting from
others and engage in debate with others of similar interests. I think
the first BBS I logged into was a college football site. Not long after
e-mail lists came along and then NNTP servers. This was the first
“social networking” and was for nerds only. You had to know stuff to get
on-line. Today, even
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/barackobama" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">retarded people have Facebook pages</a>.

Now that the Hive is on-line, they have co-opted the language of the
Internet. It used to be that a “troll” was someone who posted to get
attention. Someone would post on a college football newsgroup, for
example, that Miami was a school for thugs and drug dealers. A big
argument would erupt allowing the troll to irritate a bunch of people.
“Trolling” was a way to stir up trouble. Clever trolling has produced
some of the most amusing bits on the Internet.

Now, the Hive has redefined the term to mean “people they don’t like.”
Anyone who holds an opinion contrary to the Cult approved opinions is
called a troll. Like Nazi and racist, it no longer has meaning. But, it
also means the person so labeled has no meaning. <a

*London (AFP) – The death of a British woman accused of a vicious
campaign of online abuse against the parents of missing girl Madeleine
McCann has ignited debate over the growing scourge of Internet
“trolls”.*

*Brenda Leyland was found dead in a hotel room earlier this month after
being confronted by Sky News over her alleged trolling of Kate and Gerry
McCann, whose three-year-old daughter went missing in Portugal in 2007.*

*An investigation is ongoing, but has found no evidence of foul play or
third party involvement.*

*Using the Twitter handle @Sweepyface the 63-year-old reportedly posted
thousands of hate-filled messages about the couple.*

*Her name figured on an 80-page dossier compiled by members of the
public cataloguing alleged abuse directed at the couple and their two
other children from a long list of Internet users, which is currently
being investigated by the police.*

*It is a trend that has been replicated the world over against
high-profile figures.*

Brenda Leyland was not “trolling” anyone. She was most likely a nut who
was harassing people. The abracadabra phrase “hate-filled” tells you
that the couple she was harassing were members of the Cult. Noticing the
obvious about the Cult is always hate-filled so I’m just connecting the
dots.

Think about the mindset of the people who came together to compile the
dossier on the dead woman. These are the sort of people who turned in
Jews to the Nazi occupiers in France.
