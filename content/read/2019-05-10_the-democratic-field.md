I like to try out new things once in a while, mostly because I’m still
not sure what works best for this type of podcast. Writing is a
different experience than speaking. What works for a blog post will not
work for a podcast. The old saying in legacy media is that radio is a
hot medium and television is a cool medium. That is, you need to be
fierier on radio to keep an audience, while on television you need to be
calmer. No one wants to see a madman ranting and raving in their living
room, so you have to appear calm.

I suspect the same rules apply to new media. Within the podcast domain,
some things will work better than others, because the media is more
intimate. Most people consume this product by their lonesome. That’s why
I try new things all the time. I’m figuring out what works in this
format and what I like doing. This week, for example, I’m breaking from
the normal format to run through all of the Democrat candidates. No
breaks. It’s also a much more casual show than normal. These freaks are
too weird to take them seriously.

That really is the thing that jumps out when you start looking at these
people and their campaigns. None of them should be dog catcher in a
small town. It’s ridiculous that any of them running for President. I
suspect when the revolution comes, the reason will be that decent people
simply got fed up pretending that this stuff is anything but an insult
to the dignity of the people. The other thing is this is highly
orchestrated. The system actively selects for these people. This freak
show is what our rulers want to see.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
