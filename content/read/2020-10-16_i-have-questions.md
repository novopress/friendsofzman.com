Over the last five years I have kept circling back to something the
neoliberal pundit Mickey Kaus observed during the 2016 GOP primary. He
said they could easily have co-opted much of the Trump vote if the
candidates had moved just a little bit in his direction on immigration
and trade. Instead, their reaction to his rather mild observations and
proposals was to race in the other direction. It made the gap between
Trump and the rest of the field much more obvious to the voters.

The question he had then, one that still resonates today, is why did
they do the exact opposite of what politics demands? The spergs come in
at this point and provide charts and graphs on the cheap labor lobbies
or how immigrants are turning states like Texas into California. There’s
that old right-wing need to believe that all people are rational, so
there must be a practical explanation for all behavior. In the case of
the 2016 primary, it means the donors made the candidates go the wrong
way.

That’s just wishful thinking. A defect of the conventional Right is that
is deeply believes they will one day find the combination of words that
unlocks the secret of the Progressive mind, making it amenable to
reason. One day, some bright conservative will say something so profound
that the Left will stop, throw down their weapons and twirl their
mustaches in astonishment. Then they will embrace their conservative
brothers in a fellowship of reason and republican virtue.

The current year should put that to rest. Look around and it is hard to
find any evidence of rational self-interest at work. We have a
legitimate drug crisis in America and the people in charge refuse to
even discuss it. It’s not because they have good reason to ignore it or
they are afraid to address it. Trump mentioned the subject and they
began to hiss like demons being shown a crucifix. It was if he violated
some sacred taboo by pointing out the very obvious problems we have with
drugs.

It is not just the drug issue, which certainly has some uncomfortable
facets to it for a society steeped in multicultural oogily-boogily. Free
speech used to be one issue that all sides of the political debate would
defend unconditionally. Even those who thought adult material should be
restricted to adults opposed bans on speech. Today, it is hard to find
anyone in any corner of the political debate defending speech. The
free-speech champions are the people called Nazis by the beautiful
people.

You can go around the wheel of practical politics and issue after issue
reveals that our ruling class and a big chunk the public has gone
insane. The Biden scandal is a great example of the lunacy. Major news
outlets are now weaving conspiracy theories in which Russians are behind
this laptop. Within living memory the defense would have been, “What can
you do? His kid turned out to be a loser.” Today, the defense is a
bizarre conspiracy that reads like a movie script.

It is possible that this is just what societal breakdown looks like from
the inside when you are experiencing in real-time. Maybe Russians looked
around at each other at the end, wondering if their rulers had lost
their minds. Maybe French peasants begin to wonder if their lord was
possessed by the devil. No one records the thoughts and ruminations of
the Dirt People. History is the story of Cloud People. This could just
be what it is like to be a peasant at the end of days.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
