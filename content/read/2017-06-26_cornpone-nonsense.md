A long time ago, I decided I would just ignore the intelligent design
people. I’m perfectly fine leaving them to their beliefs, as I don’t
think it causes any harm for people to believe in a supernatural
designer. In fact, I feel the same way about creationists. There’s no
harm in it and if it brings people some peace and comfort, that seems
like a good thing. The reason I will not debate evolution with them,
however, is that intelligent design people rarely argue in good faith.
They engage in sophistry and logical fallacies, rather than honest
debate.

ID’ers will often misrepresent some bit of science, in order to
discredit it, and by extension, everything they claim rests upon it.
The thermodynamics and entropy argument that was popular with them for a
while was a grossly inaccurate interpretation of the science and a
faulty application of it. order cannot arise from disorder.By the time
you corrected them, they were onto some other half-baked claim. It is
simply a waste of time debating them as they just keep moving the goal
posts, demanding you prove them wrong.

Anyway, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">this steaming pile of nonsense</a> from
Fred Reed the other day reminds me a lot of the way ID’ers attack
evolution. If I recall, Reed is a flat earth guy, so it is probably a
habit of mind that puts ID’er and IQ denialists in the same pew.

This Gomer Pyle routine has always been a part of his act. It’s a form
of intellectual base stealing where the writer gets to declare the
subject, upon which he intends to opine, is easily reduced to folk
wisdom. The author is the folksiest of folk wizards, so that means he
can be an expert on the countrified version of the topic. He also likes
playing the Jon Stewart game of wearing the serious mask when
criticizing others, but then donning the clown mask when receiving
criticism. In Reed’s case, it is “Ah shucks fellers, I’m just a simple
country boy. Why are you sore with me?”

This is a good example of what ID’ers like doing when attacking
evolution. It is the false concession. He appears to be conceding that
iQ is not cultural, but in reality he is saying it is not magic.  What
Reed is describing, with regards to Newton, is not culture. It is magic.
Culture is the highly complex feedback loop that evolved over time among
a group of people with a shared heritage and biology. Mere proximity
does not mean culture. That’s just a version of Magic Dirt Theory. No
one would call that culture.

Notice the Hillary gag. He knows his readers are not Hillary voters so
he attempts to discredit the idea of intelligence, by pointing out that,
according to standardized testing, Clinton is intelligent. “How ’bout
that fellers? These pin-headed IQ people are so dumb they they think
that fat commie Hillary Clinton is smart! Shazam!” It is a way to get
the reader to accept a point that the writer was never able, or never
bothered, to prove. It’s basically guilt by association.

Notice also the subtle confusion of the idea of shared group traits.
When people in the cognitive sciences talk about shared traits, they
mean biological groups, not social groups or arbitrary categories like
Nobel Prize winners. The implication of what Reed is claiming here is
that sub-Saharan Africans, for example, are just a random a collection
of people like the local PTA or Rotary Club. That’s absurd. They are
people with a shared biological heritage and as a result, a shared sent
of traits that evolved in Africa.

This fits in well with the last line where he claims you can know
something exists, without measuring it. This is complete nonsense. We
cannot know something exists without having some evidence of it. Seeing
a a mysterious animal may not tell us much, but it is data of an animal.
How accurately we can measure a thing like IQ or height or weight is the
question, not whether we can measure it. Of course, what he is trying to
slip in here is the assertion that just because something can be
measured does not mean it exists.

This is a bit of folk nonsense popular with people who have no idea how
intelligence testing is constructed. Test designers have understood for
generations that guys like Fred Reed will try to game the test. People
who have done a lot of test administration learn that people in the high
normal range really worry that they are just in the normal range, rather
than some level of genius. Therefore, they will be the ones who are the
least honest in test taking. That’s why the tests are designed to
mitigate this observed phenomenon.

The most common way of defeating the scheme Fred thinks is effective is
to make the exams progressively more difficult. Therefore, running
through and answering the easy ones just means you get frustrated
quickly as you find fewer and fewer cherries to pick from the exam. Some
tests are designed such that non-consecutive answers will be discarded.
These days, test takers will use a computer and not have the ability to
skip ahead looking for easy questions, even if they think it will work.

This is a what is called a lie. Yes, some standardized tests correlate
with IQ tests in narrow areas, but exactly no one in the cognitive
sciences thinks the SAT is a surrogate for an intelligence test. As for
the claim regarding cultural bias, that’s always been nonsense, as
anyone who has taken the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Raven’s Progressive Matrices</a> would
know. When researchers look at IQ among groups, they specifically use
these sorts of exams. Here’s a short presentation on IQ testing in
Africa for those interested.

Like those ID’ers I referenced at the start of this post, Fred has the
habit of assuming that his position must be right if the alternative is
not proved beyond all doubt. If evolutionary biology has not answered
all of his questions to his satisfaction, then it must all be wrong and
his brand of oogily-boogily is correct. Similarly, because there are
lots of things we don’t know about IQ, he feels free to dismiss all of
it, even the stuff that is correct.

What’s objectionable about Fred Reed is not the sugar-coated goober
routine that he lays on so thick it gives you cavities. That’s tolerable
if it is sincere. When he gets into these topics, there is a distinct
lack of authenticity. There’s a meanness to his approach, as if he is
bitter at not being able to keep up with the crowd, so he invests his
time in trying to prove there’s no reason to bother. Regardless of the
motivations, his brand of cornpone nonsense is exactly that, nonsense.
