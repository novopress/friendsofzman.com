rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I’ve been following this
case</a> for a while and I keep wondering why no one is in jail, even
though I know the answer. There’s little doubt that major figures in
tech were engaged in illegal activity. It is also clear, by the way,
that their lust for H1B1 visas is just an attempt to suppress wages.
This is the sort of thing they make movies about, with the hot shot
lawyer and the whistle blower finally beating the bad guys.

*There is “ample evidence” that Silicon Valley was engaged in “an
overarching conspiracy” against its own employees, a federal judge said
on Friday, and it should either pay dearly or have its secrets exposed
at trial.*

*Judge Lucy H. Koh of the United States District Court in San Jose
rejected as insufficient a proposed $324 million settlement in a
class-action antitrust case that accused leading tech companies of
agreeing not to poach one another’s engineers.*

*In addition, her decision immediately resuscitated a public relations
nightmare for Google, Apple and other top tech companies while
vindicating a range of observers — including one of the plaintiffs in
the suit — who said Silicon Valley was escaping justice.*

*With the case once again heading to trial, it threatens to expose to
further scrutiny the business practices of Steve Jobs of Apple. The
blunt emails of Mr. Jobs, an unquestioned genius, could prove to be his
company’s undoing.*

Steve Jobs was a horrible human being. If the Christians are right,
Steve Jobs is being sodomized by Hitler and Stalin in Hell right now. He
screwed his employees, treated everyone including his family like
garbage and he was a pathological liar and confidence man. Maybe that
finally gets a full airing in a courtroom. Too bad the cocksucker is
dead.
