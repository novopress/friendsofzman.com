Way back in the olden thymes when everyone thought buffalo was food, not
a crappy sports town, men hunted the mammoth and said horrible things to
one another on dial-up bulletin boards. This was not only before the
iPhone (Gasp!), but before Windows, when computing required more than a
third grade education. In those days, arguments were settled by using
outlandish insults.

I wish I had a nickel for every time I told some douche-bag to chug down
a frothy glass of Drano. The acronym DIAF was created because it was so
commonly used. If someone really pissed you off, you would tell them to
go home, shoot their family and then shoot themselves, in order to clean
up the gene pool. Now, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can go to jail in New Zealand for
that sort of thing</a>.

*Internet trolls face up to two years’ jail in New Zealand under a
controversial new law which bans “harmful digital communications”.*

*And under a parallel amendment to New Zealand’s Crimes Act, a person
who tells another to kill themselves faces up to three years in prison.*

*The law will help mitigate the harm caused by cyber-bulling and give
victims a quick and effective means of redress, supporters said.*

*But critics said the law harms free speech and its fine print could
threaten public interest journalism in the country.*

*Under the Harmful Digital Communications Act in effect from this week,
anyone convicted of “causing harm by posting digital communication”
faces two years in prison and a $50,000 (NZ) (£6,500) fine, while
businesses face fines of up to $200,000 (NZ).*

*Harmful communications can include truthful as well as false
information, and “intimate visual recordings” such as nude or seminude
pictures or video shared without permission.*

One of the consequences of being ruled by stupid people is they get
pretty much everything wrong. The term “troll” does not mean a
supernatural beings that dwell in isolated rocks, mountains and caves.
It means people who posted things to get attention, as in “trolling for
attention.”

Putting that aside, this is insane and the people who came up with it
should die in a fire. Imagine the court hearing for some one accused of
being a troll. It’s the sort of thing you would expect to see in the day
room of the asylum. You get sent to prison and instantly become the
baddest guy on the yard because you told some douche to drink poison.

We’re so doomed.
