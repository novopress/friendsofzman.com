It may not seem like it at the moment, but it is a good chance that we
are witnessing the twilight of the neocons. For half a century they have
dominated the conservative movement and the Republican Party. They ran
both into the ground in the Bush years and then abandoned ship when
Trump came along. They found a purchase in the Biden administration, but
that will not be long lived.

At some point, the sober minded in both parties will come to see the
neocons as a cancer that must be removed as a matter of survival. That
and it is clear the neocon subculture is lacking in talent. The second
generation has proven to be quite stupid, and the next generation makes
Ocasio-Cortez look like a scholar. It is shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves
in three generations for the neocons.

Even so, it is important to understand how this deranged cult of people
managed to gain so much power in the 20th century. Lots of people have
grand ideas about where to go from here, but none of them can be taken
seriously unless they incorporate an understanding for how we got here.
There are important lessons for contemporary politics in the story of
the neocons.

That is the show this week. It is a primer on the events that made the
environment that spawned the neoconservative movement and how this
collection of neurotic losers managed to rise to the top of the
political order. Neoconservatism is a uniquely American phenomenon that
speaks to the uniquely American problems we will face in the demographic
age.
