Montesquieu observed that each form of political system had what he
called a spring, but what we would call a mindset, that animated the
people. For example, in aristocratic systems the people were motivated
by honor. You wanted to please the man you served, so you were loyal to
him. In a republican system, the citizens were loyal to the institutions
and processes. You served the office, rather than the man. Tyrants, of
course, relied upon the fear of the people.

Democracy was not mentioned and liberal democracy as we understand it
did not exist, so Montesquieu did not have a spring for these. What we
think we know about Athenian society tells us that morality was the
spring of their democracy. The people were motivated by what they
understand to be the shared beliefs of the people. In fact, Socrates was
put on trial for impiety. He questioned the generally held beliefs of
the people, which was viewed as a threat to order.

Managerialism was not something Montesquieu could discuss, because it
did not exist until long after his time, but we can see it operates a
lot like democracy. As with democracy, there is the need for consensus.
Dissent is viewed with suspicion as it calls into question the
majority’s sense that they are acting in the best interests of the whole
of society. Therefore, everyone seeks to be viewed as pious, the more
pious the better, so it is a race to the center of the consensus.

The thing is, this is not a front brain activity. People are not looking
around on every issue, counting noses and anticipating the majority.
Instead it is an instinctual thing, arrived at by interacting with the
people in close proximity. It is why the metaphor of the hive is so
important. Like drones in a hive, the people in the managerial class do
not know why they believe what they believe. They just know everyone
they know supports men in dresses, so it must be the right thing to do.

We have a couple of good recent examples from the courts. In theory,
this is where kooky beliefs like transgenderism should slam into
reality. The courts exist only because they operate upon fixed rules.
Even the subversives of the legal profession acknowledge that it is a
rules-based system, even as they gnaw away at those rules with clever
manipulation of the language. The law is rules and without rules there
is no law, so this should be the graveyard of belief.

In the case of the Proud Boys, who are being charged with trying to
overthrow the government, the FBI accidently
<a href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/03/14/a-spill-of-fbi-secrets/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that they had been actively
working to destroy exculpatory evidence and frame the defendants. In
most cases, this would have resulted in the case being dismissed with
prejudice. In some cases, the defense would simply use it to destroy the
credibility of the state. In this case, the judge is
[preventing](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-denies-requests-jan-6-defendants-cross-examine-fbi-agent-leaked-messages)
the defense from using this in their defense.

In a related case, Douglas Mackey, the man behind the infamous Twitter
account Ricky Vaughn, is on trial for being funny at the expense of
Hillary Clinton. The judge in the case has denied the defense the right
to confront his accuser. There is a secret witness that the defense is
barred from knowing about in advance. More importantly, the judge has
laughed off a clear case of [witness
intimidation](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1635718422246850581.html)
by the state. Apparently, prosecutors had the SPLC harass a defense
witness.

This is not the first time we have seen federal judges throw the law out
the window in order to persecute people with beliefs contrary to the
ruling consensus. The judge in the Michael Flynn case went to the
Supreme Court demanding the right to be both judge and prosecutor in
that trial. In fact, this is becoming so common it is right to view the
federal system as something like Sharia courts. The written law and the
traditions behind it are unimportant. Managerial morality is the
standard.

The reason for this is the people who exist in these systems feel they
must be seen as pious by everyone else in the system. If you are a judge
providing a fair trial for the Proud Boys or Douglas Mackey, you are
suspect. Your friends and associates in the system will begin to
question your commitment. After all, everyone knows these are bad people
who must be punished. A judge that allows for these bad people to avoid
punishment could be viewed as a bad person.

The way to understand what is happening is to imagine a religious cult
taking over the primary institutions of society. Imagine if the
Scientologists gained control of the judiciary and started demanding
thetan readings in court. The irrationality of thetan levels is
unimportant. The people who believe it are not about to be talked out of
it and even if that was possible, the selection pressure favors
believers. Therefore, faking it has far more benefit than questioning
it.

This is why facts and reason have no role in our debates. The people in
charge either believe the current fads or they are pretending to believe
them because that is what is required for membership in their portion of
the polyarchy. Judges burn law books, carnies burn Bibles and
politicians burn the Constitution not because they are destroyers, but
because the system requires it. If the system needs the Bible, then they
will quickly become Bible defenders.

Another troubling fact about the current crisis is that the existence of
this hive mentality atop the system shows that the current structure of
our cultural, political and economic universe is what makes this outcome
possible. Make a small change in how America evolved in the 20th century
and we get a vastly different result. What this means is changing the
people gets more of the same, even more extreme results, because the
system is tuned to produce the hive mind.

Much in the same way that the end of the aristocratic order required the
French Revolution and the American Revolution, the end of this crisis in
the West means erasing the history that made this system possible.
Revolution puts a period on a historical process and begins a new
process. The end of managerial polyarchy requires the repudiation of the
history that created it. The system and the process that created it is
the enemy, not the people in it.
