It is easy to see why sensible people choose to vote Republican. Despair
is a sin and something to be avoided, whenever possible. Trudging off to
vote for the least dangerous option at least offers the hope of
postponing the bitter end for a little while longer. At the same time,
you cannot blame people for thinking that a vote for the GOP is a vote
for prolonging the agony. Look at <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">this story</a> from New Hampshire.

*Stephanopoulos will be hosting Thursday night’s debate between former
Sen. Scott Brown and Shaheen, despite this conflict—he’s on video as a
political activist accepting Shaheen’s endorsement of President
Clinton—and another conflict. As <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breitbart News reported on Tuesday</a>,
Stephanopoulos has a longtime personal and political relationship with
Shaheen campaign adviser Mandy Grunwald.*

*Stephanopoulos has a history of flubbing debates, and he is widely
credited with creating the “war on women” in a 2012 GOP primary
debate—inserting the issue of contraception into the debate when nobody
was discussing it at all.*

Why in the world do these people keep falling for the same gags?
Stephanopoulos was a prominent Clinton rump-swab and the chief toady for
years. Brown may as well have agreed to have Wasserman-Schultz moderate
the debate. Maybe she was busy. How about Shaheen’s husband? How about
Brown agree to be blindfolded and gagged for the debate so he cannot
respond?

This happens all the time with the GOP. Romney signed off on the obese
woman from CNN moderating a debate, despite her being a far leftist. Her
lunging to the defense of Obama in the debate may very well have saved
the day for Obama. Instead of talking about Obama’s defects, the post
debate coverage was about the moderator slapping Mitt around at the end.
It is why they are called The Stupid Party.
