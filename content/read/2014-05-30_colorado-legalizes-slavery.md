In celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, <a
href="http://news.yahoo.com/panel-baker-must-cakes-gay-weddings-172619256.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Colorado has brought back
slavery</a>. Some weird Stalinist court has ordered Jack Phillips to
work for two men against his will.

*Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission on Friday ordered a baker to make
wedding cakes for same-sex couples, finding his religious objections to
the practice did not trump the state’s anti-discrimination statutes.*

*The unanimous ruling from the seven-member commission upheld an
administrative law judge’s finding in December that Jack Phillips
violated civil rights law when he refused to make a wedding cake for a
gay couple in 2012. The couple sued.*

*“I can believe anything I want, but if I’m going to do business here,
I’d ought to not discriminate against people,” Commissioner Raju Jaram
said.*

*Phillips, a devout Christian who owns the Masterpiece Cakeshop in the
Denver suburb of Lakewood, said the decision violates his First
Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of his religion. “I
will stand by my convictions until somebody shuts me down,” he told
reporters after the ruling.*

*He added his bakery has been so overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy
cookies and brownies that he does not currently make wedding cakes.*

*The couple who sued Phillips, Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig, were
pleased that the commission roundly rejected Phillips’ arguments. “We’re
just thrilled by that,” Mullins said.*

Phillips should make a cake in the shape of <a

the perverts happy.
