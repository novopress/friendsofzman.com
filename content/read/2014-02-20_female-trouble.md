The awfulness of feminism was not always obvious. The “first wave” of
feminism, conveniently called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-wave feminism</a>, was
about women getting the vote and some legal protections. A lot of men
knew giving women the vote was a bad idea, but not so bad that they were
willing to fight to stop it. A century ago when women were demanding the
vote, feminism did not look like an assault on nature. It was just
unattractive women making a nuisance of themselves in public.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Second-wave feminism</a> is
where the nuttiness bobbed above the water line. That’s where we get
words like “gender” worming their way into our vocabulary. That is, sex
is an arbitrary construct created by men to oppress women. The remedy
was to smash up family life, give women a handful of rubbers and money
for cab fare as dating aids and demand that men stop thinking about sex.
That sounds crude, but crudeness was the most obvious feature of second
wave feminism in the 60’s and 70’s.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Third-wave feminism</a> takes
this to another level of crazy where reality is infinitely negotiable.
Here we get a variety of new sexes, claims about women being witches
from another planet and the sun revolves around the earth. That sounds
like mockery, but it is hard to satire this stuff. When people are
claiming the biology is not just a social construct, but part of a grand
conspiracy, it’s hard to not mock it. Despite this, the lunacy has just
started. Soon, men will be afraid to around women in the office or even
in public.

Crazy rants against nature in the abstract are one thing. Sitting in
your college office ranting about males has a different result than
throwing yourself off the roof claiming you can fly. But, the crazy
rants eventually lead to someone testing the theory. The insanity of
feminism is now showing up in the emergency rooms of America as women
and girls test the theory that there is no biological difference between
men and women. At the Olympics, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/sports/olympics/extreme-park-crashes-taking-outsize-toll-on-women.html?hpw&amp;rref=sports&amp;_r=0"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">girls competing on courses
built for men</a> are getting hurt a lot.

*Sarka Pancochova, a Czech snowboarder, led the slopestyle event after
the first run. On her second trip down the course of obstacles and
jumps, she flew through the air, performed a high-arcing, spinning trick
and smacked her head upon landing. Her limp body spun like a propeller
into the gully between jumps and slid to a stop.*

*Pancochova was soon on her feet, and the uneasy crowd cheered. Her
helmet was cracked nearly in half, back to front.*

*She was one of the lucky ones, seemingly O.K., but her crash last week
was indicative of a bigger issue: a messy collage of violent wipeouts at
these Olympics. Most of the accidents have occurred at the Rosa Khutor
Extreme Park, the site of the snowboarding and freestyle skiing events
like halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls.*

*And most of the injuries have been sustained by women.*

The rants against nature are not just showing up in silly snow
activities. The US military is <a
href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/#ixzz2IvsAlqCM"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">putting women in combat
units</a>. It is one thing for a gal to break her neck trying to ski
like a boy. It is unfortunate and sad, but not the end of the world for
anyone but her. Putting physically and mentally inferior soldiers into
combat units is another matter. That’s where mother nature let’s you
know reality is not negotiable. Men in combat have a way to handle the
physically and mentally unfit within their ranks.

Women are not men. Men are bigger, faster and stronger than women.
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2151965"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Studies</a> have
been conducted using the mountain of data collected by the military over
the last 100 years. One of the ancillary benefits of having a massive
standing army is a massive amount of data about the humans entering and
serving in that standing army. It provides the best cross-section of the
American population possible. Since America is a mixed society, it works
as a handy proxy for the human race in general.

*“Using the standard Army Physical Fitness Test … the upper quintile of
women at West Point achieved scores on the test equivalent to the bottom
quintile of men.”*

West Point is a training center for the very best who are willing to
join the Army. What the data shows is the best women are physically the
same as the very worst men. That may not sound so bad, but according to
the data, “the average 20-to-30 year-old woman has the same aerobic
capacity as a 50 year-old man.” Anyone who has played sports, goes to
the gym or lived on earth knows this is fairly obvious. There is a
reason why girls don’t play football and boys are not allowed to play in
women’s sports.

There’s another bit to this. Women and men think differently too. For
instance, <a href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/SexDifferences.aspx"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there are differences in
IQ</a>. Males are over represented in fields like math and science, but
under represented in nurturing professions like education and medicine.
The <a
href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/male-brain-vs-female-brain-i"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">difference between men and
women</a> show up across the range of human attributes. Men and women
are *different* and they are *complimentary*. For all of human history,
people, both sexes, understood and excepted this.
