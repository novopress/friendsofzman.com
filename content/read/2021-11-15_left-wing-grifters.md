**Note:** The regular Monday Taki

present state to the old Soviet Union. Behind the

A popular topic on this side of the great divide is who is and who is
not a grifter, a shill or controlled opposition. The general assumption
is that the people with perches in Conservative Inc. are working some
sort of con. Maybe their racket is to keep people from looking over the
great divide. These are the gatekeepers. Others may co-opt a dissident
idea and then neuter it. They say things like Critical Race Theory is
actually an attack on nonwhites so white people can oppose it.

Often forgotten is that the other side has their fair share of grifters
who make a comfortable living working the true believers. Here is an <a
href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/could-chris-christie-and-liz-cheney-take-trump-down"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a> from the Daily Beast of what
can be called woo-woo for the wokies. The writer is telling them that
their newly minted hero, Liz Cheney, and an old has-been named Chris
Christie, will give Trump a run for his money in the 2024 Republican
primary. The Twitter
<a href="https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/1459746606874607616"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread</a> on this topic is an amusing
window into political mental illness.

The writer is someone calling himself
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_K._Lewis" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Matt Lewis</a>. He used to play the role of snarky
conservative, but that was just an act. At a young age he was harvested
and cultivated by the neoconservatives. When the fortunes of the neocons
faded, he did what all rats do on a sinking ship. He now peddles his
wares as a reformed conservative to a gullible audience at the Daily
Beast. It is a trip that so many have made that it has become a stock
figure in the American political drama.

As you see with the grifters of Conservative Inc., the left-wing variety
sells the true believers the latest items from the one true faith. In
this case the item for sale is that Liz Cheney is a folk hero for
finking on her party and her voters. She has signed onto the
Stalin-esque show trial called the January 6 Commission. This is where
the Left gets to claim that normal white people exercising their ancient
rights are white supremacist insurrectionists and a threat to “our
democracy”.

The main difference between the woke grifters and the conservative
grifters is the former works in a world of pure imagination. Say what
you want about Ben Shapiro, but he is not wrong about the
“constitutional principle” business. If we had a ruling class that
enforced the old rules, things would be better for everyone. His grift
lies in convincing people that it is still possible with this ruling
class. He turns a virtue into the vice of defending the enemies of the
people.

Because the left-wing grifter operates in the world of fantasy, he has
an easier time of it, but is barred from factual reality. At some level,
they must believe the same nonsense as their intended suckers. In the
case of neocons like Matt Lewis, he harbors the same hatred for the
white people as the true believers. The neocons may be driven by
hyperviolent fantasies about world conquest, but they also detest the
heritage population every bit as much as the wokest wokie.

It is that blind hatred that allows the crazies to now embrace Liz
Cheney. You have to admire the skill with which the neocons have
ingratiated themselves with their old friends on the Left. Not long ago
the name “Cheney” was spelled H-i-t-l-e-r by the readers of the Daily
Beast. He was the master of the Haliburton Hurricane Machine that
devastated New Orleans and unleashed hell on the Arabs. It requires a
special brand of crazy to do a heel turn like that in such a short time.

Of course, what wads a lot of this together into a slimy ball of hatred
for the average American is a sense of class consciousness. The new
religion is the religion of the new class, the managerial class that now
commands the high ground. The middling celebrities of the commentariat
are driven as much by their duty to their own class as they are by
genuine belief. To people like Matt Lewis, those Trump voters outside
the hive walls are a threat to his people.

It is completely bonkers that anyone would think that Liz Cheney has a
future in Republican politics. That is one of those bits of good news, a
little green shoot, that should give the good guys a little hope. The
people on the other side are increasingly driven mad by the
contradictions of their new religion. If the good guys could create and
insert chaos agents into the system, Liz Cheney would be a good example.
Every time she speaks in public, another dissident is born.

Another bit of good news in stories like this is that the
neoconservatives have really fallen on hard times. That cabal now exists
on an island off the coasty of crazy-ville, supported by a billionaire
Persian who thinks he may be Cyrus the Great. The second generation of
neocons squandered the tribal fortune and the third generation makes the
Kennedy gene pool like deep. Like so much of the managerial class,
neoconservatism now reeks of its own decay.
