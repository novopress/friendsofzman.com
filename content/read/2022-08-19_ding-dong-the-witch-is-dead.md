I must admit that I have enjoyed the blow out loss of Liz Cheney much
more than I expected to enjoy it. It has been known for a long time that
she was going to lose her race, but somehow the Cloud People were not
ready for it. They have been carrying on like this is a bolt from the
blue. I suspect the midnight miracle of 2020 convinced them that if they
wished hard enough, their election dreams will come true.

That has been the best part of it. The people bemoaning the result are
the worst people and they are not hiding it. By worst people I mean
conservatives. They are so angry that they are letting the mask drop and
taking aim at the voters. It reveals that it was never been about Trump
the man but about the people who support him. They hate the Dirt People
as much as any of the other Cloud People.

For the better part of two years, Liz Cheney has made the straight
forward argument that Trump is a menace and his voters are fascists.
Conservative Inc. just nodded along, because they agree with her. They
actually defended her as standing on principle, which is an amazing
claim when you stop and think about it. It means one of their principles
is that normal white people are monsters.

This result, along with the sagging poll numbers of the Republicans,
suggests that there is a change happening with the Dirt People. Voting
out an odious carbuncle like Cheney, just for the fun of it, is a rebuke
to the party. Some percentage of the Dirt People are waking up to the
scam that is the Republican Party and they are ready to act on it, even
if it means the crazies keep control.

Time will tell if the current polling is real, but the fact is the
Republicans are currently offering nothing to the voters. Mitch
McConnell is publicly hoping the Democrats keep the Senate. He shot down
a scheme to nationalize the election around issues like trade and
immigration, probably because he knows it would work. The party of Liz
Cheney is mad at its voters and maybe those voters are ready to get mad
back.
