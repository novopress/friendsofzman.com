A popular topic on this side of the great divide is how the conservative
movement managed to conserve nothing. Despite having billions of dollars
and popular support, they managed to lose every fight. In most cases,
they never bothered to fight at all, instead opting to preemptively
surrender. The prevailing view is a cynical one in that it is assumed
that their failures were profitable for the movement men. They got
lavish lifestyles in exchange for being reliably losers.

There is always some truth to these cynical claims, but it does not
explain why millions of well-intended white people signed onto the
movement. Even today, after all the failures, conservative rackets like
The Daily Wire, Prager U and Turning Point USA attract large audiences
and rake in hundreds of millions. According to its last publicly
available tax return, TPUSA raised $40 million in a year and paid its
president, Charlie Kirk, close to half a million dollars.

In fairness, the bulk of the money that flows into these companies is
institutional, corporate and oligarchical. National Review gets money
from the tech giants, who also give money to the grooming gangs
promoting crossdressing. The gatekeeping role of conservatism has been
their most lucrative grift. Even so, the conservative movement has
always enjoyed more support than it has earned. Given the record, it
should be dead now but it staggers on.

That means it is more than a well done grift. Conservatism offered
something to typical white people beyond practical politics. One clue is
in this <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/02/25/harry-jaffa-vs-willmoore-kendall-redivivus/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on the American Greatness site.
It is about Harry Jaffa, one of the leading intellectuals of 20th
century conservatism, who is credited with founding the Lincoln cult.
There is an effort to re-popularize Jaffa and his ideas, as a way to
breath life back into the corpse that is the conservative movement.

What Jaffa offered conservatives was a way to attach themselves to the
creedalism that came out of the war experience. By centering
conservatism on the Declaration and Lincoln, conservatives could not
only embrace the creedalism promoted by progressives during the war, but
claim to be a purer form of it. After all, if conservatism is rooted in
the Declaration, then the conservatives have as much of claim to
creedalism as the the so-called Left, maybe even a better claim.

Now, Jaffa’s argument was always nonsense. There is little evidence that
the Framers viewed the Declaration as their foundational text. The
Constitution should be proof enough, but the Federalist Papers end all
debate. The long public debate about the new constitution makes only a
few passing references to the Declaration. The debates during the
drafting make no mention of it. The Declaration was an expedient
political statement, not the foundation stone of an ideological
movement.

This was obvious when Jaffa was selling this stuff to desperate
conservatives looking for a way to steal the moral high ground from the
other side. Willmoore Kendall was one person not taken in by Jaffa. Mel
Bradford was another. They understood that Jaffa was simply adapting the
progressive moral framework created in the war years, so that opponents
of the New Dealers could participate in politics. The result was a
<a href="https://amgreatness.com/2023/03/03/the-lincoln-miracle/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">weird cult of Lincoln</a> that lacked an
alternative moral grounding.

Despite the irrationality of it, conservative creedalism was powerful
magic. Middle-class white people, unhappy with what they were seeing
from the political and cultural elites, had an antidote to
progressivism. They could still have the rules and order that normal
people expect, but also feel they were defending the ideals and mission
of the country, as stated at the founding.  The religion of America was
faith in the ideals of America and the best way to make the faith real
was conservatism.

This is why conservatism had no answer for multiculturalism. The best
reason to exclude people from alien societies is they are not like us.
When you firmly believe that anyone can be “us” as long as they get
misty when reading the opening lines of the Declaration, there is no
good argument against open borders. Openness becomes a prerequisite, as
the only way aliens can become “us” is if you let them in, which opened
the door to generations of social experimentation.

It is also why conservatives had no answer to the assault on private
association waged by progressives in the last century. Excluding woman
from a social club, for example, was tantamount to excluding women from
the American dream. Any organization that did not allow access to
everyone, based on objective criteria, was deemed to be un-American and
therefore against the law. Creedalism required the end of free
association and conservatives had no choice but to nod along.

It is also why suburban white people have been so slow to break from
conservatism, despite getting little in the way of practical
accomplishments. Conservative creedalism provided a vision of the future
and validation for the present. Suburban white people, seeing nonwhites
repeat lines from the creed was validation, but also presented a vision
of a future in which everyone lived like Americans. Our ways were not
just tradition or custom, but a template for all mankind.

This is a good lesson for those thinking about what comes next. Humans
are believing machines and they will commit themselves to a set of
beliefs if those beliefs offer a vision of the future free of some
unwanted bit of the present. The people we insist on calling the Left
are simply true believers, funneling their instinct into secular fads as
a way to feel validated, but to also focus on the glorious future. Their
natural instincts have been hijacked by ideological opportunists.

The alternative vision to crossdressers waving their genitals around the
schoolyard is not a spiffy new graph showing IQ differences. The
antidote to progressive lunacy is not appeals to the magic of the
marketplace like “go woke, go broke.” The way to defeat the prevailing
orthodoxy is by presenting an alternative moral order with a vision of
the future that promises salvation for the intended audience.
Conservative creedalism failed to do that, so it must be replaced.
