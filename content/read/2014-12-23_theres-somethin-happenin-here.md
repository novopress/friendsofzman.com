I think it’s time we stop.  
Children, what’s that sound?  
Everybody look what’s goin’ down.

There’s battle lines bein’ drawn.  
Nobody’s right if everybody’s wrong.  
Young people speakin’ their minds  
A-gettin’ so much resistance from behind.

The irony of it all. The people peeping outside their office windows,
cursing the people in the streets used to be the people in the streets.
Now they are pigs on two legs.
