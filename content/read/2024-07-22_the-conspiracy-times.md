**Note:** Behind the green door on the great stone of truth I have a
post about the dullness of political conventions, a post about the
normal people who still live in heritage America and the Sunday podcast.

**Note:** I jumped onto a Twitter space hosted by Pete Quinones Friday
night. I had just returned from a nice dinner and a long drive in the
country, so I was a bit tired, which means I was a bit incoherent, but
not too bad. Listen <a

The term “conspiracy theory” has been a popular and effective slur
against anyone skeptical of official narratives for a long time. The
main reason it has been effective is it was always used against people
with implausible theories. While the official narrative may not hold up,
the alternatives ranged from unlikely to absurd. We have now reached a
point where the poles have reversed. The “conspiracy theories” are often
far more plausible and sober minded than official narratives.

Yesterday, Biden announced he was not going to run. He released a letter
on Twitter, now stupidly called X and a supporting tweet. Others chimed
in to say that he had a long think about things while recovering from
Covid and decided that it was time to retire and pass the torch to his
most trusted understudy, Kamala Harris. Regime media then set off
memorializing the great man and his bold decision, thus setting the
stage for the Kamala Harris campaign.

The problem is none of this actually happened. The letter Biden
supposedly wrote was not written by him, but by
<a href="https://x.com/kylenabecker/status/1815198966687883635"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">some guy</a> named Steve. <a
href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/inside-bidens-withdrawal-i-need-you-and-mike-at-the-house-he-told-2-top-aides/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reportedly</a> he worked with Biden in
the middle of the night to craft the letter. Then he told the family
that Joe had decided to call it quits. Then a
<a href="https://x.com/kylenabecker/status/1815201356799418387"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">chubby girl</a> in the White House was
given the task of posting a scan of the letter on Twitter. The letter is
not on the official White House letterhead nor is it on the campaign
letterhead. Just plain paper.

Joe Biden has not made a public appearance in many days and is not
scheduled to show up anywhere at the moment. A sitting president
choosing not to run for re-election is highly unusual. For the president
who makes this decision, or any politician for that matter, it is the
biggest event of his career. The first sentence in Biden’s obituary will
now include his decision not to run for re-election. That requires more
than a tweet from a chubby intern and a letter written by your lawyer.

Adding to the official version is the fact that his campaign chair was
on television Sunday morning demanding the party fall in line behind
Biden. His top people were running around Washington whipping support
among donors and important party officials on the basis that Biden was
the nominee. Once news hit the internet, many of these people told the
press that they had no idea this was in the works and only heard the
news from their interns who are on social media.

In other words, nothing about the official narrative rings true. In
fact, it is so implausible that in a different time it would have been
one of the conspiracies floating around in response to a much more
plausible official narrative. This is the sort of thing Alex Jones says
on his show. The mystery guy named Steve Ricchetti, by the way, is a
long-time fixer and bag man for the Democratic Party. He is a boring
version of The Smoking Man from the old conspiracy series *The X Files*.

The trope from gangster movies is that when the mafia decides to whack a
guy, they find someone the victim trusts to do the deed. Steve Ricchetti
has been around Washington for almost as long as Biden and he has been
friends with Biden for decades. He has been in the White House with a
minor title, but he is one of the family’s closest advisers and he is
also keeps an eye on them for the regime. No doubt he was tasked with
delivering the bad news to the family.

It is unlikely that there was a scene at the family home where Steve
Ricchetti presented the already written letter to Biden and said, “I
either get your signature or your brains on this letter” but this
decision was obviously not a voluntary. The fact that Biden is unable to
speak publicly about it suggest he is in worse shape than we are being
told, which is probably why regime flunkies from the Republican Party
are now demanding he resign from office, or they invoke the 25th
amendment.

Given that Biden has not been in charge of things in any meaningful
sense since he was installed, having him serve out his time in a coma or
worse is not troubling to the people running things. It may be a problem
for them if Harris is installed, as it is known that the Biden staff
despises Harris and her people. In other words, the soft coup may be a
modified limited hangout to buy some time. The people running the White
House agreed to this, but not to Harris becoming president.

Alternatively, the people who engineered this soft coup did not think
too much about how it looks as they just wanted Biden out of the race.
They had Biden endorse Harris, but they can deal with that later. They
now have a month to figure out how to find someone who is plausible
enough as a candidate so that when the rigging machine kicks in on
election night, the results are plausible enough to accept. Maybe they
simply have not thought this far at all.

That is the other thing about our conspiratorial age. Not only are the
official narratives more ridiculous than the conspiracy theories, but
the people engineering the official narratives are thumbless screw-ups.
Even the guys lining their clothes with aluminum foil would have cooked
up a better story than the official narrative of how Biden decided to
quit the race. The official narratives are not just implausible, but
they are also stupid which makes the conspiracy itself stupid.

Of course, what all this points to is more ham-fisted shenanigans as the
regime plotters try to sell Harris as a plausible alternative to Trump
or find a suitable replacement if she flops this week. In other words,
we will get a firehose of nonsense and lies from the regime, which will
turn the conspiracy theory machine up to eleven. We have reached the
point where only a fool accepts the official truth, which opens the door
for everyone with a clever imagination to conjure alternatives.
