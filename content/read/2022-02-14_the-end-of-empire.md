Note: The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/reality-always-wins/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up. The subject of it
and today’s post is the rather bizarre crisis in Europe. Of course,
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/531246" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday Thoughts</a> is up behind the green door for
those needing audio stimulation. Much of it is about the situation in
Europe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The question that has not been given much consideration over the last
few decades is how exactly will the Global American Empire end? All
empires come to an end, but not all of them end the same. Usually, they
dissolve into their constituent parts like we saw with the Soviet Union.
This may or may not bring with it a spasm of violence, but the unnatural
combination eventually returns to its nature. What makes each empire
unique is its birth and its death.

Like every empire before it, the Global American Empire will end. This
may be what we are seeing with the current crisis in Europe over
Ukraine. Russia is well past the dissolution of the Soviet Empire.
Europe has also evolved past the old arrangements made necessary by the
Cold War. The only player stuck in the past is the Global American
Empire, which is carrying on like it is 1960. We are now seeing the
hints of the end for the American empire in Europe.

The starting place is the fact that the stuff coming from Washington is
so bizarre that not even the Ukrainians understand it. The
[rhetoric](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/surreal-plot-twist-ukraines-president-demands-proof-us-over-russian-invasion-claims)
has gone well beyond the normal sort of moralizing that has
distinguished the American empire. Washington and now
[London](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10508915/Boris-Johnson-plans-whistle-stop-tour-Europe-hold-talks-world-leaders.html)
have conjured a reality in which the Russians are ready to launch into
Ukraine while the Russians and Ukrainians are happy to find a peaceful
solution. The whole thing is making Washington look a bit nuts.

All of this happening against the reality that if the Russians want to
invade Ukraine there is nothing NATO can do about it. If the Russians
wanted to move onto Berlin there is not much NATO could do to stop them.
Over time, the West would be able to rally and cripple the Russians
economically, then roll them back militarily, but in the short term
everyone gets that NATO is a paper tiger. It is also a pointless vestige
from a bygone era that should have been scrapped a generation ago.

This is one entry point into the crisis. The Germans want to finish Nord
Stream 2 and build closer economic ties with Russia. The Russians want
to restore their ancient relationship with Western Europe. They will not
accept the American conditions that they must embrace the religion of
the West. There will be no rainbows and transsexuals in the Russian
culture. There will be no scenes of Russian soldiers walking around in
pumps claiming to be sorry for their ancestors.

The Germans and the French seem to be ready to make the deal with the
Russians and begin a new era for both sides. The Russians can maintain
their traditional model for organizing themselves and Europe will begin
to normalize economic relations with the rest of Eurasia. This leaves
little room for the Global American Empire, which is based on an
assertion that there is only one moral way to organize a society. This
potential new arrangement is a rebuke of the very idea of empire.

Another entry point into viewing the current crisis as a stage in the
dissolution of the Global American Empire is in the reaction itself.
Even the American media has lost track of how many times the Biden
people have claimed an invasion is imminent. It feels like it is a
weekly thing now. The State Department swears the tanks are revving
their engines and then nothing happens. European leaders have to be
wondering if the empire is losing its grip on reality.

The hysteria could very well be the only thing left. Again, if Russian
draws the line on NATO expansion and takes over Ukraine, there is very
little Washington can do about it other than make a lot of noise. The
promise of crippling economic sanctions is as ridiculous as the rest of
the bellowing. Europe needs to buy important stuff from Russia in order
to exist. Germany and France will go along with superficial stuff to
please Washington, but they are not committing suicide over Ukraine.

What we may be entering is a final phase of the Global American Empire
in which [conflicting
realities](https://www.takimag.com/article/reality-always-wins/) create
a lot of friction. One reality is that America’s dominion over Europe
was always unnatural for both sides. In the Cold War it was seen as a
necessity, so it was a tolerable contradiction. Those conditions have
not existed for over a generation now and reality is reasserting itself.
Western Europe will be dominated by France and Germany and Eastern
Europe by Russia.

Another set of conflicting realities is that the heritage stock of
America never wanted to be a major player in world affairs. The sales
pitch by the imperial leaders was always based on this assumed
reluctance. The Global American Empire was a necessity born out of war
and tragedy. That necessity is long over and yet the managerial elite of
the empire insists on maintaining the empire. Meanwhile the public is
dealing with cultural and economic collapse.

There has never been a time when the average American has felt more
divorced from his government than now. The guy the empire counts on to
wave the flag and respond to war drums is not sure which side to
support. This is one of those unspoken truths about this Ukraine affair.
The reservoir of patriotism is now dry among the cohort of Americans who
have always been the most patriotic. The response from these people over
Ukraine is a shrug or maybe a wry smile.

This may be what the end empire is like from the inside. We will have
spasms of bellowing and shouting from Washington, but the world will
slowly crawl out from under the shadow of Washington. Meanwhile,
domestic politics will grow increasingly untenable, with populist revolt
replacing electoral organizing. The system simply stops working as the
reason for it to keep working no longer makes sense. The end of empire
is a million small breakdowns in the system.
