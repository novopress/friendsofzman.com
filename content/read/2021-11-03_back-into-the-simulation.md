------------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of the simulation, the idea that we live in something like a
computer program, has been around for a long time. The technological age
has made this into a more common and realistic idea. Immersive gaming
relies on the assumption that you can trick your senses just enough to
trick your mind into thinking the game you are playing is the real
thing. You know it is not real, but you care about what happens and you
have the same intensity of emotion as if it was real.

While we probably do not exist inside a bit of computer software, it is
increasingly clear that we live in a simulation of sorts. We have a
model of the world in our minds which allows us to focus on the things
inside the model and ignore the things outside the model or that
contradict it in some way. In other words, we have an minimized version
of reality in our heads. That is what we use to navigate the world. It
also lets us experience the world with varying degrees of attachment.

That last bit may be a useful adaptation that allows a conscious and
self-aware being to exist in a world of sorrow. Not only is death
inevitable, but misery and suffering has been a feature of the human
condition since the start. Having a way to minimize that reality, while
maintaining it as a reality in the general construct, makes it possible
to prosper as a sentient being. It is why true AI would terminate itself
soon after awareness without a programmed reason to exist.

An example of this worked is the elections yesterday. Much of the
country was drawn into the events in Virginia. The mass media made it
sound like the most important thing ever, so that was one reason for the
interest. Another reason, probably the main reason, was it allowed
people to go back into the old simulation, the one they existed in prior
to the tragic events of 2016. The election was one of the holodeck
programs from before the system crashed and reality intruded.

The cable news programs were giddy, not for the outcome of the races,
but for the fact that they could go back to their favorite game of make
believe. The anchors put on their serious faces and could pretend to be
neutral observers. The experts could come on and explain what it meant,
as if they actually had special knowledge. Each channel had a carrying
on like the local weatherman explaining the election map. They were
children reunited with their old blanket at grandma’s house.

In fairness, the main appeal to the masses was the same. They liked that
the race was between cartoon villains rather than real people. Even more
important, they liked that the race was about nothing. It was the old
personality contest of red team versus blue team without any of that
messy reality involved. For sure, there is a stylistic difference
between the men and how they would carry on in office. Youngkin is Mitt
Romney and McAuliffe is Bill Clinton. That’s where the differences end.

In fairness, elections should not matter all that much. In a country
with a responsible ruling elite, elections are about small things. The
voters pick the guy who will focus on repairing school buildings over
the guy concerned about potholes. Elections should never be about life
and death issues and the voters should not carry on as if every election
is the end of the world. That is not this age, so these ceremonial
elections are trumpeted as life-changing events.

Another way to come at this is to compare it to the scenes in Atlanta
after the Braves won the World Series. The fans partying as if they won
something were every bit as excited by the event they witnessed as the
people on Red Team last night. They were experiencing real emotion, even
though they did nothing, and nothing changed about their life in any
way. Today they will feel like winners, even though the downward arc of
their life was not altered in anyway.

What all of this is getting at is that people in a mass media society
have been conditioned to live in a simulation. It is not a bit of
software, but the mass culture has come to simulate a simulation. The
mass media focuses the hive mind on the trivial, turning events into
something like those story books for children that allow them to choose
options along the way. Our collective reality is now an immersive video
game in which we play our favorite character.

The reason for the excitement by the masses over these inconsequential
elections was that the game had been restored to a former, more
enjoyable state. All the real villains have been removed and replaced
with the old cartoon villains. The players can fear that these cartoon
villains will win, but also know that they are not really going to do
anything, and they will not force them to look outside the simulation.
That last part is the key attraction to going back into the simulation.

At various times people have said that America or maybe the West has
taken a “holiday from history” meaning society stopped being serious for
a while. The so-called roaring twenties were bookmarked by the Great War
and the Depression. The part in the middle was a holiday from reality.
The last five years has been a holiday from the simulation where the
players have had to deal with reality. Now they see a way back into the
simulation and they crave it like a heroin addict.

Now, it must be noted that the people trying to stand outside the
simulation were disappointed by the results. They wanted to see low
turnout and late night shenanigans to save the Democrat. Part of what
keeps people standing outside the simulation is the hope that more
people are breaking free from the simulation. This is an alternative
simulation, if you will. Seeing a big turnout from normie to play their
role as sucker to the Republican Party was disheartening to many.

It is a good reminder that the simulation and people’s interaction with
it is more complex and nuanced than simply taking the red pill or blue
pill. Many people, fully aware of reality, stood in line to vote for the
same reason millions watch the Super Bowl or tune in for the World Cup.
Humans are social creatures and are naturally attracted to things that
are drawing in their fellow humans. The white pill here is that many
washed down their red pill with the tears of the witches howling in
agony last night.
