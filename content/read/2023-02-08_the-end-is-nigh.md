A popular narrative among libertarians, gold bugs, doomsday types and
other pessimists involves the end of the dollar. Because of the
structural flaws in fiat money, the abuse of the dollar’s reserve
status, excessive money printing, the prettiness of gold or other
factors, the world will one day decide that it no longer wants to use
dollars and the dollar will collapse.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxQs7gOMSo&amp;t=1534s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Peter Schiff</a> has built a media career
using a combination of these causes to predict the end of the dollar.

There is an old joke about the market pessimists having predicted ten of
the last three market crashes that applies here. The people predicting
the end of the dollar, or the petrodollar as many prefer, have been
making this prediction since Nixon closed the gold window fifty years
ago. All of the predications have turned out to be wrong, but that has
had no impact on the dollar pessimists. It turns out that there is good
money to be made in being wrong about the dollar.

There are a number of reasons why the dollar remains the global
currency, despite the abuse of it by the Global American Empire. This <a
href="https://www.revolver.news/2023/02/sorry-zerohedge-for-better-or-worse-us-dollar-remains-king-of-currencies/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on Revolver by an anonymous
former U.S. Treasury official covers some of the major ones. The simple
elevator speech on why the dollar remains the reserve currency is that
the major powers of the global economy prefer it for now. China, Russia,
India and the OPEC cartel continue to use the dollar as they work on the
coming alternative.

That last bit is an important part of understanding what will come in
the next decade with regards to global currency. The unipolar world
controlled by Washington is slowly slipping away, being replaced by a
multipolar world. For ideological and practical reasons, Washington is
fighting this with all of its might. It is a losing fight as a unipolar
world was an accident of 20th century history. It turns out that [Samuel
Huntington](https://archive.is/V8oH2) was right and [Francis
Fukuyama](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-End-of-History-and-the-Last-Man/Francis-Fukuyama/9780743284554)
was wrong.

The great challenge of this age, it turns out, is that the emerging
civilization centers of the world are emerging into the unipolar world.
On the one hand, they need to remake the world order to reflect this new
reality. On the other hand, they still depend in significant ways on the
old structures from the unipolar order. They cannot overthrow the old
order without incurring significant costs. Of course, there is the
Global America Empire, which stands athwart history yelling “stop!”

In this regard, the dollar is a symbol of the current crisis, because it
is the symbol, the primary tool, of the old unipolar order. Just as
removing the dollar as the reserve currency would bring about
significant economic costs, removing America as the center of the global
order brings serious risks. Not the least of those risks is an
increasingly unstable political class armed with nuclear weapons. Joe
Biden prattling on about nuclear war does not inspire confidence.

The result is the emerging new power centers are becoming extremely
cautious as they proceed down the path toward a multipolar world. China
could take Taiwan by force if it chose, but that brings risks it is
unwilling to assume. It is not just the cost of war, which would be
significant, but also the cost of victory. The sight of an American
carrier, on fire, sinking into the Pacific could collapse the American
empire. That would take the dollar with it and everything that counts on
it.

Similarly, the Russians could have hit back at the West over the
economic sanctions, but instead it has simply chosen to avoid them. The
reality is, every European country is looking for ways around the
sanctions. These workarounds are costly and they are hollowing out their
economies, but they are the better than alternative. For Russia, the
sanction regime is mostly a nuisance, but it buys time as they and the
other emerging global power centers build their infrastructure.

In a way, we are seeing a real world example of what Joseph Tainter
described in his
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X),
*The Collapse of Complex Societies*. Collapse is only possible if there
is no supporting structures surrounding the society. The Western Roman
Empire collapsed because there was nothing around it. It was a complex
society in isolation, as what surrounded it was a collection of tribal
societies. America, in contrast, is deeply connected to the other
complex societies.

Instead of collapse, what we are seeing is a controlled demolition. The
Russians, for example, would welcome the return of rational governance
in Europe, they would prefer to avoid radical change. An economic crisis
could easily trigger a political crisis and unleash sudden political
change. The last two times this happened have not been good for Russia.
The first time brought Napoleon to Moscow. Of course, the last time it
brought Hitler to Stalingrad.

China, India, the OPEC countries and even Brazil have similar concerns
with what lies between the present order and the multipolar order that
is coming. The Global American Empire, including its control of the
global reserve currency, is an obstacle that lies between now and then,
but it is a problem that must be carefully managed. The efforts by
Washington provoke a crises in Asia and Europe are viewed as an effort
to derail the transition from a unipolar world to a multipolar world.

This brings us back to the dollar. If the world avoids catastrophe, then
it will avoid the sudden uncontrolled collapse of the dollar. Instead it
will be a slow transition to a world of multiple trusted currencies that
rely on separate financial systems. Those currencies will be linked to
the only true global commodity, which is energy. The relative strength
of each currency will reflect the trust and accuracy of the
corresponding financial systems that make transacting in the currency
possible.

What this means is the petrodollar will slowly become the petro. All the
large global currencies, including the dollar, will be pegged to the
supply of energy, plus or minus the relative trust of the political
systems of the issuing society. Again, this assumes the world avoids
catastrophe. If a controlled demolition of the Global American Empire
proves impossible, then all of those off-grid living videos you watched
will suddenly and explosively come in handy.
