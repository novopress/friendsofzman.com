When Americans think of government corruption, it is government
officials getting the public’s money confused with their own money.
Maybe a politician takes bribes to do the bidding of someone with
interests before the government. It can also be a civil servant taking
bribes to do someone a favor. Alternatively, it can be the government
insiders colluding with outside players so that the insiders make money
from a government contract or a government program.

While those are examples of corruption, the problem goes beyond people
in government stealing from the public. In the general sense, corruption
is an indifference to the rules that supposedly govern society. The
corrupt do not see the rules as limits on their behavior, but as
obstacles to overcome in pursuit of their goals. They have no respect
for or allegiance to the spirit of the law. More important, they have no
respect for the morality that lies behind the law.

This contempt for the spirit of the law is on display in the ongoing
trial of Clinton lawyer Michael Sussman. He is charged with lying to the
FBI about his relationship with the Clinton campaign. He brought the
phony Russian collusion hoax material to the FBI claiming he got it as
part of his work on cyber security. According to the FBI, he said he was
not representing anyone with regards to the issue. In truth he was
working for the Clinton campaign on exactly this issue.

Charging someone with lying to the government is usually a way to
leverage a lawyer or public official into cooperation. The charge itself
is relatively minor, but it has serious career consequences, so it is a
good tool to use on a lawyer. In this case, it appears the prosecutor is
using it as a way to build a larger narrative to explain how the biggest
hoax in American history was perpetrated on the public. This trial
provides the general plot structure for the rest of the story that will
come later.

That plot structure is this. Sussman was running a group of dirty tricks
people for the Clinton campaign back in 2016. Using a lawyer for this
provides them with some confidentiality in the event things go wrong.
Sussman hired a group called Fusion GPS and some other freelance
operators to manufacture dirt on Trump. They would then feed this to
reporters on their payroll. [Franklin
Foer](https://www.foxnews.com/media/slate-journalist-story-fusion-gps-trump-russian-bank)
is someone they used to put these fake stories into the mainstream
media.

The way this fraud worked is Sussman went to the FBI with fake documents
alleging a secret channel between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. As
a partner in a connected Washington law firm, he gets priority access to
senior officials in the FBI and the Department of Justice. Meanwhile,
others are planting the story with their people in the media with the
claim the FBI is already looking into it. The media hacks then call the
FBI for comment and add that to the story.

There is nothing new here. Political actors have been using friends in
the media since the dawn of the printing press. The reason we have the
Sally Hemmings fable is that opponents of Jefferson slandered him in the
media of the time with the claim that he was having sex with his slaves.
In this age, when all of the mass media is in the pocket of the
uniparty, the fake news is mostly about promoting the aims of the party
and distracting people from that which is bad for the party.

An interesting wrinkle in this case is that Sussman got the fake
documentation for the Trump-Russia link from one of the goons on his
dirty tricks squad. That trickster was a person named Rodney Joffe, who
was some sort of IT consultant. He was the guy who allegedly created the
fake documentation. He was also an FBI informant, according to the
various filings in the case. This raises an obvious question about who
actually concocted the Russian collusion hoax.

That may be the point of this trial and the long running Durham
investigation, which promises to continue for many years. By pinning the
scandal on Sussman, they can also pin the scandal on Hillary Clinton.
That serves the interests of the uniparty by making sure she does not
run again on 2024. More important, it paints the FBI as the innocent
party, hoodwinked by those dastardly Clinton people. Sussman has been
paid to take the fall, which is why he is not cooperating.

That may seem a bit Machiavellian, until you remember that the senior
staff of the FBI were engaged in wholesale spying on the Trump campaign.
There is no question that two dozen or so characters involved in the
Spygate scandal defrauded the courts and violated their oath of office.
One guy was charged in that for doctoring an e-mail that was used to
defraud the court. Otherwise, the rest have sailed off into lives of
comfort, having done their part for the cause.

Then you have the Mueller investigation. This was engineered by people
in the Department of Justice and the FBI who knew at the time that the
claims about Russian collusion were manufactured by the Clinton
campaign. That is something else that has come out in the Sussman trial.
The FBI knew the documents provided were fake and they knew the source
of them. Since the source was a confidential FBI informant, it is
possible that the real source was the FBI all along.

All of this sounds like the grubby political intrigue that has
distinguished the Clinton era of politics, but it also highlights the
depravity of the political system. Across the upper reaches of the
political system is a deep contempt for the rules. The claims made about
Nixon fifty years ago have now become the culture of Washington. The
charge against Nixon was that he corrupted the institutions for personal
gain. Today the institutions corrupt anyone unfortunate enough to have
contact with them.

Corruption has consequences. Once a ruling class stops respecting its
own rules, the rest of society soon follows. For example, it was the
Russophobia created by the Clinton dirty tricks campaign that opened the
door for the neocons. Five years of demonizing Putin and Russia to
attack Trump made it easy for the usual reptiles to launch this
pointless war against Russia. Every time you buy gas or food, you can
thank Hillary Clinton for the sticker shock.

Another example to consider is the media. One of the things revealed in
the trial thus far is the degree of collusion between members of the
elite press and the people running the dirty tricks campaign. Fusion GPS
was founded by journalists. None of the “reporters” who participated in
this hoax have been punished. Many of them have been given awards for
their “reporting” on the story. The media is every bit as mobbed up as
the people on the political class.

One final note on the Sussman trial. The judge in the case is connected
to the FBI gangsters exposed during Spygate. He also used to pal around
with Sussman when they were learning how to be crooks together. The jury
has several Clinton donors, to make sure the jury remains impartial. For
those old enough to remember, the trial now has [this
leve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaz2hxZLycY)l of objectivity and
probity. Anyone thinking Sussman gets convicted should calibrate their
expectations accordingly.

The lack of public interest in this case is due, in part, to the media
organs of the party being told to ignore it. The bigger reason is that
the staggering level of corruption in the ruling class has been
normalized. People are no longer shocked or offended by the lying from
Washington. It is the rare times when someone speaks honestly that grabs
the attention of the public. The Sussman trial confirms the obvious.
America is a kleptocracy run by a thoroughly corrupt ruling elite.
