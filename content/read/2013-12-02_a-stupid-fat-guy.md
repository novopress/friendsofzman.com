It’s probably immoral to make sport of big fat guys like New Jersey
governor Chris Christie, but everyone does it. Fair or foul, it is
assumed that obesity is a character flaw, an indication the person lacks
self-control. For a politicians, it is an easy line of attack, but it
does not seem to be a huge problem for them, no pun intended. There have
been plenty fatties in politics. Christie is going to run for president
and he probably will have a lot of support, despite being a morbidly
obese man with an obnoxious demeanor.

He has the support of the party establishment. He is a moderate. He got
a lot of votes from blacks and Hispanics. He is a fund raising machine
and he has the support of the GOP governors. That’s a winning hand in a
wide open field. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have their followers, but they
lack the sex appeal and resources to build on it. Plus, the donor party
hates these guys as they don’t always follow orders. Christie can be
relied upon to do what he is told, without trying to think on his own
too much.

Of course, he has the habit of rushing over to grovel before the Left,
which makes him the ideal Republican these days. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here he is</a> coming to the
defense of Mario Cuomo’s kid, which is the go to move for the GOP wimp.
That means as president, he’ll make a lot of noise, but in the end will
surrender to the Left in every issue. That makes him the ideal candidate
for a party that exists only to defend the Democrat party. Having a a
guy who reminds everyone of Ned Beatty as the GOP standard bearer makes
perfect sense.
