A truth revealed by the widescale adoption of the internet was that
there were millions of people with a blue pencil desperate to use it.
The Grammar Nazi is a thing unearthed and unleashed on the world by the
internet. When comment sections were still common, every story or post
came with comments correcting the grammar or highlighting a typo. It was
clear that the person posting the comment had no interest in the content
of the post, other than what he considered to be violations of the rules
of grammar.

The Grammar Nazi is something that can only exist online. Sure, he could
get a teaching job and terrorize school children or get a job as a copy
editor at a newspaper, but where is the fun in that? The thing that
brings joy to the black heart of the Grammar Nazi is correcting people
who do not expect to be corrected. Finding a post online that has an
open comment section and then posting a short note about a missing comma
or the incorrect use of “there/their” is the fruit of life.

Unfortunately for the Grammar Nazi, his days are running short because
the same forces that brought him to life are about to take away his
life. Another thing we will get with AI is the rigid formalization of
online discourse. The old fashioned spellcheck and grammar check in Word
will soon be replaced by real-time rewrites of your text in the
generally accepted form. That means no more grammar errors or spelling
errors for the Grammar Nazi to hunt online.

There will be people who holdout and write their own text. There are
people who still own pens and pads of paper. It will not be long,
however, when the browser simply corrects your “mistakes” and rewrites
your copy. Those idiomatic expressions you love so much will be replaced
with text that can easily be translated into other languages and
understood by new language learners. The same will happen with colorful
euphemisms and salty language. None of it will be allowed.

You can see the future in Word. Run text through the old-fashioned
spelling and grammar check and it regularly suggests you change the
wording of sentences in order to make them less interesting. For
example, if you type “There are a lot of mudgets in here”, misspelling
“midgets” as you see, it will not suggest the word “midget” as the
replacement because that is an offensive term. If you persist, it will
warn that it is insensitive language. We know what comes next.

On the other hand, the genuinely stupid will soon be able to present
themselves online as they imagine themselves through services like
Grammarly that will rewrite their incoherent jibber-jabber into
something intelligible. In fact, they will not even need to know how to
read and write. They will just speak and the machine will figure out
what they should write and write it. This
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEk4TjOStkk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">woman</a> will never have to worry that she may be a
“magician” rather than a “musician.”

That may be a bridge too far, but you can see how these grammar services
can quickly transition from mere grammar services into thinking
services. The low-IQ person may not fully understand the resulting
product, but the happy face emoji at the end of the process will let her
know she did good. In effect, technology will remove the midwit from the
internet and replace her with a bot, a bot that never makes a spelling
or grammar error to give the game away.

It is easy to dismiss these sorts of claims about technology and the
language, but they are based on our history with the printed word. The
very idea of grammar as something to debate was made possible by the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syp1DVQgN_g" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">printing press</a>. The necessary standardization that
came with the mass production of text changed how we think. It changed
the grammar, punctuation, spelling and even the alphabet. We write a
different language as a result, which means we think in a different
language too.

Unlike the time when the printing press revolutionized the world, ours
is a much darker time with tighter rules on what can and cannot be said.
We already see how the internet has narrowed and dulled the public
debate. When it can intercede between your brain and what you are trying
to write, it is easy to see how we can quickly get to a future that
Orwell would have thought impossible. Soon, it may be impossible to post
an impure thought or a poorly formed sentence.

Even if it does not reach that point, these writing services will surely
strip originality and creativity from the language. The constant
hectoring from Word about the use of “write a book” instead of “author a
book” will eventually wear down users to the point where this sort of
variety is gone from our writing. All nuance and idiosyncrasy will be
replaced with the technical manual version that the robots demand. As a
result, we will become as boring and stupid as a National Review
columnist.

There are signs of this happening. This <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/germany-influence-of-english-idiots-apostrophe"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about changes in German grammar
is a good example of what lies ahead. This change is not to make German
more precise to Germans, but to make it more accessible to non-German
speakers. That may sound good to English speakers, but language is more
than just how people speak. It is how they think and how they think
evolved over generations. How they think is their inheritance from their
ancestors and the core of their culture.

Of course, the main argument against the Grammar Nazi was that grammar
is a fluid thing that changes over time. Obsessive concern for rules of
grammar and word usage is a losing fight. After all, what we think of as
punctuation is a novelty in the history of the written word. The core
features of the current rules were innovations. To put an end to
innovation is an effort to kill the spirit of the language. Like the
people who speak it, the language must be free to seek its own path.

That is now where things are heading, at least not for the written word.
It will not be long before the outlaw is the man who uses outlawed words
in outlawed forums using now outlawed word processing software and
browsers. Everyone else will screaming into the void that is the Large
Language Model version of the software, as it rewrites their text to
remove unpermitted thoughts and expressions. The Grammar Nazi will have
been replaced by this new, hellish form of spellcheck.
