rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is a sensible take on the Syria
mess</a>. One thing that is always true about the so-called conventional
wisdom in Washington is that it is always wrong. The reason is the
people chattering away on TV or on-line don’t know anything and they
don’t really need to know anything. There job is to be a circus of
distractions. The most these people amount to are flunkies and coat
holders for the political class. That’s how they end up on TV, where
they can make good money says whatever nonsense they are told to say.

The writer of that linked post is also right about the point of the
Obama foreign policy strategy. Obama does not care about this stuff. His
people may care, because they are doing the bidding of other interests,
but Team Obama is all about domestic politics, not foreign adventures.
Using this situation to score some political points against the
warmongers in the GOP is good domestic politics. It also gets him off
the hook with Israel who would love to see the US invade another one of
their adversaries.

Obama is not the hardest working guy and he is no political genius, but
Progressives never lose sight of their purpose. They always look to
cause trouble for their enemies, real and imagined, so they always have
a strategy. They know his party will vote in lockstep with the
administration. A handful of peaceniks will be allowed to vote against
it for effect, but 90% will fall in line.  Given the comically bad
leadership of the House GOP, the predictable result is Boner crying on
TV as his party dissolves into a food fight over Syria.

In the Senate, the leadership on the GOP side is better, but you have
warmongers like that senile old fool John McCain ruling the roost. There
the administration will have an easier time of it. He can count on forty
GOP votes, allowing the very liberal senators to vote against it. Given
the number of vulnerable seats this year, this is a great result for the
Democrats. They get their enemy warring with itself and team Obama gets
to avoid the trap of war in Syria. When you have a purpose, you always
have a plan.
