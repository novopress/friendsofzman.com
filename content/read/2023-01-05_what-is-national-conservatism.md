National conservatism, a movement created by Israeli Zionist Yoram
Hazony, has gained some degree of respectability over the last decade.
People associated with the movement have been given space on mainstream
platforms. His
<a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-3-2022/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">conferences</a> get a large crowd of academic types,
most of whom get a speaking role. The event is one part academic
conference, one part networking event. Of course, it is all made
possible by billionaire Peter Theil who underwrites it.

Therein lies the first puzzle. Look at the collection of people
associated with the movement and it is hard to find common ground. Peter
Theil calls himself a libertarian, but he supported Trump. Granted, the
space between Trump’s 1980’s civic nationalism and libertarianism is not
that great, but most libertarians threw their dresses over their heads
and went squealing into the night when Trump arrived. They joined their
friends on the Left in calling him a fascist.

It gets fuzzier when you see paleos like Paul Gottfried and Daniel
McCarthy, along with varieties of the “new right” like Michael Anton and
Josh Hammer. The only thing these people have in common is support for
Trump. Otherwise, they do not have much in common with one another, at
least on the surface. Then you have people like Rod Dreher and David
Goldman speaking at these events. Hazony’s events are the bar in Star
Wars for dispossessed right-wing intellectuals.

Things get more muddled when you look at where some of these people come
down on the key issues of the day.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9qTvZjxBdM" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> is John O’Sullivan giving a speech about
Ukraine at the most recent conference. He clearly knows nothing about
the Ukraine or the war, but he is happy to defend the Global American
Empire’s meddling. <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/29/a-national-conservative-case-for-arming-ukraine/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is someone writing the “national
conservative case” for arming Ukraine. He thinks war with Russia will
help in the war with China to come.

Those two are not outliers. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Virtue-Nationalism-Yoram-Hazony-ebook/dp/B078W5XGZG/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is Yoram Hazony making the
rather farfetched claim that Ukraine was just minding its own business
when for no reason at all Russia decided to invade them. If one were to
take Hazony’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Virtue-Nationalism-Yoram-Hazony-ebook/dp/B078W5XGZG/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>, *The Virtue of Nationalism*, at
face value, you would expect him to take the opposite position. After
all, Hazony’s book is an argument against empire and it is the Global
American Empire that is the cause of the war in Ukraine.

Of course, no one can read Hazony’s book and not see that it is mostly a
way to give Europeans the language to defend Zionism. The prevailing
ideology of Western elites is explicitly anti-nationalist. An ethnostate
like Israel falls far outside of what Western elites consider
acceptable, so you can see the problem. Israel <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-718898"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">ethnically cleansing</a> the West Bank
does not fit the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion pogrom. The Hazony
project is mostly a way to square that circle to Western conservatives.

As an aside, Hazony makes the claim in his book that a people have a
right to a homeland if they have the ability to keep and maintain it. He
makes this qualification for two obvious reasons. First, it sets a size
limit for a nation. Otherwise, three people could get together and
demand independence. The other reason is it allows for the easy
dismissal of Arab claims in Israel. The Palestinians have no claims
because they cannot keep their own lands.

The fact that this argument is best applied to Israel is never
addressed. After all, Israel would not exist without the British then
the Americans. The entirety of Israeli foreign policy for over half a
century has been to use any means necessary to gain favor with great
powers in order to fend off the Arabs. Israel is the product of empire.
Now that the Global American Empire is looking weak, Israel is now
cutting the Ukrainians loose in <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/04/israel-foreign-minister-cohen-russia-ukraine-lavrov"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">favor</a> of the Russians.

Putting that aside, the question remains, what is national conservatism?
At this point, the best answer is that it is a holding area for people
not welcome at reputable events who never want to be associated with
disreputable events. For example, Jason Richwine is welcome at a Hazony
event, but at that same event Hazony will rage against “race science”
like a grievance studies major. Mark Krikorian is welcome, but anyone
associated with VDare is banned.

The result is that national conservatism is sort of island of misfit
toys. The only thing holding them together is a desire to get a seat at
the table. Thiel’s money lets them put on extravagant conferences at
world class facilities, which draw in famous people looking for some
street cred as an outsider. For example, Marco Rubio, a product of
Conservative Inc., gave a speech at Hazony’s event and now <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/my-plan-for-american-renewal/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">talks</a> about himself as an implacable
foe of the Washington political establishment.

Otherwise, national conservatism is a term without meaning. The
nationalism expressed by people like Hazony is situational. Israel can
build settlements in Arab areas because it is in their national
interest. Russia, meanwhile, is guilty of imperialism when she moves to
defend ethnic Russians from Ukrainian fanatics underwritten by the
Global American Empire. This sounds like the same old neoconservatism
that has plagued us since the middle of the last century.

As for the conservatism, there is not much agreement. Hazony claims that
American conservatism is rooted in Burke. The umbrella
<a href="https://burke.foundation/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">group</a> that sponsors his activity is called the
Edmund Burke Foundation. On the other hand, the Claremont people that
freely circulate in these events reject that claim. They are Lockeans,
at least with regards to the American founding. Others are social
conservatives rooting their moral claims in the authority of their
religion.

There is nothing wrong with heterodoxy. In fact, more events where
disparate people can socialize and debate is a good thing. As a
movement, however, there has to be something more than Peter Theil’s
money and estrangement from the cool kid’s table of the prevailing
orthodoxy. Without a common goal or even a common narrative, it is just
a collection of outsiders desperate to get back in, terrified of the
ominous sounds coming from the darkness to their right.
