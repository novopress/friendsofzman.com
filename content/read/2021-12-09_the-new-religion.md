**Note:** Somewhat related to the post today is a
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/483119" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> behind the green door about the classic movie
Ben-Hur. It is an amazing film to watch in the current context,
especially when you think about the audience of the time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you were a peasant in the early medieval times and one day you
looked up from your toils to see some men on the road wearing funny
outfits. You see that they must be of means as they are not covered in
muck and they have men of arms guarding them, but they are strange and
different. They are headed in the direction of the lord’s home. You
assume they are nobles of some sort. You are a peasant, so you go back
to toiling away and think no more of it.

Days later, the lord’s men come to round up you and your neighbors.
Everyone is herded down to the river. The lord is there and to your
surprise the men you saw the other day are there as well. The lord
announces that everyone is now something called a Christian and
worshipping the old gods will no longer be allowed. Along with the other
peasants, you are walked out into the river where you get dunked while
the strangers say something in an alien language.

This is not exactly how Europe was Christianized, but it is not far off.
Men from the Church would cut deals with the local rulers. The nobles
would get financial help from the Church, maybe even promises of
military support. In exchange the nobleman would become a Christian and
his people would also become Christians. Early on, the Church took the
“whatever means necessary” to win over converts. Many conversions were
sincere of course, but many were out of convenience.

We don’t know if the old religions swept Europe the same way. It is
possible they followed agriculture as it swept Europe. Regardless, the
same paradox of conversion must have existed. There is a point at which
they went from some older form of belief to the more personal and
concrete belief of polytheism. Like the paradox of the heap, there is
some point at which a society stops being defined by one set of beliefs
and is defined by a new set of beliefs. We are in such a phase now.

If you are old enough to remember the Cold War, then you are like the
medieval peasant at the beginning. All of a sudden, the people in charge
now believe weird new things for no obvious reason. You try to assign
the usual reasons for what you see, things like power and money, but
they make less sense over time. After all, the people in charge have all
of the power and money. What is in it for billionaires like George Soros
who underwrite this strange new faith?

One reason for what is happening is something called *isomorphism. *This
[post](https://www.city-journal.org/why-woke-organizations-all-sound-the-same)
in City Journal explains why social pressure is causing the people at
the top to conform to this bizarre new faith informally called Wokism.
Humans are social animals with a strong instinct to conform. In a world
full of uncertainty, both personally and collectively, Wokism offers
structure and a form of shelter. The underlying logic of this new
religion is not as important as the structure it promises.

The problem with that post is it does not address the origins of this
strange new religion and why it got started in the first place. It also
fails to grasp that Wokism is a religion, rather than a social fad. It
is assumed that religions require a well-defined anthropomorphic deity
or deities, but this is a cultural bias. The evidence suggests that
these well-defined gods were a product of settlement. When man was in
the hunter-gatherer stage, nature was his god.

When viewed as a religion, things make a bit more sense. Religion first
and foremost explains the natural world. For ruling-class people their
environment is now the culture that has evolved in urban areas. They
have little interaction with nature, other than to see it from their
window. The natural environment of most people, especially those
embracing this new religion of Wokism, is the highly urbanized and
socially constructed world of the Cloud People, like universities.

It is not surprising that this new religion would be born on campus.
They have been the monasteries of America since the beginning. The
Puritans founded Harvard soon after they arrived for the purpose of
training preachers. The beliefs of the ruling class of America have
always been incubated and maintained on the college campus, so it is no
surprise that this new faith was hatched there. The newly minted
faithful then went forth to convert the masses.

It is also no surprise that the corporation have taken the lead in
conversion. One of the few things the old radicals in the last century
got right was the relationship between corporate America and the
culture. Corporatism has always been the organizing principle of the
American empire. Corporations sell the culture through advertising,
entertainment and consumer goods. Now they are selling the religion and
forcing the conversion of the people.

This is why the old liberals are baffled by it all. The New Left is in
bed with corporate America in a way that would have shamed the Right not
long ago. The old school lefties, trapped in the old ideology, are
unable to grasp what is happening, because they are operating from the
old framing. Similarly, conservatives are unwitting dupes in the process
of conversion because they were conditioned to defend corporations from
the “socialists and communists” on the Left.

Getting back to the primary role of religion, this new faith is catching
on with the rulers because it explains what they are seeing in their
natural world. First, they see the browning of the West. Even though
they could put an end to it tomorrow and even reverse the trend, that
requires things of them they no longer possess, so the new religion
makes it seem like a naturally occurring thing. The arc of history is
toward a multicultural universe free of white supremacy.

Wokism also explains why people are not the same, despite the unshakable
belief that all men are created equal. The disparate outcomes must be
the result of the social structures of society. The new religion not
only explains the conflict between reality and their beliefs, but it
also gives them a purpose. Overturning the white power structure to
liberate the people from white supremacy is the ritual and practice of
the faith. Wokism tells them the universe cares about them and has a
plan for them.

This is why it is delusional to think this stuff is just a fad and will
fade without having to confront it in the culture war. That is the old
libertarian impulse to cower on the sidelines while pretending to be
above it all. The new religion may be at odds with reality, but reason
has never played the defining role in the ways of men. The woke can
remain unreasonable longer than the reasonable can remain smug. Our
peasant from before learned that when he was eventually forced to
abandon his gods.
