Anything to do with the climate now has such a bad odor that most people
just assume all of it is a hoax. Years of lying to people about global
warming have discredited the field in the eyes of the public. That and
the true believers are nut. It turns out that the real threat was never
humans. <a

*A new study by researchers at the University of Texas, Austin found
that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is collapsing due to geothermal heat,
not man-made global warming.*

*Researchers from the UTA’s Institute for Geophysics found that the
Thwaites Glacier in western Antarctica is being eroded by the ocean as
well as geothermal heat from magma and subaerial volcanoes. Thwaites is
considered a key glacier for understanding future sea level rise.*

*UTA researchers used radar techniques to map water flows under ice
sheets and estimate the rate of ice melt in the glacier. As it turns
out, geothermal heat from magma and volcanoes under the glacier is much
hotter and covers a much wider area than was previously thought.*

*“Geothermal flux is one of the most dynamically critical ice sheet
boundary conditions but is extremely difficult to constrain at the scale
required to understand and predict the behavior of rapidly changing
glaciers,” UTA researchers wrote in their study, which was published in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.*

*The geothermal heat under the glaciers is likely a key factor in why
the ice sheet is currently collapsing. Before this study, it was assumed
that heat flow under the glacier was evenly distributed throughout, but
UTA’s study shows this is not the case. Heat levels under the glacier
are uneven, with some areas being much hotter than others.*

We have always been at war with Volcanic Global Warming.
