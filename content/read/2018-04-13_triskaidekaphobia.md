Since everyone will be spending the day indoors, hoping to avoid the bad
juju that comes with Friday the 13th, this podcast will be a helpful way
to pass the time. The superstition around Friday the 13th is a western
thing. Other cultures often count 13 among the lucky numbers. In the
West, 13 is universally bad, perhaps the result of Judas Iscariot being
the 13th guest to arrive at the last supper. It could also be from the
ancient Norse, who counted Loki as the 13th guest in Valhalla, upsetting
the perfect order of 12 gods.

Triskaidekaphobia is fear of the number 13,
while paraskevidekatriaphobia is fear of Friday the 13th. My assumption
is most people know the former and would get the reference. The latter
looks like a foreign word or maybe the cat walking across the keyboard,
so I went with the former. Reportedly, about 10% of Americans suffer
from the latter, but that seems like a lot. I guess “fear” could simply
be superstition. I know lots of people who joke about the day being bad
luck, so that seems more likely.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
