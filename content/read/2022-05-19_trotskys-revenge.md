One of the interesting revelations in Tucker Carlson’s book, Ship of
Fools, is that Bill Kristol said privately what he denied publicly about
the Iraq war. That is, the war was about Israel and not American
security. Saddam was never a threat to American interests in the region
but taking him out was good for Israel. The neocons have always denied
this, usually claiming it is anti-Semitic to suggest it, but every time
they get caught in a lie they squeal “anti-Semitism” so this is not new.

The thing is though, a schemer like Kristol could have been lying to
Carlson, hoping he stepped on the same landmines as Pat Buchanan.
Carlson was always a war skeptic and a natural conservative, so Bill
Kristol would have seen him as a threat. The main play of the second
generation neocons has always been the Hitler card. They look for some
way to accuse their opponents of being anti-Semites, so that the focus
shifts from the neocon schemers and onto the accusers.

Putting that aside, subsequent events suggest that the crusade against
Islam launched in the Bush years was never about Israel. The real target
for the neocons was the ancient enemy in the east, Russia.
Neoconservatism, after all, was born out of a hatred for Russia during
the Cold War. The cover story was that these radicals had turned on
communism, but in reality, they were reacting to what was happening on
the Left with regards to relations with the Soviet Union.

Soon after the fall of the Cold War, the neocons running foreign policy
under the first George Bush engineered the first Gulf War. They did this
by baiting Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait. The American ambassador
to Iraq at the time was April Glaspie, who met with Saddam before he
launched his invasion. It is clear from the notes that he was not
committed to war. It is also clear that Glaspie gave him the impression
that America was not committed to defending Kuwait.

Why would the neocons want a war with Iraq? It seems like a lifetime
ago, but Iraq was a longtime client of the Soviet Union. Once the Soviet
Union fell, the Russians were in no condition to help her allies as in
the past. This made it a perfect time to take this piece of the board.
Given the behavior of the neocons in Ukraine over the last decade, it is
not a stretch to think they baited Saddam into war. After all, they have
been trying to bait Russian into invading Ukraine.

If we look at the crusade against Islam as a proxy war against Russia,
the last thirty years of foreign policy adventures makes more sense. The
second war with Iraq was about finishing the job and preparing for the
planned attack on Iran, which so happens to be a Russia ally. The
creation of ISIS as a weapon against Syria, another ally of Russia, now
also makes sense. The occupation of Afghanistan never made sense as a
response to 9/11, but it did make a nice forward operating base.

Long forgotten in all of this is how the neocons pushed the Clinton
administration into bombing Serbia during the Balkan war. The Balkans
have always been a mess, so there was never a reason for America to take
sides. This should have been a European matter, worked out in endless
meetings, like everything else in Europe. Instead, the neocons pushed
for an aggressive stance toward Serbia, which so happens to be a
longtime Russian ally. There is a pattern here.

Fast forward to the present and the pattern is clear. The neocons
started the Russo-Georgian war by trying to bring Georgia into NATO.
Give or take, Georgia is about 3,000 miles from the North Atlantic, thus
making her an odd fit for a military alliance based in the North
Atlantic. That was never the point, of course. The point was to pick
away at the borders with the ancient enemy. NATO expansion has never
been about defense, but always about offense.

In more recent times, the neocons have tried to color revolution
Belarus, they have stirred up trouble in Kazakhstan and they are
probably involved in the tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Then
there is the Ukraine situation. Half of Washington has been taking
bribes from Ukrainian oligarchs, which has concealed the fact that the
neocons have been plotting trouble there for over a decade. The same
people behind the color revolution in the Obama years are in charge now.

The point of all of this has been to weaken Russia by nibbling away at
her border, forcing her to commit resources to all of these different
conflicts. At some point, the current government becomes too weak to
defend itself. Maybe with some outside help, the government falls. This
opens the door for regime change and the long dreamed of break up of
Russia. This is not idle speculation. A few years ago, the Rand
Corporation provide the
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">playbook</a> for those interested.

The old line about the neocons being Trotskyites was mostly a way to
point out that they were not conservatives in the traditional sense.
Many were communist in the middle of the last century. Their
“conversion” was never about the things that had long defined
conservatism, but rather the temporary needs of the moment. They cared
more about beating Russia in the Cold War than anything else. They
simply embraced the rest of the conservative program as a means to an
end.

One of the underappreciated aspects of the last five years is the exit
of the neocons from Buckley conservatism. They have their own
publications and regularly attack their old friends on the Right. Of
course, they were outlandishly opposed to trump and the pro-American
sentiments he embodied. Their primary complain was that he was soft on
Russia and Russian allies. This transformation suggest the paleocons
were right about the neocon conversion being less than genuine.

There may have been more to the Trotsky line. In radical politics, it
was long held that the Bolshevik revolution was hijacked by Stalin. The
Trotsky wing never forgave the Russians for allowing the revolution to
turn into Tsarism. This fueled the deep hatred for Russia among
Trotskyites of a certain persuasion. The
<a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/the-neoconservative-persuasion/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">neoconservative persuasion</a> was driven
by this animus in the Cold War. After the Cold War, it has driven by the
berserk obsession for Russia by the second wave of neocons.

What America, and by extension the West, has been experiencing over the
last thirty years is Trotsky’s revenge. Resentment at the failure of his
faction in the revolution was probably the second to last thing that
went through his head. His followers, however, have had it in the
forefront of their minds. The current generation of neocons, lacking the
intelligence to understand any of this, are simply left with a seething
hatred of Russia that has driven America foreign policy for a
generation.
