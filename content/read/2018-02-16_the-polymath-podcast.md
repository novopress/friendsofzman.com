It is a bit of slow news week, so this week I went hunting around for
odd stuff I find interesting. There’s always news to discuss, but not
all of it interests me. I can only follow politics for so long, before
I’m overcome with dark thoughts. The big story, as I go to post is the
Florida shooting, but those stories are always the same. The lunatic
slipped through the system, people wonder how it happened, the usual
suspect say the same things they said the last time. It’s a terrible
thing, but there’s nothing to be done about it.

I’m also of the mind that we have plenty of people doing topical stuff.
John Derbyshire does a one hour podcast on the news from a Dissident
Right perspective. Fash the Nation does several hours each week on the
news from an alt-right perspective. Then you have all of the YouTubers
and periscope doing news stuff. I’m probably better off sticking to the
topics that strike my fancy, even if they don’t fit neatly into a
thematic show each week.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
