For those interested in the demographic struggle, Japan is the place to
watch for clues about what comes next. From time to time, the news will
report that the Japanese are no longer having sex. By that they mean the
young people are no long reporting a high interest in sex. The Japanese
stopped having children in the 1970’s. Their total fertility rate fell
below replacement in that decade and has remained well below replacement
for going on five decades now.

That does not mean they stopped having sex in the 1970’s. It’s juts a
good starting point for exploiting why it is they are apparently the <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first asexual population</a>.
According the story, young Japanese have moved from not having children
to not getting married to now not bothering with sex. Of course, this
corresponds with the explosion of pornography and a porn culture in
Japan. The causal relationship between the two may or may not exist, but
the bet is they are connected.

Anyway, the West may be headed down the same path. At least the European
portion of the Occident. You have moves to <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ban sex</a> in states like
California. The point is <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">justice or vengeance,</a> it
is hard tell the difference, for male privilege. The University of
California <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SHSV"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has raced ahead</a> with a
policy of their own requiring affirmative consent, not just for sex, but
to every form of “physical sexual activity.” The goal is to invert the
normal sexual relationship, which will make normal sex criminal.

This is lunacy, of course, but it is related, most likely, to what is
happening in Japan. The collapse of maleness, probably due to a collapse
in testosterone, has upset the normal balance. Women, like dogs, need to
be on a leash held firmly by a confident male. Off the leash, the women
go crazy. The low-T males respond by investing their time into porn and
video games, thus making themselves less attractive to women. The result
is a world where all sex is either porn or rape.
