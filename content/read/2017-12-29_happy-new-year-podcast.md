I decided to do the very first New Year’s podcast while stinking drunk
and staggering around outside with strangers. It is the tradition, after
all, to get obliterated on December 31st, waiting for the calendar to
change. Well, I can only assume, as I have not been outside, much less
partying, on New Year’s Eve in decades.

In fact, I don’t recall the last time I was up past midnight on the big
night. I’m not really sure why I have no interest in the custom. I like
drinking and I like staying up late, but I never got into ringing in the
new year. In my youth it just seemed like a lot of work to accomplish
very little, so I was never interested in it. Instead, I’d watch some
Three Stooges reruns and make it an early night..

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard
format. Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the four longer segments
from the show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android commies can
take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on iTunes, which
means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones.
