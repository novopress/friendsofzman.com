A bit of a weird show this week. The post on Wednesday got me thinking
about how I would explain to someone what I think is happening in
Washington. That post relied on people understanding a lot of things
that would not be familiar to most, so they would need a quick
background before getting to the meat of the topic. Thinking about how
to do that led to the idea of doing a show on it.

One of the things that you see with people who arrive on this side of
the great divide is they often go through a crash course learning all
the stuff that was excluded from their education and political
understanding. Condensing that down into easily digestible bits is
probably a good project for someone, given that we are seeing millions
turn up on the edge of the great divide, looking for a lift over to this
side.

That really is something to savor. Trump gave a presser after the
chopper collided with the passenger jet in Washington and he put the
blame on diversity. It is not the first time he has said something like
this since he was inaugurated, but it is still shocking to hear a public
official say what had been prohibited a year ago. This administration is
saying things that got you booted from Twitter before Musk.

This is why the corporate takeover model works. Every company has a
culture, and that culture is reinforced by management. Inevitably when
new owners come in it means changes to the culture. To outsiders it does
not seem that important, but to the people inside it is shocking. Our
political system is being overhauled in the equivalent of a hostile
takeover, like greenmailing. Instead, it is orangemailing.
