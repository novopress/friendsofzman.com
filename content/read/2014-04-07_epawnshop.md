The so-called new economy is, in most cases, just the use of technology
to circumvent the rules and regulations of the old economy. By operating
on-line, they can escape state regulators.
<a href="https://www.borro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">This company</a> is a good example. it is hard to tell
from the site, but their marketing suggests they are an asset backed
lender. That means they lend to people who can pledge an asset that is
of greater value than the loan. That’s different from an underwriter,
which fund a purchase of an asset.

Pawn shops are almost as old as prostitution. Mosaic law addressed
lending, which in those days was exclusively asset based lending. The
Greeks and Romans had pawn brokers. English law is based on Roman law as
regards pawn brokers. In America, every state has laws regulating pawn
shops. The pawn shop owner has to undergo a background check and be
finger printed. They are required to keep detailed records of all items
taken in and get positive identification of the customers. The state
requires these records to be made available to police on demand.

That’s what’s puzzling about these on-line operations. Where are they
licensed and how can they do business across state lines? <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s an article</a> from a
couple of years ago on the growth of mega-pawn shops. It’s not hard to
see where this is headed. Local pawn dealer will start buying protection
from their state legislature. The Internet guys will try to do the same
and we get a replay of Tesla in New Jersey.

Anyway, it is a good example of how we are running out of places to
employ technology to squeeze out profits. The low hanging fruit from the
information age has been picked. We are now into the great settling out
as the dust clears. Just as the great fortunes of the industrial age
were built prior to the Great Depression, the great fortunes of the
Communications age have been built prior to the Great Recession. There
are a few plumbs to be picked and maybe ePawn is one of them, but the
pickings are slim.
