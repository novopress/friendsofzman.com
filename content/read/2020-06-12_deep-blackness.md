In this time of grieving and self-reflection, it is important for white
people to think about their whiteness. It is what George would have
wanted. In order to fully appreciate your whiteness, you must first
understand blackness. This is something that gets missed in all of these
discussions. Whiteness does not exist outside the context of blackness,
because white people simply don’t care about whiteness. In order for
them to care, they have to be surrounded by blackness.

Most white people, of course, have the good sense to not live around
blackness, so they struggle with their whiteness. The struggle sessions
at the company or college help, but they are not the same as
experiencing deep blackness. When you live in a place like Lagos, you
never stop experiencing blackness. It is all around you, like a fog that
never lifts. The show this week is a journey into blackness so you, a
white person, can understand blackness in order to understand your
whiteness.

The thing that white people never quite get about black people is black
people, especially the talented tenth, obsess over their blackness. The
rank and file are not reading books on their blackness or attending
lectures about blackness, but they still experience the world through
their blackness. The exception is the very narrow dealings they have
with other blacks. In their interpersonal relations with black, the fog
of their blackness tends to lift. Otherwise, it is always black for
them.

Of course, this is an exhausting way to live. It is why all of your
dealings with black people are tense, even with those who are nice.
There’s always that veil of blackness through which the black person
sees you. It’s why people from Africa or the Caribbean always strike
white people are super happy. Those blacks are not living in the fog of
blackness like American blacks. They find this obsession with blackness
bizarre and confusing, which is why they tend to not like American
blacks.

It’s also why the current ructions are so vexing to whites. Life has
never been better for blacks in America. Trump’s tweets about black
unemployment are is ridiculous, but it is a fact that the material life
of blacks was at a peak. Think back to the origins of the Black Lives
Matter movement and it started on the college campus. Privileged black
students began to agitate about their blackness. Here they are living
like royalty relative to most blacks and they are full of rage.

That’s the thing about black identity. Since it is entirely negative,
they can only assess their happiness relative to whites. No matter how
good they have it, they cannot be happy without the full attention of
whites. The only thing record unemployment did for blacks is give them
more interactions with whites and therefore a greater awareness of their
blackness. It turns out that black happiness is inversely proportional
to their interactions with white people. White fatigue is real.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
