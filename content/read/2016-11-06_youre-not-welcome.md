One of the bedrock principles of Anglo-Saxon conservatism was the belief
that all people have a right to associate with whoever they wish, as
long as it is not for criminal purposes. All rights have limitations so
forbidding convicted criminals from associating with other criminals is
a reasonable exception. In the modern age, people can get a restraining
order to have the state prevent someone from associating with them.
These are reasonable exceptions that have no impact on the lives of the
law abiding citizen.

This presents a problem for fanatics as people have the ability to
ignore them by refusing to be around them. The gays that go around
harassing Christian bakers, for example, are simply using the power of
the state to force themselves into the lives of those who would
otherwise ignore them. The goal being to drive these people out of the
public space, assuming they take their beliefs with them. This is not
possible when people have freedom of association and it is respected by
the state.

The trouble with public accommodation laws is they turn Jim Crow on its
head. Instead of forcing people to discriminate, the law now forces you
to associate with people you don’t like. This is just another way of
violating people’s right of free association. The result is a
metastasizing list of laws telling business with whom they can and
cannot conduct business. One groups morals imposed on everyone.

The trouble is people naturally self-segregate. Blacks like to be around
blacks. Rich people prefer to be around rich people. Women at a party
will congregate in one room while the men are in another. It is human
nature. There’s also the fact that people notice things. If you are
hiring people to work in your plant, you will notice that the Spanish
guys tend to work harder than the black guys. These observations about
the differences in groups reinforce our natural impulse to
self-segregate.

This is problem for the New Religion as they insist that all people are
the same and that the righteous never ever notice otherwise. A key part
of the New Religion is the relentless hunting down of the heretics and
non-believers so they are always on the lookout for people noticing.
This is what has forced <a
href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1523/general-questions-about-the-airbnb-community-commitment?topic=533"
target="_blank">Airbnb to institute a  policy</a> where all of their
hosts swear loyalty to the one true faith.

> #### **What is the Airbnb Community Commitment?**
>
> Earlier this year, we launched a comprehensive effort to fight bias
> and discrimination in the Airbnb community. As a result of this
> effort, we’re asking everyone to agree to the following Community
> Commitment (beginning November 1, 2016) in order to continue using
> Airbnb:
>
> *I agree to treat everyone in the Airbnb community—regardless of their
> race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender
> identity, sexual orientation, or age—with respect, and without
> judgment or bias.*
>
> #### **How do I accept the commitment?**
>
> On or after November 1, we’ll show you the commitment when you log in
> to or open the Airbnb website, mobile or tablet app and we’ll
> automatically ask you to accept.
>
> #### **What if I decline the commitment?**
>
> If you decline the commitment, you won’t be able to host or book using
> Airbnb, and you have the option to cancel your account. Once your
> account is canceled, future booked trips will be canceled. You will
> still be able to browse Airbnb but you won’t be able to book any
> reservations or host any guests.

Notice the language. It’s not a *rule* that you must *obey*. No, it is a
*commitment* because you want to be saved, don’t you? Of course you do.
Who wouldn’t? You’ll also notice the appeal to community. It’s hard to
know if the fascist borrowed this from our Puritans or it was the other
way around, but totalitarians love the insider/outsider image. The good
people are inside. The bad people are outside. You don’t want to be
outside so that means adhering to the rules of the community, or else.

This commitment to community means you renounce your rights as a human
being, because you cease to be an individual in the community. Your
identity is the community and that means you have to open your home to a
group of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_people_(New_Age_belief)"
target="_blank">star seeds</a> or
<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/15kdTQWTch0/hqdefault.jpg"
target="_blank">satanists</a> and pretend to like it. Your property
rights no longer exist. Your freedom of association no longer exists. If
you wake up and your boarder is standing over you with a meat clever, so
be it. The community will carry on.

Airbnb is doomed if they try to enforce this, of course. Instead, they
will pretend to care and leave it alone. This is just so they don’t get
sued. That does not mean hosts will not get sued. You can be sure that
buggerers are scanning the site looking for Christians to harass and
then sue. The result, like the Christian bakers, is the religious will
retreat further from the public space. That’s the whole point of this.
