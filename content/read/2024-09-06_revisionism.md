Tucker Carlson recently hosted a man calling himself Darryl Cooper to
discuss a range of things, including alternative narratives of the
Second World War. Cooper also calls himself MartyrMade online and hosts
the The MartyrMade Podcast. He specializes in historical revisionism and
the history of items that get little attention, like Jim Jones and the
People’s Temple in the 1970’s.

The great and the good are in a panic, because Cooper, while on the
Tucker Carlson show, suggested that Churchill was not the hero the
official narrative claims, but more likely the villain of the story.
Since the show aired there has been a steady stream of toadies and
lickspittles pointing and shrieking at both Tucker and Cooper. By now
everyone knows the drill.

As someone pointed out in response to one of the pointers and shriekers,
the official narrative around the Second World War is closer to a
religion than history. It is tangled up in the founding myths of the
United States. It is part of the larger narrative that forms the
identity of the American ruling class. To question any part of this
narrative is to question the moral legitimacy of the ruling elite.

As an aside, Cooper is not breaking new ground regarding Churchill. Pat
Buchanan wrote a book titled, *Churchill, Hitler And The Unnecessary
War*, which sought to break the “cult of Churchill” that had come to
dominate the American elite. The same people freaking out now over
Cooper, freaked out of Buchanan, so the freakout works as confirmation
of both men’s central claim.

The thing is though, the Second Word War is just one part of a larger
narrative that makes up the great American myth of existence. The
twentieth century saw a rewriting of American history to recast the
founding, the war between the states and the emergence of the Global
American Empire in the context of a great mission for which the American
people have been tasked.

That is the show this week. It is not a comprehensive thesis on revising
the American story, but more of a starting point for looking at the key
events that make up the myth of the American founding and the myth of
American purpose. After all, if a key item like the story of WW2 is
fake, then it is reasonable to assume the story around other key events
of the myth are fake as well.
