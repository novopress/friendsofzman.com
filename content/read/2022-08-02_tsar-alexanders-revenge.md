On the surface, Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, which has put the Chinese
on a war footing, does not make much sense. Pelosi is an old woman who
barely knows where she is most of the time. It is an open secret that
she will be retiring at the end of the year, assuming her party does not
hold the House. If Washington wanted to communicate something to the
Taiwanese leadership outside of official channels, they could do it any
number of low profile ways.

The White House has tried to sell this trip as the doings of Pelosi and
not connected with administration policy. They told their official
organs that the military tried to dissuade her from the trip. On the eve
of her landing, word has gone forth that there are contacts between the
PLA and the US military to avoid an accident. Presumably, this means the
American side is sure that the Chinese will not shoot down her plane or
launch a preemptive attack against American assets.

If there is no reason for Pelosi to be visiting Taiwan and the
administration was opposed to the trip, then why is she going? The most
likely reason is that this is part of a global disruption campaign aimed
at Russia and her allies. China has sided with the Russians over Ukraine
and the sanctions regime imposed by the West. This trip is payback for
not going along with Washington. The message being sent is that there is
a cost to taking the side of Russia in this war.

Looked at as part of a pattern, this makes the most sense. Washington
has been stirring up trouble in Syria. They have recently instigated
conflict between Serbia and the breakaway area called Kosovo. It is
suspected that Washington is trying to provoke another war between
Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno- Karabakh region that
separates the two countries. This provocation of China is just another
part of a
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10014.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">global destabilization campaign</a> aimed
at Russia.

In this context, Ukraine is not a cause of the war waged against Russia
by the Global American Empire, but an extension of it. The effort to
build a Ukrainian army that could regain lost territory and perhaps
threaten Russia proper was part of a long term plan to break up Russia.
The recent effort to color revolution the president of Belarus has been
forgotten, but it too was part of this larger mission. The current world
crisis is part of a plan to break up Russia and reorder Eurasia.

It sounds a bit farfetched but look back to the start of the war. There
was a flurry of stories all based around the idea of breaking up Russia.
Here is <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-01/is-breaking-up-russia-the-only-way-to-end-its-imperialism"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> claiming that the only way
to end Russian imperialism is disaggregation. Here is <a
href="https://unherd.com/thepost/how-the-war-could-lead-to-the-break-up-of-russia/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">something</a> in a British publication on
the same theme. The National Interest really likes the <a
href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/breakup-will-russia-splinter-over-war-ukraine-201728"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">idea</a> of breaking up Russia. The
Atlantic had its <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">take</a> on the idea. The rather
implausible idea of breaking up Russia is an immensely popular idea in
certain circles.

This ongoing hybrid was against Russia now taking center stage does
explain why so many senior people were taking bribes from Ukraine.
People forget the Trump impeachment show, but all of the witnesses
against him had weird names, spoke little English and had connections to
high ranking Washington players. It was a puzzle at the time, but looked
at in the current context, it makes sense. Trump was impeached because
he risked the Ukraine gambit.

This also explains the weird stance toward China. It has been clear for
a long time that China poses a serious long term threat to America.
Donald Trump ran on this topic and as president tried to get tough with
China. On the other hand, official Washington fought him at every turn.
Most just assumed that bribery was the issue. High ranking people like
Joe Biden had been proudly taking bribes from China. Nancy Pelosi has
also been on the take. Now both are trying to provoke China.

This schizophrenic relationship with China makes more sense when seen as
a secondary issue for the foreign policy community. They opposed Trump
for political and cultural reasons, but they specifically opposed his
China policy because it threatened their Russia policy. They do not want
a cold war with China as that shifts the focus from their war on Russia.
This incident is just an effort to pressure China of Russia, not a long
term strategy to confront China.

It may also be time to rethink the crusades against Islam. The general
consensus was that was part of a scheme to turn Israel into the regional
hegemon. That may have been viewed as a convenient narrative. It is well
known that conservative white people have a fetish for Israel. The real
prize, however, was Russia. The wars in the Muslim world were about
targeting Russian clients. Syria, Iran and Iraq have all had strong
relations with Russia going back generations.

This all may sound farfetched but consider that American foreign policy
has been controlled by the neoconservatives since the Cold War. It has
been a revolving door between neocon think tanks and the State
Department. Administrations change, but policy does not change very
much. This has come into focus under Biden, who is too infirmed to
challenge the system. His administration is crawling with the same
people who promoted the wars of the Bush years.

The current crisis may simply be part of a long term strategy by the
semi-permanent foreign policy establishment to get revenge on Russia.
The Cold War ended thirty years ago, but the desire to get revenge for
the <a href="https://strangeside.com/czar-alexander-ii/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">assassination</a> of Tsar Alexander II transcends the
current age for these people. Neoconservatism, whatever it was, is now a
death cult organized around the destruction of Russia. As a result, the
Global American Empire exists only as a weapon in that war.
