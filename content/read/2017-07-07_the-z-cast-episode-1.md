Here is the debut episode of what I will call the Z-Cast, until I come
up with a better name or I am chased off the internet. It is a first
effort so it has all the flaws of every first effort, but you have to
start somewhere. Every actor has his first role. Every surgeon has his
first operation. Every hit-man has his first kill. I have a long way to
go between here and good, but Iâ€™m hoping it is fun learning how to make
the trip. Of course, comments and commentary are encourage.
