For some reason, things became a real grind for me the last couple of
days. I’ve been so busy with the day job, I think it is just starting to
wear on me. As a result, I’m not in the best frame of mind and that, in
turn, makes me less productive. This week I decided to do some lighter
material in order to lighten my mood a bit. It really did not work, as
recording last night was a real grind. I had to start over so many times
I started to lose track, so if the sound is not the best at some points,
that’s why.

Yesterday’s post about *the tax* was another product of having a bad
aura. I stopped to get coffee on the way to the office and the locals
were doing their thing. At some point I thought to myself, “Why do we
have to tolerate this?” I suspect lots of normal men have this thought
cross their mind these days. Here in Lagos, it is not just the natives,
but the imports that tax the soul. Our betters are dumping the United
Nations here, as if we don’t have enough trouble. Maybe they just hate
Lagos.

That said, you can’t walk around with a lemon in your pocket, unless you
are a left-wing female, so you have to find ways to lift the spirits.
This week’s show started out to be a normal grab bag type show, but then
a theme emerged, I had some Xirl science stuff ready, so I included
that, even though it did not quite fit with the theme. On the other
hand, the crap papers that come from the grievance studies people are
excellent examples of the show title. Close enough for a dissident
podcast.

The segment on smart toilets was still on my mind when I woke up this
morning. I just can’t stop thinking about the meetings that go on around
designing a smart toilet. I keep imagining a managerial type talking
about the opportunity to collect data on people’s bathroom habits, which
they can then monetize by selling to advertisers. You know that will be
one result of the “connected home.” You will go in to do your thing and
an ad for product will appear in the bowl water or start playing through
a speaker.

This already happens with mobile phones. Those who travel a lot have
surely got the mysterious text message welcoming you to an airport or a
location. It will not be long before Alexa welcomes you home by offering
you a deal on product. You’ll need to answer a survey to get your smart
toilet to let you lift the lid. Whenever I read about the connected him,
I immediately think that the future will be crap. OK, that is the last
crap joke of the week. Please remember to tip your waitresses.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
