On the show Wednesday with Paul Ramsey, we talked about how Trump is a
bookend for Nixon containing the period of peak managerialism. The
managers ran Nixon out of town for the crime of being a strong executive
and now Trump, the strong executive, is running the managers out of
town. It remains to be seen if that is how it plays out, but it is a
good way to containerize this period of history.

Doing the show, it occurred to me that we can do something similar with
populism in that it was populism that gave birth to managerialism. When
you look at the birth of progressivism, it started with the populist
movements. It peaked with the FDR administration, which is the rise of
the managers. Now we see a populist movement rising to smash what was
set off by original populism.

Here is where you see the two faces of populism, democratic and
authoritarian or anarchic versus orderly. Of course, it is a fact of
history that democracy leads to authoritarianism, so this long cycle
dating to the 19th century follows a predictable course, just more
slowly and mildly. The synthesis that will result from it may be a
modern version of what the Framers imagined.

Anyway, that is for some posts this week. The show this week is a review
of and comment upon populism in its many forms, as well as the criticism
of it in light of the events unfolding in Washington. It is one of those
shows that meanders around a bit, so it has no main point, just a main
theme. Perhaps if the topic is of interest, I can do a more formal deep
dive into the topic.
