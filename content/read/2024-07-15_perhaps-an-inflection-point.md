By now, everything that can be said about the assassination attempt on
Donald Trump over the weekend has been said in every way that can be
said. Thanks to cameras being everywhere all the time, most facts were
known in real time. It did not take long for the internet to identify
the shooter and then for the authorities and their media platforms to
confirm the details. An iron rule of life is that it is better to be
lucky than good and Trump is the living embodiment of it.

Of course, the same is true to a degree for the shooter. The official
story will be that he was a loner, a victim of bullying, who just
snapped. Just as the FBI swears every serial killer is a middle-aged
white guy, they swear ever assassin is a loner. Regardless of his
motivations, many things needed to fall into place for him to get on
that roof and get a chance for the glory he was seeking. Ninety-nine
percent of the time these guys are caught before they get out of the
car.

Putting that aside, what matters right now is the politics of this
event. Sensing that this was not good for their side, the regime rolled
the dice and sent Biden out to “address the nation” from the Oval
Office. Anytime they put him out for public view there is the risk he
reminds the world that he is a desiccated husk. Even when he avoids
looking like a nursing home patient, it is clear that it is taking all
of his remaining energy to get out the words they have on the screen in
front of him.

It is the habit of the regime to cry out in agony as they attack, but
then that tactic fails, they go for a different version. They attack
then call for peace before they think the other side has a chance to
respond. For close to a decade they have been calling for the death of
Trump and his supporters, but now all of a sudden, they think it is time
to put aside our differences and come together as brothers. Note that
there was no remorse in Biden’s call for unity over the weekend.

Imagine you are walking down the street, and a guy runs up and smacks
you in the head, a thing common in coastal cities. Just as you are about
to respond, he starts yelling, “why can’t we just get along bro?” Then a
crowd forms up demanding that you accept the guy’s offer of peace and
reconciliation. It is absurd, but it is how the progressive mind
operates. These are people with no scruples and no self-awareness, so
they are incapable of remorse.

It is a hollow gesture, and the regime will soon be back to
anathematizing Trump and everyone associated with him. When they call
Trump an “existential threat to their democracy” they mean it and they
are correct. What they mean by “their democracy” is rule by the
semi-permanent ruling class of credentialed experts and policy makers
who hide behind the democratic process. If the voters back populist
candidates like Trump, then the system loses its legitimacy.

It is not that Trump will usher in revolutionary change if elected. It
has never been about that for the regime. They could have cut a good
deal with him at any time. It is what Trump represents that terrifies
them. What these people fear is a system whereby elected officials
compete for public support and then have the power to pass laws they
think are popular with the public. They hate this idea for the same
reason they were scandalized by the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/06/chevron-doctrine-supreme-court-ruling"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">overturning</a> of the Chevron deference.

This is one reason why there will be no going back. This is the new
normal and will remain so until one side destroys the other side
utterly. We have been in a cold civil war, as John Derbyshire has called
it, for a long time. The war has gotten hotter over the last decade and
it got very hot over the weekend. It may cool down a bit over the next
few weeks, but by the time the Democratic convention rolls around, Joe
Biden will be threatening drone strikes on your town again.

Of course, demographic reality plays a role. Trump is symbolically the
voice of white America right now. He may live the gangster lifestyle,
but he will still only get ten percent of the black vote. Every major
black celebrity will take turns calling him and his voters the usual
scare words. On one side of the civil war is the ruling class white
progressives, the Alawites of America, leading the nonwhite hordes that
will soon be a majority, against the shrinking heritage America.

On the other hand, parts of that shrinking heritage America were
radicalized when they saw Trump rise like El Cid from the stage floor.
It was not so much that the scales fell from their eyes about what is
happening, but that they were reminded of the basic truth of what it
means to be an American. It is not the Bravo Sierra that comes from
creepy weirdos like Ben Shapiro. What it means to be an American is when
the bullets start flying, you run toward the shooter.

A Russian blogger got it right. “In the eyes of the US population, Trump
will be promoted as the living embodiment of that very “American Dream”
– a self-made billionaire, an American patriot, whom his enemies tried
to kill for his love for his homeland, while being protected from all
troubles by the Higher Powers.” For many in heritage America, Trump
stopped being a politician on that stage and became a symbol around
which they can rally against the forces of darkness.

That is when the battle is joined. Until now, the cold civil war has
been a one-sided affair, because white people did not know there was a
war. They told each other that the actions of the regime were for money
or power. Now they are starting to sense it is about something else. The
“existential threat” is not against “their democracy” but against
heritage Americans. If the regime thinks killing Trump is funny, they
will have no qualms about killing you and your family.

Assassinations are often triggering events. The most famous was the
assassination of Archduke Frans Ferdinand. That kicked off the Great
War. The assassination of Kennedy kicked off the cold civil war that
still rages today. Perhaps in time the failed assassination of Trump
will be seen as the turning point in the cold civil war, the point when
the good guys finally figured out that they are under attack and begin
to organize a resistance against the gathering darkness.
