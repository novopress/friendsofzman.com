Consider this:

> “There is another class of coloured people who make a business of
> keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race
> before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living
> out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of
> advertising their wrongs — partly because they want sympathy and
> partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to
> lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.”
>
> *– Booker T. Washington*, 1911
