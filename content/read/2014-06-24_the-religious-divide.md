Way back in the olden thymes, “spiritual” people eschewed traditional
religion, in favor of pseudo-paganism and Eastern mysticism. Along with
it came sub-cults like saving the whales or saving the environment.
Concern for people and things over the horizon is the hallmark of new
age religion. Most of these people were miserable to their families and
friends, but they had nothing but love for mother earth, nature and
oppressed people living far away.

All of that nonsense from the 60’s and 70’s was just religion for people
who liked the benefits of public piety, but were not into any of the
sacrifices. They had special outfits to wear in public, signaling their
goodness. They ate strange foods and got into meditation and yoga.
Bumper stickers were a big thing. it was a way for them to impose their
values on you without taking an risk. That’s the thing with the
self-righteous and publicly pious. It grace without sacrifice for them.

Still, they were a minor nuisance, for the most part. Cleaning up rivers
and protecting wildlife is the sort of stuff rich societies can do
without causing too much trouble. It is what economist call
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public goods</a>. Despite the
fact the people behind these efforts were mostly monomaniacal weirdos,
like Ralph Nader, the goals appealed to people’s Christian sense of
duty.  It’s the same way the social-welfare laws tag along on the
people’s sense of Christian charity.

This arrangement started to change in the 1990’s. Bill Clinton felt it
necessary to be open about his Christian faith. It was, in part, to make
inroads into the South, but also appealed to northern Catholics. By 2000
Al Gore was dismissive of religion entirely while Bush was the
Evangelical. That’s the source of the great divide that has roiled the
nation ever since. People who worship the old gods versus those who
worship the new gods and have zero tolerance for the old gods.

Obama comes along in 2008 and is clearly non-Christian. Maybe he is a
Muslim or maybe he is simply not religious. His membership in the crazy
black church hardly qualifies as religious. The clear message was that
unlike the people who put Bush in office, Obama was not a Christian. The
last election featured a man who never attends services and a man who
belongs to a weird cult that is alien to the Judeo-Christian traditions
of America.

The point of all of this is to underscore just how far Christianity has
fallen in public estimation. In 1980, Reagan seeded his talks with
references to the Bible, on the assumption everyone would know what he
meant. His opponent was a deeply religious man who felt comfortable
discussing his relationship to God on television. Today, it would seem
strange to see a presidential candidate discussing his relationship with
God or his duties to his church as a Christian man.

One thing you learn when reading about population genetics is religion
is near universal. We have evidence of religious practice going back as
far as we have evidence of modern human activity. Science thinks
religion evolved as one of the first human traits. If you take a step
back and look at religion as a subgroup of mass movements, then it is
even more obvious that faith and belief are necessary human traits that
are integral to our understanding of the world.

Religion was most likely the first solution to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free rider problem</a>. Not
only does guilt and moral suasion push the free loader to pull his
weight, it justifies taking harsh action against those who take more
than they give. Belief in the common gods and common morality would have
obvious reproductive advantages. A natural bias toward religiosity
would, over many generations, bake belief into the human animal. Like
all traits, it would manifest itself more prominently in some and less
so in others.

That brings me back to the collapse of Christianity in America. Take a
look at <a
href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/125999/mississippians-go-church-most-vermonters-least.aspx"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">church attendance by state</a>.
Where are you more likely to find, for example, global warming fanatics?
Vermont or Mississippi? If you look at the bottom ten states, there you
find the most deeply committed liberals and the most deeply committed
warmists. Gaia worship, manifested as climate concern, is the religion
filling the void left my Christianity for the people least connected to
Christian faith and heritage.

Whether you want to call AGW the master cult, encompassing the lesser
cults of environmentalism, or you lump all of it into the same bucket
with the other progressive fads, there’s no escaping the religious
overtones to all of it. <a
href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/11/13/2938961/red-states-climate-deniers/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s an interesting bit</a>
from a hard core believer site called Think Progress. These are the sort
of folks who invest a lot of time counting heretics. Their map is
revealing. It is not just party preference dividing the nation. It is
*religion*.

The question is whether it was the vacuum left by the collapse of
Christianity in these areas that allowed this pagan faith to spread or
do the causal arrows point in the other direction? The American Left has
been hostile to Christianity since the end of World War II, mostly in
order to include Jews in their cause. Perhaps as the people of these
areas became more liberal, church attendance dropped and these weird
fads spread or maybe as Christianity died, the people went crazier.
