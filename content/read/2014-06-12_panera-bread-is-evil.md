Everyone in business has had the customer from Hell. Often, the
employees get stuck dealing with them, while the owners or managers see
only the revenue. There are time when a customer is so demanding, so
expensive, that the only choice is to cut them loose and let them haunt
someone else. It turns out that Panera Bread is one of those
customers.  So much so <a

account</a> saying “no amount of money is worth it.”

*Panera Bread Co.’s lead ad agency, Cramer-Krasselt, has resigned its
account after two years with Panera, saying it was “much too much even
in this crazy business.”*

*An internal memo issued this morning by Chicago-based Cramer-Krasselt
Chairman and CEO Peter Krivkovich and obtained by Advertising Age
portrays a relationship between the agency and Panera that was fraught
with tension.*

*The memo cites as reasons for ending the relationship the “constant
last-minute shifts in direction, the behind-the-scenes politics, the
enormous level of subjectivity that disregards proof of performance.”*

*Cramer-Krasselt said that “in the end, no amount of money makes it
worthwhile.” However, the memo added that the agency still believes that
Panera Bread is a “wonderful brand” that delivers on its food sourcing
and quality promises.*

*“Many of us will continue to eat there. Because it’s that good,” the
memo said. “But enough is enough.”*

My goodness. I did not think it was possible to offend the sensibilities
of ad men.

I’ve run into companies like this. They make it so hard to do business
with them you eventually walk away from the account. I’ve never actually
fired a customer, but I have systematically ignored them so they will go
away on their own. Another trick is to raise rates so high they go
looking for some other source. If they stay around you at least have the
margin to make the account profitable. Sometimes, you just have to fire
the customer, as there is no way to make it work.
