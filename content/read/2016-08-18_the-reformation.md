ways is today’s world like the Reformation?” caught my attention.

Somewhere in the comments, Steve Sailer brought up the comparison
between the printing press and the interwebs, which is the obvious and
logical one. The impact of the printing press on the Reformation is
often dismissed, as its impact on Western culture is complicated and
hard to understand so modern historians focus on the religious
angle. That way they can say bad things about Christians, which is still
a lot of fun for the people of the New Religion.

Still, the printing press is not the meteor that killed the
dinosaurs. The Black Plague is the meteor, but the printing press is one
of the first shock waves to emit from it. It’s hard for us, in our age,
to imagine a world in which most everyone was illiterate. Even members
of the ruling class could make it to adulthood without ever having
learned to read. Many members of the clergy were functionally illiterate
as they had no reason to read. There was nothing for them to read, even
if they had the desire.

The printing press did a few things. The most obvious is it made
literacy much more valuable to the commoner. Therefore, more commoners
tried to master the basics of reading and writing. Cheap printed
material suddenly made literacy a valuable, but attainable thing, so we
got more literate people, which vastly expanded the number of people
contributing to the wealth of human knowledge. In a short time Sven
could learn about the innovations in French plow technology, because he
got a scroll on it from the tinker.

That’s where the comparison to the internet falls apart. Getting a
billion people on-line is not unlocking a great store of human
potential. Mostly it allowed a billion dimwits to fill the available
space with inane chatter. Spend five minutes watching cable news and you
can’t help but long for the days when men got their news from newspapers
and the town meeting. That’s not to dismiss the value of having the
Library of Alexandria at our fingertips. It’s just that there was not a
lot of untapped intellect sitting around in 1975.

The key comparison, maybe, is the speed that information moves. By the
Middle Ages, the state and the Church had evolved systems to control the
flow of information. If the lesser nobles were unhappy, they could only
conspire with one another, which could only happen within the system.
That’s easy to root out with spies and treachery. The printing press
allowed one pissed off guy to spread his word quickly and do so well
outside the official channels. Cheap printed pamphlets made it easy for
a disgruntled minor figure to spill the beans on his superiors, to the
wider masses.

The thing is, it’s not the information getting loose or the speed it
travels. It is how the current structures can respond to it. The
printing press exposed the great weakness of the Church and the state.
They were sclerotic when it came to reading and reacting to new
information. They evolved in an age of handwritten scrolls and private
couriers. They lacked the tools and the awareness to operate in a world
in which information moves quickly (relative to the age) and
*indiscriminately*.

None of this was immediate. The printing press was 15th century and the
16th century was a pretty good age for the ruling elite of the West. By
the 17th century, however, the wheels came off the cart. By the 18th
century the English speaking world was adapted to an age in which
information moves around quickly and indiscriminately. The Continent
followed in the 18th century so by the 19th the West had a ruling system
and a cognitive elite fully evolved to succeed in the age of the written
word.

This is where one can find a point of comparison to our own age. The
volume of information is obviously way higher today than a few decades
ago, but much of it is bad information so we very well may be *less*
informed. The real impact of the technological revolution is the ability
of the ruling class to respond. The old ways of hiding things from the
public and preventing trouble makers from spilling the beans to the
public are not very useful in an age when someone can put the total
output of an organization onto a thumb drive.

Defenders of the status quo inevitably have to rely upon size to carry
the day. They have the the monopoly of force and the institutions to
apply it. The challenger has to rely on speed, agility and cunning. If
the big guy is just as fast as the small guy, the big guy always wins.
What the technological revolution has done is give challengers to the
status quo an edge in speed and agility. Hillary Clinton controls the
mass media, yet she struggled to put away Sanders and is struggling to
deal with Trump.

This is not a perfect comparison, but if you are looking for a way to
link the current age to the Reformation, that’s the place to start.
