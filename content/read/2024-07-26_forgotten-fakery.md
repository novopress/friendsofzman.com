I was unsure what to do for a show this week. The nonstop firehose of
craziness from the political class has fried my brain a bit. That and
the events of the last week have broken the gauge on my clown meter. The
absurdity of the Kamala Harris campaign on the heels of Nursing Home Joe
getting bumped off in a midnight coup highlights the utter fakeness of
our politics.

Instead of trying to make any sense of it, I just turned the mic on and
started talking for an hour in a drug fueled stream of consciousness.
Okay, there were no drugs involved, even though drugs would make it
easier to follow the election. Instead, I meandered around from one
topic to another, all revolving around the fact that our politics have
been fake and gay for a long time.

In fact, I was going to call the show “Fake & Gay” but that ran into
problems with the platforms I post this to, so I went with something
less salty. That is, however, the prevailing sentiment of the show. It
is not just that things are fake now, but they have been fake for a long
time. What we are seeing now is the approach to peak fakeness, which
most likely comes just before collapse.

That said, whenever we think we have reach to limit of absurdity in our
politics, our rulers find another gear. That seems to be true with the
fakery. Obama seemed like the ultimate model of the banal, superficial
politician. Now here we have Harris who is nothing but a cackle and
pantsuit. She is the DEI version of Hilary, which means a cheap replica
of the real thing, but in brown.
