**Notes:** The Monday Taki
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/finnish-on-a-high-note/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is up. This week it is a deep
dive into the life of TikTok star and Finnish Prime Minister Sanna
Marin. Sunday Thoughts is on holiday, but there are two new posts behind
the green door about my weekend adventures. There is a longer analysis
of what is happening in the Ukraine war and a review of the heretical
movie, The Northman.

For a long time, Professor John Mearsheimer has been making the point
that the war in Ukraine can easily lead to a much larger war. In fact,
it could lead to a global war, maybe even a nuclear war. After all, the
United States is provoking a nuclear power over the Ukraine and it is
provoking nuclear powers that support Russia. China and India are both
nuclear powers and both back Russia.
[Here](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/playing-fire-ukraine) is
Mearsheimer’s latest analysis of how things can get very bad very fast.

One of the problems with this sort of analysis is it assumes both sides
remain as they are in terms of the abilities and points of view. The
great unknown unknown in all wars is how the two sides will evolve in
terms of how they see the conflict, themselves and their opponents. The
actions and reactions of the players in a war creates a dynamic that is
impossible to even think about in advance. The race to the sea at the
start of the Great War is a good example of the unknowable unknowns.

We can already see this in the Ukraine. It is clear that Russia, the
Ukrainian leaders and Europe expected a quick settlement. Zelensky made
concessions at the start and was pretty close to taking the deal on
offer from Russia. This deal was pretty much the old deal called the
Minsk Accords. Then London and Washington intervened to sabotage
negotiations, which came to a sudden halt. The West unleashed a tsunami
of economic attacks on the Russian economy.

This forced the Russians to reevaluate their operation. Over six months
they have switched from a short and limited war that would hopefully end
in a peace deal, to a long war of attrition. The Russians are now slowly
obliterating the Ukrainian army, in an artillery based meatgrinder. They
also have changed their goals. There is little doubt that Russia will
take most of Ukraine now. What they will leave as Ukraine will be a
land-locked state with limited resources.

This has in turn created a new dynamic on the Western side. The reckless
flood of weapons into Ukraine has now given way to a form of terrorism.
Washington and London are now helping the Ukrainians target civilian
targets in the Donbass. They have launched sabotage attacks in the
Crimea and shelled a nuclear plant. None of these are effective military
operations. They are intended to create havoc for the Russians and in
the case of the nuke plant, possibly kill a lot of civilians.

The other reason for Washington to have Ukraine launch these sorts of
attack is in the hope they will provoke a response. The facts on the
ground are only going to get worse and public support in the West has
started to collapse. Normal people do not care about the Ukraine, but
they care about food prices and energy bills. The typical German does
not see why his government should send billions to the crooks in Ukraine
while he has to take cold showers to save energy.

If the Russians respond to these civilian attacks with an attack on
civilian targets in the Ukraine, so the thinking goes, then public
outrage in the West will bring opinion back around to supporting the
war. A meltdown at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station would
contaminate half of Ukraine. Western media would blame it on Russia,
which would then warrant greater involvement in the war. This is the
sort of lunacy that no one can plan for or even contemplate in advance.

Now we have a new unknowable unknown in the mix. The assassination of
Darya Dugina, by Ukrainian terrorists, is the sort of escalation that
can set off a dangerous dynamic in this war. Darya Dugina is the
daughter of Alexander Dugin, the most important intellectual in the
world today. His ideas about a post-Cold War East are credited with
shaping the world view of Putin and his supporters. The attack was meant
for him but killed his daughter instead.

There is no question that the attack was done by professionally trained
assassins and that those assassins were working on behalf of the West.
The Russians will blame this on Washington and London because they are
not stupid. They will see this as Washington personalizing this dispute.
That could very well mean they take the same view and we begin to see
car bombings in Western capitals. The neocons better hire food tasters
and install radiation detectors in their homes.

One of the early warnings about dumping arms in Ukraine is they could
easily get into the hands of gangsters and terrorist. The Ukrainian are
the most corrupt people on earth, so they have been selling this stuff
as fast as they get it. Now imagine Russia letting Javelin missiles fall
into the hands of Berlin-based Islamists who would like to do something
big, like take out the motorcade of Olaf Scholtz. The idiots who cooked
up the Dugin caper just put everyone’s name on a list.

This is exactly what Mearsheimer has been warning of for months. While
everyone would celebrate a car bombing campaign against the neocons,
these things never go as planned and quickly become a new problem.
Killing Dugin would have angered Russia, but killing his daughter
infuriates the world. It underscores the fact that Western leaders are
gangsters without scruples. They will kill everyone if that is what it
takes to reach the end times they are pursuing.

In the end, the larger story here is not the dynamics of war or how
great powers can easily maneuver themselves into conflict. The real
issue is the danger of having large empires ruled by alien elites. If
the people running the American empire cared at all about the people,
this never would have come to pass. They do no care so they do not think
about the consequences to the people. It turns out that giving dangerous
sociopaths like the neocons access to power is suicidal.
