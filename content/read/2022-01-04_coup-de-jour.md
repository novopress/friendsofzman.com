One of the iron laws of the universe is that whatever the America Left
is warning about is usually something they are plotting. Alternatively,
whatever they are accusing others of doing is something they have
already done. The Russian collusion stuff is the most recent example of
this. They accused Trump of plotting with a foreign government, the
Russians, but we learned it was official Washington all mobbed up with
the Ukrainians, Chinese and anyone else with extra cash.

Of course, for the last year the ruling class has been yammering about
the insurrection and the ongoing threat to “our” democracy. Meanwhile,
they have been dragging people off to secret dungeons, harassing
citizens for their politics, throwing people off social media and all
the things we associate with a thug regime. Go back further and they
spent four years claiming the 2016 election was rigged and then
committed massive election fraud in the 2020 election.

This is how you can discern the future in regime rhetoric. Regime-ology,
like Kremlinology in the Cold War, is becoming a skill in this age. You
read the regime organs like the Washington Post or New York Times not
for the literal content, but for the esoteric content, the stuff between
the lines. In order to be prepared for what they will do next, we have
all been forced to be Straussian. Of course, we also have the opposite
rule of liberalism to guide us.

This is why the stories about a potential military coup are interesting.
This [one](https://archive.is/P59Zi) from December got the ball rolling.
It is framed as a warning of a possible coup by the imaginary army of
insurrectionists, but clearly the authors are imagining themselves as a
triumvirate saving “our” democracy. A couple of weeks later, the
Pentagon
[assured](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/12/30/the-pentagon-has-streamlined-the-process-for-sending-national-guard-troops-into-dc/)
us that they are ready to send troops into Washington and seize control
of the government if people vote the wrong way in the next election.

You do not have to be a geezer to recall a time when such talk was
strictly forbidden by the mass media and political class. In fact, they
went out of their way to assure themselves and the public that no one in
the army would ever think of such a thing, much less suggest it. You
see, America was a republic with civilian control of the military, so
such a thing was impossible. It was often implied that the greatness of
the military was the result of its republican virtue.

It used to be that the far-left would have been berserk with anger over
the suggestion that the military would be needed to secure “our”
democracy. They hated the military and saw it as the enemy of democracy.
An indication of just how much the Left has changed over the last decade
or so is their [reaction](https://archive.ph/pZNnm) to that column. They
[think](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/31/1068930675/us-election-coup-january-6-military-constitution)
it is wonderful that the military is publicly expressing their loyalty
to “our” democracy and promising to crush the alleged enemies of it.

It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at these ridiculous sissies
in regime media cheering for a military coup. One of the interesting
features of the managerial class is their assumption that the
institutions exist to serve their interests. They never think for a
second that the men with guns defending “our” democracy may realize they
no longer need the managerial class to run the administrative state.
Meetings are for men in suits, not for men in charge holding guns.

Putting that aside, this coup talk offers some insight into what the
people in charge are plotting for the near future. The upcoming midterm
election is of little interest as it just means the Republicans gain
some seats. The focus is on the 2024 election, which they now view as
the great battle between “our” democracy and the imaginary
insurrectionists, otherwise known as Trump voters. They have no
intention of allowing Trump to win and take office again.

This strikes normal people as a bit strange. After all, what was plain
in the Trump years is he is no threat to the regime. If he returned to
office, he is not going exact revenge on those who wronged him. He will
crawl on his belly for their approval. The regime, on the other hand,
cannot see this. They always project their own qualities onto their
enemies and in this case, they assume Trump would seek murderous
revenge. After all, that is what they would do if they were him. They
will not allow it.

This offers another insight into regime thinking. They assume Trump
would act like they would act if in the same position. That means they
assume he will have them jailed and tossed into dungeons on made up
charges. They see this as a threat to “our” democracy, which then
justifies any means necessary to stop it. This is how the 2020 election
was fueled by widescale fraud. They told their election volunteers that
any means necessary was acceptable.

Looking ahead, what this suggests is that a military coup of some sort
is in the cards within the next decade. Since the generals are all
super-woke, it probably means something like a hybrid civilian-military
junta. The leaders of the Democratic party will lock arms with the
military leadership to “defend our democracy” by overturning the
elections and imposing a form of martial law. Some Republicans will be
arrested as conspirators and insurrectionists.

There is another thing evident in these posts that offers some insight
into what will happen in the near term. These super-woke generals are
just as delusional as the super-woke regime leaders. Would the rank and
file in the armed services support a scheme to “defend our democracy”
from Boomers waving flags? The most likely result would be a schism in
the services. Instead of being a show of strength, a coup would turn
into another display of weakness and incoherence.

Another iron law of the universe is that managerial regimes become
decreasingly competent over time. This was what brought down communism.
The Soviet system was so corrupt it was no longer functional in the end.
That is the most likely end for the regime’s coup plans. The will is
there but the system has simply become too incompetent and corrupt to do
it. There will be tanks in the streets, but they will be broken down and
abandoned like the regime itself.
