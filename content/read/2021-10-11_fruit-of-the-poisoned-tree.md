**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/living-in-the-age-of-jim-snow/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki column</a> is up. The topic this
week is the increasingly familiar and obvious Jim Snow laws of America.
Behind the green door we have the weekly Sunday
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/440949" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">podcast</a> where I rant and rave about the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In every form of human organization there are layers of responsibility.
The simplest way of expressing it is that at the top there is always the
boss who is the guy making the important decisions for the organization.
Everyone else, in one fashion or another, takes orders from the boss and
carries out the orders.  Always at the bottom are people who just do
what they are told. The vertical arrangements are one of the truths of
work life that everyone just accepts without much thought.

More formally, at the top layer of an organization, like a business, are
the big decision makers for the organization. Below them are the policy
makers. They take the big initiative and turn it into rules and plans.
Below them are the people who make those rules and plans into reality.
This is the layer most people inside and outside the organization see.
They instruct the bottom layer of the organization, train them and
making sure they follow through on their orders.

The important part of this arrangement is that everyone in the
organization understands their role within the organization. The private
in a rifle platoon has to understand that his role is to follow the
orders given him by is squad leader or platoon leader. His job is not to
determine strategy or decide on objectives. Similarly, the guy on the
shop floor has to know his duty is to perform the role he is assigned at
a workstation. Otherwise, the organization breaks down and fails to
operate as intended.

At the bottom this is rarely a problem, as the people at the bottom are
well aware of their status in the hierarchy. The people at the top, of
course, know they are at the top of the hierarchy and what that means.
The trouble comes in the middle layers where the people tend to be the
most ambitious and most prone to overstepping their bounds, hoping to
impress the boss. They can also be overly cautious, fearful of getting
blamed for doing something wrong and losing status in the organization.

This is where the culture of the organization plays a decisive role. A
company with a good corporate culture will have a management layer full
of people who not only know their roles but embrace them in the context
of the larger organization. A good military culture is one where the
officers respect the chain of command, but also understand mission
priorities and the need to improvise when necessary. Good organizational
culture is what makes or breaks an organization.

This is also where we see the inherent problem of democracy. The basic
premise of democratic systems is one man one vote. That means every vote
is equal, which is another way of saying that every opinion is equally
valid. In the political sense, it means the opinion of the bum counts
the same as the opinion of the businessman who volunteers at the church
on weekends. The bum’s vote counts for the same as the vote of the man
committed to his community.

Democracy flies in the face of everything we know about human
organization, because it rejects the natural hierarchy we see
everywhere. Worse yet, it gnaws away at the basic understanding of human
relations. Those middle-managers in a well-run company are happy to be
in their roles. They may have ambition, but they also accept reality and
know that their ambitions are linked to that reality. The morality of
democracy undermines the very basis of their relationship to the whole.

This is why modern democracies are full of people confused about their
place in society as well as the role others play. There is a whole genre
of videos on-line where people confront store managers about things no
reasonable person should expect them to know or control. We have the
opposite, as well, where people at the lowest ranks of management carry
on like they are shot callers, pushing people around and going well
beyond the limits of their role.

Imagine a factory where everyone thinks they should have a say in what
the factory makes and how much they make of it. The guy who cleans the
workstations gets the same vote as the sales manager and the plant
manager. Imagine a platoon where the men vote on their missions and
collectively decide on their targets. It sounds like madness because it
is madness. That factory would go out of business in a hurry and that
military unit would quickly become a criminal gang.

This is, however, how the West has decided to run their societies. Now,
it is true that the real shot callers hide in the shadows, using the
institutions to manipulate public opinion and coerce people into their
positions. They do so, however, while promoting the idea that everyone’s
opinion is the same and every opinion counts. On the one hand they
promote chaos, while on the other they try to maintain order. It is no
wonder that the liberal democracies are shaking themselves to pieces.

The temptation is to blame the internet for allowing the stupid to have
easy access to the public square, but in reality, the internet is just a
facilitator. According to the tenets of democracy, Twitter is the goal,
not a terrible accident. Imagine the town square full of howling
lunatics and you get the prefect image of democracy. Social media made
real is a public riot but is also exactly what you get when everyone
stops accepting their role in the hierarchy and thinks they are a king.

Fundamentally, all forms of democracy are as hostile and contrary to the
nature of man as all forms of communism. Both communism and democracy
assume something about people that can never be true. That is, all men
are equal. This is obviously false in the simplest organization and even
more so in the most complex. Just as communism has always ended in
disaster, democracy has always ended in murder. Both delusions are the
fruit of the same poison tree named equality.
