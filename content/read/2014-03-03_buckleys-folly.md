I still subscribe to National Review and I still visit the site daily.
It is more habit than interest these days. The magazine goes unread
until they pile up and I thumb through them in one sitting. Charles
Cooke is interesting from time to time. Andrew Stuttaford is often good
when he writes about Europe. Kevin Williamson is the best writer they
have left, which speaks to how bad it is now. They have run off most
anyone with talent and something interesting to say.

Anyway, <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/372282/power-hidden-law-jonah-goldberg"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I was trying to read this from
Jonah Goldberg</a> and I kept thinking about how dreary National Review
is these days. Part of it is me. My views have changed as I have grown
older. It is just a part of getting older. But, the world has changed
too. In the 1980’s, Bill Buckley was a rock star, of sorts. The main
reason is a new generation was ready to push back against the Baby
Boomer liberals. To be a young right-winger in the 1980’s was a lot of
fun, even if the ideology did not always make sense.

Today that brand of conservatism feels about as exciting as disco.
Reading Jonah’s column, I was thinking about how many times I’ve heard
the same argument from the Conventional Right. There’s nothing wrong
with it, other than the fact it was a reasonable response to the Left in
1950. Given where we are as a culture, the value of gentling tapping the
brakes on the Progressive drive to the abyss is lost on me. I mean,
what’s the point?  The time for debating this stuff is long ago in a
foreign country.

For some reason I was reminded of when John O. Sullivan was shown the
door by Bill Buckley. I had vague recollections of it being another case
where Buckley canned the guy most thought was set to take over for him.
I went looking and
<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/osullivan-on-brookhiser-and-buckley"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is the best I could
find</a>, which is a column with lots of quotes from the article I must
be recalling. Buckley could never figure out how to close the show that
was his life. Like all men, he struggled to turn control of his project
over to someone competent.

Given the shabby state of the conservative movement Buckley built and
the sorry state of his signature achievement, he was foolish to try and
leave a legacy. It is ironic in a way as he saw what happened to Henry
Luce and his magazine empire after his demise. He was friends with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Olin_Foundation"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John M. Olin</a>, who
bankrolled a lot of early conservative enterprises. Buckley surely knew
that the best course was to shut it all down and let the next man build
his own thing, outside the shadow of Buckley and his project.

Maybe it will not matter much. There does seem to be a gathering storm
of dissident writers and publications out there on the Internet. Taki
Mag has become a must read among anti-liberals. Bloggers like Steve
Sailer promote dissident ideas. Still, it would be better if there was
not this hollowed out entity claiming to represent the opposition to the
Progressive orthodoxy. In the end, Buckley’s vanity may end up causing
more harm to the causes he championed than the good he did as a leader
of the Right.
