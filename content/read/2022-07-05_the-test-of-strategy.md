In sports, the final test is the game or the match in which the two
sides compete with one side coming out victorious. All the practice and
preparation are finally tested on the field against a real opponent.
Similarly, war is the final test between nations competing with one
another on the world stage. All the theory and strategy that each side
was sure would work is put to the test.

This is what we are seeing in the Ukraine. Since 2014, NATO counties
have been arming and equipping the Ukrainian army for a war with Russia.
For about the same time, the Russians have been thinking about war with
the West. Preparation for fighting Ukraine started only a few years ago,
but it has been clear to Russian leaders that conflict with the West was
coming at some point.

Getting back to the sports analogy, NATO, which is America for all
practical purposes, has been the reigning champion. Since the Cold War
it has been assumed that no military could challenge the US military.
The combination of technology, experience and economic resources made it
possible for American to take the fight to any place on the planet and
fight in the enemy’s backyard.

That last bit is an important part of the formula. If you have to fight
a war on your home territory, winning comes with a fair bit of losing.
Even before industrial war, defending your own lands meant disruption to
your economy and culture. Fighting on the other guy’s turf is always
preferred. Winning is all upside and you can mitigate the cost of losing
by withdrawing before total defeat.

This was the formula for destroying Russia. The West, which again is the
Global American Empire, would wage a proxy war on the borders of Russia.
This would force the Russians to exhaust themselves defending the
border. Eventually, the war would move onto Russian territory. Of
course, economic war in this age is presumed to be one way to bring the
war home to the civilian population.

From the very start, the collective West has operated under the
assumption that the Russians could not sustain combat activity in the
Ukraine for long. According to all the analysis, the Russians lacked the
manpower, the money and the supplies to fight for more than a few
months. Many analysts claimed that the war would last but a few weeks
before the Russians ran out of material to fight.

Here we are five months into the war and that last bit of analysis has
proved to be completely wrong. A <a
href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/return-industrial-warfare"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> by the Royal United Services
Institute, a venerable British institution, finds that the Russians have
more than enough industrial capacity to maintain this war for as long as
it takes. In fact, the evidence suggests that they have much more
capacity than is currently being used.

Last weekend, the Russian army along with militia forces took control of
the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region of
the Donbas. This ensures the quick end to the Ukrainian occupation of
that region. There will be some cleaning up before the final push to
destroy the rest of the Ukrainian army currently hunkered down in the
towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.

Getting back to the sports analogy, the much smaller force taking the
fight to the larger force in this war is like the smaller man going on
the offensive against the bigger champion in a boxing match. The Russian
expeditionary force is less that two hundred thousand men, while the
Ukrainian army is half a million. Then there is the fact that the
Ukrainians were armed and trained by the collective West.

There is a lot to be said about the technical aspects of the war and how
the Russians have been able to defeat the Ukrainians. There is no
question that the Russians, after some early missteps, have been better
tactically than the West. The Ukrainians have been doing what American
commanders have instructed, but the Russians seem to have done their
homework and anticipated these moves.

All of the particulars are interesting on their own and will get
analyzed in due time, but the larger issue is what matters now. The West
went into this fight, in fact they precipitated the fight, sure that
their strategy was superior. The war in Ukraine was going to be the
proof of concept. The forces of democracy, trained by the heroes of
democracy, would triumph over the opponents of democracy.

Right now, the going is slow for the Russians due to the fact they are
meticulously removing an army from industrial areas in large population
zones. In the next month, the battle will move to the open country where
Russians air power and mobile units will come into their own. Instead of
artillery battles, it will be one army demolishing the remnant of
another army in the open field.

In other words, to get back to the sports analogy, we are about to enter
the part of the fight where it is clear the champion is in serious
trouble. This is when the announcers say something about how the
champion was not prepared for the fight or that the opponent came in
with a better strategy. Barring some miracle, the underrated challenger
is going to score a huge upset over the champion.

This is not a boxing match. What the summer and autumn will bring is a
flood of refugees from Ukraine into the West. The Germans are already
facing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_Winter" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Turnip Winter</a> thanks to energy shortages. The Poles
are running out of money and patience with regards to the refugee
situation. The collective West is facing a severe economic crisis as a
result of the war against Russia.

Getting back to where we started, this war is the great test of the New
World Order that Western elites have been boasting about at swanky
conferences. It is not about Ukraine, but about the new way of running
society. This was supposed to be the great leap forward into
international managerialism, rule by the global best. Instead, it is
looking like a global disaster caused by the West.

In sports, coaches, trainers and strategists whose teams and athletes
fail in competition get fired from their jobs. It remains to be seen
whether the people behind this debacle will get fired. History says they
will learn nothing from this debacle. Like the restored Bourbons,
Western elites forget nothing and learn nothing. On the other hand, if
things get bad enough, they may not have a choice in the matter.
