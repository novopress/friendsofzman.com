In the biological sciences, there are a group of measures used to test
the health of an ecosystem or the health of a species. In the case of a
species, estimates of the population are usually the starting place.
Then it may be the population density of the species, which can
determine if the pressure is the loss of habitat or some unknown
environmental factor that is lowering fertility. It is assumed that a
declining population relative to territory is always a sign of crisis in
a species.

Of course, these measures are never used to test the health of European
populations because that is a conspiracy theory. Everyone knows that all
you have to do is utter the abracadabra phrase “conspiracy theory” and
all of the related things that are easily observed can no longer be
mentioned. Putting that aside, the same measures we use to test the
health of a species could be applied to humans. In fact, we could have
much more granular and accurate measures.

For example, we cannot know the total fertility rate of a frog species,
but we do know the fertility rate of humans. In fact, we could break it
down by race and ethnicity if we really wanted to know the answer. We
know that the population of European people, relative to other
populations has declined significantly over the last century. We also
know the population density of Europeans in Western lands, relative to
other races has also declined significantly over the last century.

Unlike frogs or bats, humans have quantifiable social habits that are
tied to the health and wellbeing of the people. Church attendance in the
West, for example, correlates with fertility rates. Across the West,
church attendance has been in decline and along with it the overall
fertility rate. In parts of Europe, churches are now museums used at
Christmas and Easter for largely secular ceremonies. In the United
States, the ruling classes mocks and ridicules Christians.

This overall drop in church attendance tracks with the growing social
unrest and the alarming decline is social trust. Put another way, a
healthy society can have a good government or a bad government, but it
can thrive because it has an abundance of social capital as measured by
trust its primary social institution. On the other hand, a society in
crisis has declining social capital. Trust in the organic institutions
like the church, declines, reflecting the collapse in social trust.

There is a lot here, but the one thing we can know for certain is that
Christianity in the West is in crisis. That crisis seems to parallel the
crisis facing European people, which suggests there is a connection.
Maybe the decline in faith is a symptom of the overall decline in the
people or maybe all of these measures have a common cause that lies
upstream from the culture. The “who decides’ answer is controlling the
“how things are decided” side of the formula.
