The podcast I did on the Dissident Right turned out to be a hit, so I
have decided to make the single topic format a regular feature. This
being a holiday week and a very slow news week, it makes sense to take
another swing at the single topic format. Doing something like this, it
is important to keep an eye on what works for you. My style,
disposition, tone of voice and so forth will work better with some
things and not so good on others.

One of things about doing a single topic show is it forces me to think a
little deeper about the topic. This week, for example, I found myself a
little stumped on defining white identity politics. Doing some research,
I did not find a lot of easy answers either. I did the best I could for
this show, but I will be revisiting the topic in the future. For that
alone, I’m enjoying the single topic concept. If there is no struggle,
there is no progress.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
