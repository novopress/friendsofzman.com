Last weekend, Richard Spencer tried to hold his annual conference. The
vehicle Spencer uses to run his alt-right thing is the <a

a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit based in Montana. This is a standard thing to
do these days, for any sort of activism. It allows rich people to
quietly fund activities and take a tax deduction for it. It also gives
solo acts a way to fund their activities, without having to keep a day
job. Once a year, Spencer has a conference and dinner for the people
interested in his efforts.

Last year was the infamous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Heil-gate episode</a>, where Spencer’s imprudence got
himself in trouble. Since then, Progressives have been working hard to
un-person him and anything he touches. That linked video has 2.8 million
views for a reason. As a result, he was unable to book the Reagan
Building for his event, which is a violation of Federal law, but the
people in charge think the law is for suckers. They do what they want.
As a result, <a

If you go to the source article, the picture of Spencer they use is from
his thing at the University of Florida. OK. Stock photos are standard
stuff in the news business. Then they use a picture of a black protester
from that Florida event. That has no place in a story about something
entirely different and 3,000 miles to the north. It is an important
lesson that no one on our side can seem to get through their thick
skulls. The people in charge are perfectly willing to lie, cheat and
steal to win. They are not bound by any rules.

Putting that aside, the highlighted portion of the story is
illustrative. This is the sort of the stuff Gentry Conservatives wave
around claiming they have their principles, while the winning side is
riddled with hypocrisy. The winning side, however, just shrugs, because
as far as they are concerned, that quote is the model of logic. That is
the nature of cults and the people inside them. The rules and tactics of
the cult are the model of moral perfection and timeless logic. You not
getting this is proof that the adherents are anointed.

Cults have an internal language that only the members fully understand.
The zombie who issued that statement knows that “family values” means
*the cult’s definition of family values*. By “people of all backgrounds”
they just assume it excludes people outside the cult. The people outside
the walls are not really people. They do not exist as a flesh and blood
humans. It is the same reason the Puritans had no trouble burning
Indians and chasing Anglicans off into the wilderness. They did not see
them as human.

I will also note that the Washington Post story is not an actual news
story. [The Five W’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) could have
been done in a paragraph, which by the conventions of news reporting
make it not worth doing. It was a non-event. That is why the bulk of the
story is folklore and legend now popular with the cult. There is the
Charlottesville reference, the preening and pleading of the fearful
restaurant owners and so on. This is written as a cautionary tale for
other cult members. “Beware! If you are not vigilant, the Nazis will
show up at your door!”

It is why it is useless to bother engaging with these people at any
level. It is better to imagine them as a colonizing tribe of aliens.
There is no middle ground, no room for agreement, because their reason
to exists, their core identity, is based on wiping out all
non-believers. Anything that even hints at compromise, is seen by the
cult as a direct threat to its very existence. That is why they take so
much pleasure in stalking guys like Spencer around and preventing him
from living a normal life. It is what defines them.
