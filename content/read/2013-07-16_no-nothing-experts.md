When future generations are picking through the rubble of our
civilization, [they will wonder about stuff like
this](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/353404/21st-century-glass-steagall-act-james-pethokoukis).
National Review was a serious publication for intelligent ruling class
people. Reagan was a regular reader and credited the publication with
informing his views on a range of issues. Bill Buckley was a genius and
a polymath. James Pethokoukis is supposed to be their economics guy, yet
he displays a staggering ignorance of the subject, often just repeating
what the jabbering numskulls on CNBC say every night.

This column is just bad reporting, but [he often
opines](http://www.aei-ideas.org/channel/pethokoukis/) on economics in a
way that suggests he could not run a lemonade stand. Dig a little into
his bio and you learn that he was a journalism major in college. He has
never held a job in business or finance. His adult life has been
occupied with writing about a subject he knows nothing. He may be a
bright guy and a quick study, but without training or experience, he is
wholly unqualified to comment about these subjects. Yet, here he is
casting himself as an expert.

This is something you see throughout the media. On television it is a
parade of feckless airheads reading from a teleprompter. [This now
legendary
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=L1JYHNX8pdo)
shows that these idiots will read anything that is put in front of them.
Their guests are not much better. They are almost always washouts from
some industry who canâ€™t get jobs. Otherwise, they are people better at
talking about their field than doing it. There are more retired generals
on TV payrolls than on active duty in the military.

The hippies had one thing right. Getting wasted and listening to Led
Zeppellin all day is not a great way to spend your life, but dropping
out has a lot of merit.
