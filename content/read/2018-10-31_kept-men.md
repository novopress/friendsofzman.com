In
<a href="https://twitter.com/EmeraldRobinson/status/1057364269124251648"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">a series of tweets yesterday</a>, someone
calling herself Emerald Robinson announced she had evidence that at
least one “conservative” magazine was taking payola from a tech giant.
The implication was that the magazine was taking money in exchange for
countering the stories about the tech oligarchs censoring dissidents.The
woman works for an outfit called <a

operation that has made a name for itself during the Trump phenomenon.
Here are the tweets in case they vanish.

The most likely candidate, before examining the hints in the tweet, is
National Review, which lost its moral compass when Rich Lowry took over
the operation. It is also the one conservative publication with any
influence, at least before it hurled itself onto the Never Trump bonfire
three years ago. If you are going to bribe a conservative publication,
you may as well bribe the biggest one. It is not like any of these
operations are making so much money that they would say not to a bribe.
It’s their reason to exist.

Of course, the clue about the subscriber base evaporating adds to the
speculation that the culprit is National Review. When you look at the
[tax
filings](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/133/133649537/133649537_201707_990.pdf)
for the 501(c)(3) they use to launder contributions, it appears their
donations shriveled up during the campaign. Their ugly smear campaign
against Trump and his voters turns out to have been a costly blunder.
That is if the tax filings tell the whole story. It is possible that the
tech giant or some other wealthy patron is paying writers directly or
using another vehicle.

I speculated during the campaign that Dan and Farris Wilks were buying
support for Ted Cruz and funding the Never Trump lunacy among so-called
conservatives. The two are members in good standing of the donor class
and the guys bankrolling people like Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, and
Glenn Beck. My suspicion was they were spreading cash around on the side
to the various pens for hire at operations like National Review and the
Federalist. It would explain some rather obvious patterns we saw in the
campaign.

Now, in fairness to National Review, we do not know if the person
tweeting this stuff is legitimate or correct. Her name suggests she
should be swinging from a pole, rather than covering the White House,
but these days, the differences between the two professions are
microscopic. In fact, it would be a relief to learn that the mass media
is simply singing for their supper, delivering what a handful of
billionaires demand. Otherwise, it suggests a systemic failure that can
only be addressed by madame guillotine.

Still, even if the rumor is just that, it raises an important point. The
media in America has never been objective or bound by a code of conduct.
Into the twentieth century, everyone understood that the newspapers were
owned by rich guys with an agenda. There were newspapers for the parties
and for the factions within each party. What happened in the Cold War is
that the bias was concealed to fool the public into supporting the
struggle against the Soviets. Suddenly, reporters became journalists and
priests.

When you dig through the tax forms of the various not-for profit
operations used by Conservative Inc., you find that their stars are
living lifestyles that would make the people who read them faint. Jonah
Goldberg is a great example. He gets 200 large from the National Review
Institute. He gets a similar figure from American Enterprise. Then he
has a cable deal from Fox. He writes books that no one reads, but the
not-for-profit system buys these books in bulk. Add it all up and he
lives like royalty for doing very little.

Of course, this explains why the so-called conservative opposition is
unwilling to oppose or conserve anything. They are afraid to bite the
hand that feeds them. To wander off the reservation and possibly anger
their pay masters, means leaving a life of extreme luxury for, at best,
a middle-class life. It is not as if a Jonah Goldberg could replicate
his earnings in the dreaded private sector. The life of a kept man is
one of trepidation. They live in fear that the fads will change, they
will be deemed heretical and ejected from the hive.

At the human level it is somewhat understandable, but when you look at
the whole, it means the whole system is a massive scam design to fool
the public. Just as campaign finance laws are designed to obscure who is
bribing your politicians, the labyrinth of 501(3)(c) operations that
finance the commentariat are designed to conceal who is controlling
public opinion. Even if we never get the full story about which
publication was taking the bribes, the truth of it is slowly bleeding
into public consciousness.

In the meantime, the kept men glance furtively at social media,
wondering if it will be their publication that gets outed or if maybe
their name will turn up in the story. Maybe some are [reaching out to
their friends at other media
operations](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/03/joshn-trevino-admits-to-shilling-for-malaysia.html),
just in case they need to find a new landing spot. It is the whore’s
life they chose, so no one should feel pity for them. In fact, these
people deserve nothing but scorn. They choose to play an active role in
the decay of our society, by undermining social trust. They deserve what
is coming to them.
