Libertarians have everything about human nature exactly backwards.
Humans are not rational actors and we should never want to be. The other
thing about libertarians is they suffer from many of the same defects as
liberals. Chief among them is their moral preening. There’s no better
example than Nick Gillespie from Reason. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I read this</a> and think he
must be an awful person to be around or have as a neighbor.

*As one of the folks (along with Matt Welch, natch), who started the
whole [“Libertarian Moment” meme way back in
2008,](http://reason.com/archives/2008/11/25/the-libertarian-moment) it’s
been interesting to see all the ways in which folks on the right and
left get into such a lather at the very notion of expanding freedom and
choice in many (though sadly not all) aspects of human activity.*

*Indeed, the brain freeze can get so intense that it turns occasionally
smart people into mental defectives.*

No one gets into a lather of expanding freedom and choice. That’s just
signaling so the reader knows he is in the presence of the anointed. The
fact is, hardly anyone pays much attention to libertarians. The reason
is life is not a math problem nor is it an economic problem. Public
debate is about what kind of society we wish to have and that means
culture.

*To wit, [Damon Linker’s recent
essay](http://theweek.com/article/index/268820/libertarianisms-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-idea)
in The Week (a great magazine, by the way), which argues that the
outcomes of U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Libya disprove
libertarianism, in particular, the Hayekian principle of “spontaneous
order.”*

*No shit. Linker is being super-cereal here, kids.*

Nick is a 50-year old man. There’s simply no reason to write like a
teenager. Putting that aside, the observable reality of the Middle East
is, in fact, a perfect case against libertarianism. Remove a central
authority with the willingness and ability to enforce the rules and you
get Lord of the Flies with camels and swarthy guys firing Kalashnikovs.
The same is true of Africa and South America. It turns out that the only
people capable of pulling off anything close to libertarianism are
Anglo-Saxons.

But, that’s noticing and that leads to the great bogeyman that haunts
the dreams of the libertarian weirdo – culture. Africans prefer a form
of government that is based on neopatrimonialism. South Americans have
always preferred autocratic rule, often by military men. Russians love
their czars. Economic systems spring from culture. Culture and genetics
dance the dance within the bounds of their geography to make the people
we around the world. No words on a sheet of paper will change that
natural realty.
