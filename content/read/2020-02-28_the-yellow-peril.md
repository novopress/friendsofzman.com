Most of you are probably listening to this week’s show while laying-in
stocks of emergency foodstuffs and ammunition, in preparation for the
riots that will surely come from the Chinese Flu. Make sure to have a
thirty day supply of water, as you cannot go more than a few days
without drinking water. If the media is right and this plague is
retribution from the gods for voting Trump into office, the suffering
will surely last more than a few days. Welcome to the end times.

In all seriousness, this flu is a serious matter, but the most likely
result is something far short of the promised apocalypse. The Spanish
Flu, which hit during the Great War, did not end the human race or put
much of a dent in it. This virus is not that and we are better prepared
for it than a century ago. The most likely result of this pandemic is a
mild recession and a discrediting of the globalist project. Open borders
and outsourcing to China is looking a lot less wonderful all of a
sudden.

That will be the interesting thing to watch over the next months as this
virus becomes a part of daily life. So far, the Democrat candidates have
yet to figure out how to talk about, other than the puerile whining
about “Orange Man Bad” stuff. Trump seems to be figuring out that this
is offering him an issue, but he has yet to seize on it. He hinted at it
in his presser, when he said his decision to shutter travel from China
may have prevented the rapid spread of the virus to America.

Some politicians have started to figure out that this thing can be a
club to assault the China lobby in Washington. Josh Hawley has a bill to
redirect the production of medical supplies from China back to the
United States. A general re-thinking of reliance on China for
manufactured goods is probably the first result of this plague. Someone
will eventually link the free movement of people over the southern
border to the free movement of disease over the southern border.

The thing to watch, I think, is what happens when it becomes clear to
everyone that the disease is the product of Chinese corruption. There’s
pretty good evidence now that the virus originated in the lab. Most
likely they were doing perfectly legitimate research on these viruses,
but the endemic corruption of China and their sloppy controls led to
this virus getting loose on the public. Throw in other issues like
[fentanyl](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/02/26/stanford-student-died-from-accidental-fentanyl-overdose-coroner-confirms),
[espionage](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-02-25/calpers-ben-meng-targeted-china-fears)
and
[corruption](https://abcnews.go.com/International/fbi-arrests-chinese-millionaire-tied-clinton-scandal/story?id=33990683)
and China should quickly become a pariah.

This pandemic is probably going to be what the rage head Nicholas Taleb
called a black swan event. There will be what passed for conventional
wisdom before the event and what passes for it after the event. In the
before times, there was a general consensus that China was largely a
benign force in the world. After the pandemic, China will be viewed as a
threat to global order. We have probably just seen the end of peak China
and the world enters the phase of post-China.

On the other hand, one should not underestimate the stupidity and
perfidy of the ruling classes in the West. An alien greed-head like Mike
Bloomberg, for example, does not care how many Americans die in order to
keep doing business with China. Those are not his people. The actors
hired by the plutocrats to be our politicians could very well keep
reading from the same pro-China script. In this regard, the Yellow Peril
could prove to be a clarifying event for many Americans.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.
