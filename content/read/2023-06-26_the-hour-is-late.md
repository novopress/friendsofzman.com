Corruption is a natural part of government, regardless of the type of
government, because men are not angels. Government has the power to
compel which means it will always attract the sorts of people who are
comfortable using force to take the property of others. In this regard,
government corruption is a measure of the tolerance of corruption in the
system. Government corruption is a function of the culture that controls
the actions of the people in government.

By way of example, think about cheating in sports. Baseball developed a
steroid problem because the culture within the sport came to tolerate
it. No player dared report another player as it would lower his status
in the sport. Once the league instituted tough drug testing measures,
the culture changed. Players caught cheating let down their teams and
even cost teammates money. This lowered their status so the culture of
tolerance flipped to a culture of intolerance.

Police departments have always struggled with the culture of corruption.
In the last century, big city police departments would go from clean to
dirty almost overnight due to the actions of a few crooked cops. The
crooked cops would find ways to get other cops to take bribes or
participate in shakedowns. This made all the cops guilty to some degree,
even if they just remained silent. An otherwise honest precinct quickly
became corrupt because the culture changed.

Police corruption is useful in understanding government corruption.
Police departments have a high degree of group loyalty. Fraternity is
promoted and reinforced in many ways, thus discouraging cops from
reporting corruption. No one wants to be seen as a rat, so the natural
tendency is to ignore bad behavior by fellow cops. Corrupt cops easily
turn this virtue into a vice, by using this high group loyalty as a way
to pressure their fellow cops into ignoring their corruption.

When you look at corrupt police precincts, the pattern repeats. The
dirty cops start small, often roping in fellow cops on small things like
stealing money from the people they arrest. The victims are not only
outsiders, but viewed as the bad guys, so no one is running to the boss
to report it. At some point, a critical mass of cops is doing this stuff
and the culture changes. The “cool guys” are the ones shaking down drug
dealers, while the “squares” look the other way.

We may be seeing the same process in Washington. The credible charges
against the Biden family are piling up, but so far, few are speaking out
about it. Fringe bomb throwers like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren
Boebert are making noises about it, but people with status have been
slow to say anything. Chuck Grassley is the most soberminded person to
raise the issue, but he was mostly ignored by his fellow senators when
he raised the issue last month.

What we know so far is that while Joe Biden was Vice President, he
extorted the government of Ukraine. We know this because he used to brag
about threatening them into firing the prosecutor looking into
corruption. We now know that the Ukrainian prosecutor was looking into
Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, which was making deals with
prominent Washington people. Hunter Biden was given a no-show job at the
company, so we know what was happening here.

We also know that Hunter Biden shook down a Chinese company via text
message, using Joe Biden as a threat. We also know the Chinese company
gave money to Hunter Biden immediately after the threatening text
message. In any other context this is a simple case of extortion. In the
political context it is influence peddling. When this is added to the
millions of dollars in mystery payments received by members of the Biden
family, it suggests a long-term pattern of corruption.

Again, this sort of thing is to be expected. What matters here is the
weird cone of silence around this story. Regime media mentions it in
passing, often shaping these revelations as partisan bickering. Senior
Republicans are trying hard to ignore the whole thing. One reason for
this wall of silence is that this sort of corruption is so common that
no one knows who is clean and who is dirty. Like the corrupt police
precinct, the culture of corruption breeds a culture of silence.

The Hunter Biden stuff strongly suggests that this is not an isolated
thing. Everyone in Washington knew that Hunter Biden was a crackhead.
The only reason anyone would do business with him was to gain favors
from his father. Everyone in Washington knows how things work, so no one
can claim ignorance. It is a small town and everyone knows what everyone
is doing. They may not have the nitty-gritty details, but they know the
general outlines. There are few secrets in Washington.

The other thing that points to a widespread culture of corruption is the
outlandish nature of the crimes. Biden bragging about threatening the
Ukrainians never raised any alarms in Washington, because it was the new
normal. Hunter getting a no-show job at a foreign company raised no
eyebrows because everyone was doing it. Hunter being a crackhead doing
deals with foreign companies should have raised alarms, but official
Washington looked the other way.

This raises the question as to why we are hearing stories about Biden
corruption from various whistleblowers and anonymous leakers.
Speculation is that it is a way to ease Biden out of the way without a
messy primary. That is possible, given his failing mental condition, but
there is another reason. Based on his recent public appearances it is
clear that he is fading quickly. It is possible he drops dead soon and
that would mean putting the moronic Kamala Harris in charge.

Another answer is that no one cares. Things have reached the point in
Washington where everyone shrugs at this stuff. Like the corrupt police
precinct, morality has been turned on its head. Those not involved in
shakedowns and influence peddling are viewed as fools, while the smash
and grab people are high status. This behavior is now a form of ingroup
signaling. Your willingness to take money and your creativity in doing
it is what elevates your status in Washington.

None of this bodes well for the civic nationalist types. A system that
presents the voters with a choice between two men in ski masks is not
going to result in one of them turning on the other. What this all
points to is that we are in the final phase of what Sir John Glubb
[described](http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf) in *The Fate of
Empires*. The American empire has entered the final phase where looting
is the norm and decline is embraced. Everyone is grabbing what they can
before the music stops and the party ends.
