A good way to get yourself sent off to the reeducation camp is to point
out the dysfunction in black America. The only acceptable opinion is
that blacks are the victims of white racism. No matter the topic, if it
includes black people the answer is racism, even for blacks talking
about the topic. There’s some truth to it, but the reason for that is
the insane rule itself. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story</a> about the mayor
of New York City is a good example.

*A senior adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio is in a serious relationship
with a convicted killer and interstate drug trafficker whose most recent
run-in with the law happened late last year — when he nearly ran over a
New Jersey police officer while driving her car, records show.*

*Rachel Noerdlinger, the chief of staff to first lady Chirlane McCray
who has attended top-level NYPD meetings, has been romantically linked
to Hassaun McFarlan since 2010. Court and police records show that the
two have lived together for nearly two years.*

*McFarlan, 36, has been arrested at least five times, including for the
fatal shooting of a teenager over a down jacket, records show.*

*Two of the arrests occurred while he was dating Noerdlinger, a former
aide to the Rev. Al Sharpton. While they’ve been an item, McFarlan has
also trashed police officers on his Facebook account, referring to them
as “pigs” in two posts.*

*In one online rant, McFarlan said, “I cant come outside without the
pigs f—— with me in the hood.”*

Most black people, especially black women, are law abiding, peaceable
people who just want to live their lives. Rachel Noerdlinger is
obviously a bright and hard working women. If she were your co-worker or
neighbor, you would probably like her. The trouble comes when the
violent, out of control boyfriend arrives. They almost always arrive.
That’s the problem and it is a problem for the majority of black people.
They are forever terrorized by this subset of the black community.

Whites are good at dealing with their trouble makers. Violent and lazy
whites are shunned by respectable whites. Even in the lower classes, the
criminal element is segregated from the rest. Blacks don’t do this and
it harms all black people. Rachel Noerdlinger will most likely get
fired. She will pay the price for her criminally violent boyfriend.

This is why segregation is still common. A black family moves in and the
whites are thrilled to be diverse. Then the ghetto friends of the black
family show up one night and party until four in the morning. The next
week all of those white people with their “coexist” bumper stickers are
calling the Realtor. The rush to get out is on and the original black
family finds themselves living in the old neighborhood again, just in a
different location.
