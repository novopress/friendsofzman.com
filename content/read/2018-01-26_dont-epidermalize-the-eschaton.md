I have a fancy new graphic for these posts. I hated the way my posts
look on Gab, so I’ve been fiddling around with Adobe to create some
graphics that look decent on social media, but don’t clutter up the
site. I’m a minimalist, as should be obvious. I think too much is too
much. My friends tell me I should have been Amish. I don’t disagree.
Even so, a good blog should feature good content, not endless scripts
and overly produced graphics. Blogs are for reading.

Anyway, a couple of administrative notes. I will be traveling next week,
so I don’t know if I will have time for a podcast. We’ll see. I may do
something in advance that is not topical so I can put it up on the fly.
I have signed up American Renaissance again this year.
<a href="https://www.amren.com/2018-american-renaissance-conference/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Registration is here</a>. If you are
interested in meeting fellow hate thinkers, I highly recommend it. Jared
Taylor puts together an excellent event with interesting speakers.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I’ll be posting clips on Gab for the ADD
listeners. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android commies can take
me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on iTunes, which means
the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones. Of course, the
Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never finish.
