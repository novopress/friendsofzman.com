**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about how the primary goal
of American foreign policy is to create chaos, a post about the
challenge of buying an old truck, and the Sunday podcast. Subscribe

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the more difficult things for people to accept is that sometimes
things happen that benefit no one and for reasons under no one’s
control. Other than natural disasters, people just assume that
everything happens for a reason and someone wanted it to happen because
they gain to benefit from it happening. Conspiracy theories are born
when it is not clear who made something happen. This need to know the
who and why for everything gets filled by the conspiracy theory.

The collapse of Syria is a great example of this. Everyone just assumed
this was another American regime change operation. Then we got stories
about how it was the Turks who backed the rebels and wanted Assad gone.
Once the Israelis started grabbing land, the usual suspects came in with
their usual theories. There is even a theory that the Russians wanted
Syria to collapse to create a quagmire for the Americans to manage in
the Middle East.

All these theories make some sense, if you ignore the things that make
no sense whatsoever, like the dangers of creating chaos in the region.
The Israelis might be happy Assad is gone for emotional reasons, but
having a bunch of Islamist warlords operating on their border just added
a lot of new costs to their budget. The United States now has a new
problem to manage. Guarding those Chevon oil fields suddenly got more
expensive and more complicated.

Then you have the fact that there are many players on the Syrian board.
Before you get to the big players, you have six factions within the
rebel coalition. Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, called HTS in Western media.
They are backed by Turkey, Qatar, the CIA and led by a guy who looks
like the main character from the move *The Dictator*. He wants to create
an Islamic state in Syria. This group used to be called ISIS of Syria
but now is pretending to be a kinder, gentler ISIS.

Remnants of the Assad Regime are now forming up in the Alawite areas
they still control and presumably they will get support from Russia and
Iran. Then there is FSA/SNA and allied groups, that have been supported
by Turkey, Qatar, the U.S. State Department, and the CIA. The Kurds,
called SDF, have the protection of the American military operating in
the region. ISIS still exists, with backing of pro-Islamic forces, along
with regional tribal and Islamic groups.

What we now have is an area a little bigger than the state of New York
controlled by a collection of war lords that do not like one another
very much. The most likely outcome of this arrangement is a civil war
between the groups. The only reason anyone would want such an outcome is
if they have no exposure to it. In other words, there is no reason to
think that anyone wanted this outcome, at least none of the countries
exposed to whatever comes out of Syria.

This brings us back to that default formula. Everything happens in the
world for a reason because someone stands to benefit from it. The
cost-benefit for everyone with an interest in Syria is already negative
and promises to get much worse as things travel their natural course. In
the end, someone might make something of it, but right now it is a
chaotic mess. Who would want this result? The answer is no one because
no one saw it as a possible outcome.

Instead of a game of four-dimensional chess, Syria is an example of the
lack of second order thinking by the Turks and Americans. Since 2011
both sides have supported anti-Assad groups for different reasons.
Erdogan is obsessed with the Kurds, who operate in Turkey, Syria and
Iraq. The United States backed anti-Assad group because Assad was tight
with Russia and Iran. Their goal was to put pressure on Russian and Iran
with a slow bleed of Syria.

Based on the associated media campaign, it is clear the United States
and Turkey thought this would be a repeat of past flare ups. The rebels
would make some attacks, but the Syrian army would push them back. After
all, the Syrian army was a quarter million men with the support of
Russia and Iran. The rebels numbered around thirty thousand and lacked
air power and modern equipment. Instead, the Syrian army collapsed and
Russia and Iran did not come in to save them.

Like all large-scale human societies, Syria was a complex system made
more complex by relentless pressure from outside. Those outside failed
to appreciate this complexity, so they did not plan for what would come
from it once they started making changes to the conditions in which that
complex system existed. Like a bomb disposal crew randomly cutting
wires, the whole thing blew up and now everyone with a connection to the
region is scrambling to adjust to a new reality.

Instead of being an example of the cleverness needed for the popular
explanations about why Syria collapsed, especially the more
conspiratorial ones, Syria is an example of a lack of those things. No
one seems to have understood what was happening inside the Syrian system
and no one thought much about what could come from monkeying around with
the conditions inside Syria. It is the result of a lack of second and
third order thinking, not four-dimensional chess.

The thing about this situation is it should have been obvious to all
concerned that collapse was a possibility even before the rebel attack.
In other words, this scheme was obviously stupid, but the main players
did it anyway. This is not the first time the United States has been
this stupid. Libya, Tunisia, Egypt are three great examples of the same
poorly conceived scheme. If not for the Egyptian military, the Muslim
Brotherhood would be controlling most of North Africa.

It is a good reminder for those who love chanting about the Deep State.
The same people who create these debacles around the Muslim world are
making decisions about all sorts of things, foreign and domestic. In a
complex world, the default assumption about why anything happens is
Hanlon’s razor. “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
explained by incompetence, neglect, or ignorance.” What we are seeing In
Syria is a combination of all three.
