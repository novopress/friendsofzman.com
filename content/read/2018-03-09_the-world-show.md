Every man has his foibles and one of mine is a love of symmetry and
continuity. I like when things fit a pattern and I like when things fit
together. I spent a lot of time as kid watching the tide come in and the
tide go out. The beauty of it has always stuck with me. Little waves
inside of larger waves inside the great cycle of the tides. There is an
order to universe and there should be order in our work. Orderliness is
next to godliness.

It pleases me greatly that this show fits neatly around one theme.
Granted, it is a very general theme, but the universe is a very general
place. Even finding a small bit of order, in the most general way, means
I have found oneness with the universe. It will not bring order to your
life, or bring sanity to the word around us, but this podcast has a
unifying theme and that makes me happy. Small victories are the bread of
life.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
