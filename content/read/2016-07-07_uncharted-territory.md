Historical analogies seem like useful tools for understanding current
events. Everyone has heard, “Those who do not learn history are doomed
to repeat it” a bazillion times. Of course, our analogies are always to
past disasters. Most people reading this can probably name a dozen
people that have been compared to Hitler and another dozen examples of
Western leaders being compared to Neville Chamberlain. For the most
part, our analogies to the past are always warnings of pending doom. No
one ever compares the present to some tranquil time in the past.  
Humans have limited information processing capacity so nature devised
ways for us to quickly process information. Pattern matching is one fast
way to locate danger in a very crowded scene. If a current event
resembles a past event in some way, then maybe they have other things in
common. The logical shorthand is AX:BX::AY:BY, with X being the
commonality we know and Y being the commonality we inferred. This sort
of reasoning is really only useful in avoiding danger, thus the salience
of the Santayana quote. Otherwise, he would have said “blessed” rather
than “doomed.”  
The thing about Hitler, Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun and so on is that
they had no obvious analog in the past. The events in Germany after the
Great War were incredibly unique. In fact, there is no good example from
the past to which they compare. Similarly, the world had never seen the
likes of Genghis Khan, which is why the Mongols had so much success. One
big reason Attila was so scary to the Romans was that he was clearly a
different breed of Hun. Because he was not like his predecessors, he was
unpredictable and therefore a very frightening figure to the Romans.  
Of course, this is why comparing every petty dictator to Hitler is
silly. Saddam was not Hitler. Qaddafi was not Hitler either. Obama
cutting a deal with the Iranians may be stupid, but that does not make
him Chamberlain. In other words, our attempts to understand the present
by finding scary analogs in the past has led to one blunder after
another in the Middle East. Our pathological need to remember the
lessons of Vietnam made success in Afghanistan an impossibility. Because
we remembered the past, we made entirely new and avoidable mistakes.  
The point of this is that the upcoming election is being compared to
1980, 1968, 1932 (you know who) and Trump has been compared to everyone
from Hitler to Andrew Jackson. Everyone is groping around for a useful
historical analogy in order to make sense of this highly improbably
election. The most important political office on the planet will either
be filled by the wife of a former President or filled by a billionaire
real estate developer. It is not exactly Henry Tudor versus Richard III,
but the consequences are probably going to be much more important.  
This election is looking like an extreme outlier. Hillary Clinton is the
only presidential candidate to have been accused of violating espionage
laws. She may have beat the rap but name another candidate that had even
a whiff of traitorous intent. Trump is the first novice to run as a
major party candidate since Wendell Willkie in 1940 and that is not a
great comparison as Willkie was involved in politics his whole life.
Other than stroking checks to candidates for favors, Trump has not been
very political.  
Then there is the fact that both parties are a mess at the moment. The
Democrats have a collection of geezers at the top and no bench. Their
“young guns” are still in college. No one really wanted Clinton, but
there was no one else so she is the nominee. On the GOP side, Trump is
hated by the party and some segments of the GOP voters. He is the
nominee primarily because the rest of the party is a dog’s breakfast of
globalist fantasies and 1980’s romanticism. The sense of betrayal among
conservative voters is at revolutionary levels.  
What is most incredible about all of it is the extreme disconnect
between the party elites and their voters. Most Democrat voters would
prefer less immigration and better polices for the middle-class and
working class. Similarly, most Republican voters would respond to
similar appeals, with an emphasis on the more business friendly stuff.
Yet, neither party is offering much of anything on these issues.
Instead, they are obsessed with weird fads like transvestites or
globalist esoterica that no one outside the global elites finds
interesting.  
We do seem to be in uncharted territory, which may not be a terrible
thing. Historical analogies are often wildly mistaken, resulting is
disasters like the endless wars in the Muslim lands. The battles of the
Great War were mostly due to the generals clinging to lessons of the
past, despite the carnage they were witnessing. Much of what plagues
American politics today is a layer of Baby Boomer politicians who cannot
stop reliving the 1960’s. A break from the past could be the palate
cleanser society needs. Or we may be rocketing over a cliff.
