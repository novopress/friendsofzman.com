Steve Sailer likes to talk about how the liberal media picks very bad
mascots to champion their latest causes. Michael Brown was a good
example of it. A violent street thug killed attacking a cop is never
going to elicit much sympathy from the public. The fact that smart
people in the liberal press keep falling into this “trap” suggests
something other than collective stupidity.

The thing that Steve misses is that burning Ferguson to the ground was a
warning. Acts of senseless brutality are a type of display item intended
to communicate a message to potential foes. The Mayans built increasing
complex public structures using slave labor to show their wealth and
power to rivals. ISIS beheads Christians on the Internet to show the
rest of the Muslim world that they are the strongest horse in the barn.
Obama burned Ferguson to warn flyover country that resistance is futile.

You can see that in the case of the cop who appears to have shot  a
suspect in the back. It was caught on video and is certainly looks like
a senseless killing. Whether or not it is murder, under the laws of the
state of South Carolina is unknown. North Charleston, S.C is not taking
any chances. They saw what happened to Ferguson. So, they have fired the
cop and charged him with murder.

Since there is a possibility he could get off or there may be
exculpatory evidence out there, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">they have released his entire personnel
file to the public</a>. What’s happening here is the city is washing its
hands of the matter and turning it over to the mob. You can be sure the
cop’s lawyers will ask for a change of venue and the City will not fight
it. They want this case as far from them as possible.

You can be  sure that no one from the Social Justice League will be
protesting this violation of the man’s rights or his privacy. While
releasing video of Michael Brown beating a store clerk on his rampage
was universally condemned, releasing this white guy’s file is
celebrated. Everyone knows he is guilty so why get hung up on
technicalities?

I’m fond of saying that you blancos better polish up on your Spanish. In
all seriousness, you better study the history of Rhodesia. That’s what’s
coming to America in the mid-21st century.
